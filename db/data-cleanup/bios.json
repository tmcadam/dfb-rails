        "body": "<p>logger and farmer, was born in Vevey, Switzerland on 4 June 1904, eldest of four children of Frederick Ernest Abbott (traveller and <em>bon viveur* </em>) and his wife Ethel Hope Abbott, née Doeg, of Santa Monica, California. On leaving Sydney Grammar School in Australia in 1919, he completed his education in England before moving with his father to Saltspring Island, British Columbia (Canada) in 1922.</p><p>Abbott's father, a fine horseman who had commanded the Prince Albert Detachment in the Royal North West Mounted Police in Canada, travelled extensively with his young family in Australasia between 1905 and 1922. As a boy in Australia and New Zealand, Abbott developed his passion for, and knowledge of, bird-life. To earn a living in Canada he became a trapper. He then worked for many years in logging, initially in the harsh conditions of BC logging camps and then as co-owner of a logging business on Saltspring. In October 1932 he married Irene Oswald, recently arrived from England, who had been born in Stanley in 1912: she had lived at Malvina House, Stanley between 1912 and 1919 when her family moved to England. She would recall the story of the Battle of the Falkland Islands in December 1914 as told by her Falklands-born mother Lilian Gertrude Oswald, née Felton, daughter of John James <a href=\"/biographies/felton_john\">FELTON</a> who had built Malvina House in the 1880s. They had three sons: Michael (b1933), Donald (b1935) and Clive (b1946).</p><p>Following one logging accident too many in 1937, Abbott decided to become a mink farmer. War was declared just as the mink farm was taking off. Abbott volunteered for the Royal Canadian Artillery and sailed to England with the Third Canadian Division. Subsequently, he took part in the Normandy landings. After the war he moved his family to Frensham, Surrey, where he farmed until his wife's death in 1973.</p><p>He and his wife visited the Falklands in 1968-1969. He was immediately attracted to the way of life and opportunities for studying the Islands' spectacular bird-life. Following his wife's death he sold his farm, moved to Stanley in 1974 and built Flagstaff House on Villiers Street. He soon became actively involved in community life in Stanley, for instance joining the editorial committee of the Falkland Islands Journal (1974-1982) and becoming chairman of the local branch of the Falkland Islands Committee, flying to London to represent the Islands at a government seminar. An Anglican, he was a regular attender at the Cathedral in Stanley. He spent much time in camp in the summer. Although well into his 70s, he would make himself useful in the shearing shed; not noted for sitting back patiently, he always liked to be active.</p><p>When the Islands were invaded in 1982, Abbott stayed in Stanley. As a former soldier he was appalled at the enemy's standards: he chased away food looters more than once. When Stanley was relieved, he made his house available to 2 Para (2nd Battalion, the Parachute Regiment) and it became their mess. He travelled to England briefly on the <em>Canberra </em>in July 1982, privileged as the only civilian passenger, and then returned to the Falklands to sell his house before leaving in 1983. Flagstaff House was sold to the Standard Chartered Bank as a house for their managers. Before leaving, he presented thirteen fine nineteenth-century English coaching prints and some antique chairs to Government House in memory of his Falklands-born wife. He died in Frimley, Hampshire, in April 1986.</p><p>In his address at the subsequent memorial service, Lt Col David Chaundler, who had commanded 2 Para when Stanley was liberated, emphasised Abbott's commitment to the Islands. He had presence, energy and generosity and made his contribution to the Falklands through infectious hard work for the community.</p>",

        "body": "<p>geologist, was born on 26 February 1925 in Pietermaritzburg, South Africa. He was educated at Maritzburg College and the University of Natal, and then came to Britain in 1946 to join the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey (FIDS). He sailed south later that year for the Antarctic base at Hope Bay, where he spent the 1947 austral winter. For the 1948 winter he joined the team at Stonington Island led by Vivian <a href=\"/biographies/fuchs_sir\">FUCHS</a>, and was forced to spend a third winter in the Antarctic when ice conditions prevented relief. Fuchs and Adie undertook epic dog-sledge journeys of geological exploration along the length of the Antarctic Peninsula. In his 1982 book <em>Of Ice and Men </em>Fuchs acknowledges Adie as the man who 'taught me to drive dogs' and comments on his composure and meticulous attention to detail.</p><p>In February 1950 the Stonington base was finally relieved and soon Adie was back in the Falkland Islands. At the request of Governor <a href=\"/biographies/clifford_sir\">CLIFFORD</a>, he interrupted his journey north and spent April investigating possible sources of lime. He examined sites at Fitzroy and around Port Salvador and, with his South African background, would have relished the familiarity of the local rocks. As his subsequent publications were to show, he spent his time well, gathering additional details on the sequence of strata and evidence for formerly higher sea levels.</p><p>Back in Britain, Adie wrote up his geological observations at St John's College, Cambridge. His PhD thesis on <em>The Rocks of Graham Land </em>was accepted in 1953, and three important scientific papers on aspects of Falklands geology appeared around that same time. In 1952 he presented a synthesis of Falkland Islands stratigraphy to the International Geological Congress in Algiers, the first time it had been placed comprehensively before an international audience. In the same year, he published a short paper in <em>The Geological Magazine </em>proposing a radical geological history for the Falkland Islands involving close links with South Africa and tectonic rotation during continental drift. In 1953 his observations of the evidence for previously higher sea levels around the islands were published as a FIDS Scientific Report.</p><p>His most prescient contribution was undoubtedly the 1952 paper entitled <em>The position of the Falkland Islands in a reconstruction of Gondwanaland </em>. Therein he proposed that, prior to the break up of the ancient Gondwana supercontinent, some 200 million years ago, the Falkland Islands had been located off the south-east coast of South Africa; then they had been rotated through 180° during their passage to their current position as the Atlantic Ocean grew to its present configuration. Details of Falklands geology were presented in support, but the paper was based largely on Adie's broad intuitive understanding of the regional geology. It was a brave paper for its time. This was more than a decade before the first ripples of the plate tectonic revolution were felt in the geological mainstream and continental drift was then widely regarded as a barely respectable heresy. Adie's proposals were neglected for more than 30 years, until confirmed during the 1980s by modern methods of palaeomagnetic research.</p><p>With his PhD complete and papers published, in 1953 Adie married Aileen Hancock and began work as a geologist for the chemical company Albright and Wilson Ltd. Meanwhile, with the expansion of FIDS activity, arrangements were made for returning geologists to write up their work in the Geology Department at the University of Birmingham, and in 1956 Adie moved there as FIDS Chief Geologist and Honorary Reader in Antarctic Geology. In this role he was able to stimulate further interest in the geology of the Falkland Islands, and was instrumental in arranging for the photogeological interpretation by Mary <a href=\"/biographies/greenway_mary\">GREENWAY</a> which led to the first comprehensive geological map of the islands, published in 1972. Adie supervised map production and contributed an economic assessment to the accompanying geological description.</p><p>During the later years of his career, Adie established a formidable reputation as a scientific editor, and acted as <em>de facto  </em>Deputy Director for FIDS, which became the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) in 1962. He was formally appointed Deputy Director in 1973. He reportedly briefed the Prime Minister Mrs Thatcher during the 1982 conflict on the part which the two BAS ships could play. Though highly regarded by his peers, in more liberal times he was viewed by some younger staff as a somewhat austere and autocratic figure. He was honoured with various awards, including the Polar Medal in 1954 and the Bellingshausen Medal of the USSR Academy of Sciences in 1970. Also in 1970, he was created an OBE in recognition of his contribution to British research in the Antarctic. He is commemorated in Adie Inlet on the east coast of the Antarctic Peninsula.</p><p>Ray Adie retired in 1985 and spent much of the rest of his life in South Africa where he died on 14 May 2006 following surgery for cancer. He was survived by two of his daughters, Daphne and Virginia (his wife died in 1984 and his eldest daughter Diana died in 2002), nine grandchildren and his partner of 15 years, Nora Grice.</p>",

Born prematurely, the young prince enjoyed poor health and showed little mental ability or interest. He and his younger brother <a href=\"/biographies/george_v\">GEORGE</a> (later George V) were close and both became naval cadets in 1877.</p><p>In 1879 it was decided that the two princes should join the fully-rigged cruiser-corvette, with auxiliary engines, HMS <em>Bacchante </em>on a three year world cruise. They were supervised by their tutor the Rev John Neale Dalton, who was later to record the voyage in a ponderous two volume work of 1,500 pages, supposedly written by the two princes, but in reality almost entirely Dalton's. <em>Bacchante </em>arrived in Stanley on 24 January 1881 with a squadron of four accompanying ships after a slow (fifteen days) and stormy passage from Montevideo. Stanley, wrote Dalton, resembled an Irish village snugly nestling on the hillside and he went on to record the Islands' population, imports and exports, revenue and expenditure and cost to the home government (£500 a year). Bishop <a href=\"/biographies/stirling_waite\">STIRLING</a> called on board to describe the work of the missionaries in Tierra del Fuego, and on 25 January Governor <a href=\"/biographies/kerr_thomas\">KERR</a> and the colonial secretary <a href=\"/biographies/collins_john\">COLLINS</a> also called. But a signal brought down by ship from Montevideo reported trouble at the Cape of Good Hope: the excursion to a penguin colony arranged by Captain <a href=\"/biographies/packe_robert\">PACKE</a> was cancelled, the ships got up steam and <em>Bacchante </em>left by 7.30 the same evening. Dalton's final thoughts on the colony were that it could best be exchanged with the French for their territory of New Caledonia, but these tactless remarks passed unnoticed in the bulk of his book.</p><p>The cruise, study at Cambridge and Heidelberg, a spell in the army and the dukedom of Clarence and Avondale failed to effect any improvement in the Prince's prospects. He was betrothed to marry Princess Victoria Mary (May) of Teck in February 1892, but he died of pneumonia on 14 January at Sandringham. For the Princess, who later married his brother George and became Queen Mary, and for the country, it was a release.</p>",

        "body": " <p>Spanish naval officer, was born in San Lucar de Barrameda, Cádiz, probably in 1759 (his age was given as 57 when an extract of his service record was issued in 1816). Aldana joined the Spanish navy as a <em>guardiamarina  </em>on 6 May 1774. As an <em>alférez de navío  </em>on board the snow* <em>Marte </em>he took part in operations against the Portuguese at the island of Santa Catarina on the south coast of Brazil and Colonia del Sacramento in the River Plate between 1776 and 1778. On returning to Spain he served in several ships in the Mediterranean, operating against Barbary pirates and, in 1781 in command of a gunboat, took part in sixteen attacks on Gibraltar, resulting in his promotion to <em>teniente de fragata  </em>on 16 September that year. Promoted to <em>teniente de navío  </em>on 15 November 1784<em>,  </em>he sailed once again for the River Plate in 1785, where he joined the corvette <em>San Gil </em>as second-in-command under Pedro de <a href=\"/biographies/mesa_castro\">MESA</a> and sailed in her to Puerto de la Soledad (Port Louis). On his return to Spain he served for a time in the ship <em>Santa Isabel.  </em>He was next appointed in command of the corvette <em>Santa Escolástica </em>in July 1792, sailing in her to the River Plate for the third time and in this station he continued in command of this vessel, taking over as as <em>comandante gobernador </em>of the Spanish settlement at Puerto de la Soledad from Pedro <a href=\"/biographies/sanguineto_pedro\">SANGUINETO</a> during the first days of April 1794, until he was relieved by the same officer on 15 June 1795. Aldana relieved Sanguineto in his turn on 15 March 1796, remaining in post until 20 February 1797 when he was relieved by Luis de <a href=\"/biographies/medina_torres\">MEDINA</a>. During his second term as governor he was promoted to <em>capitán de fragata  </em>on 27 August 1796. It was also in his second term that the brig <em>Carmen y Ánimas </em>, commanded by Gerardo <a href=\"/biographies/bondas_gerardo\">BONDAS</a>, was forced to take shelter in the entrance to Port Salvador on 5 July 1796, having been damaged in a severe gale, her crew exhausted and short of water and provisions. In response to Bondas's urgent request for help Aldana sent six seamen overland with food and other necessities, with orders for Bondas to sail for Puerto de la Soledad. After losing an anchor in getting under way, Bondas anchored off the Spanish settlement on 13 July. The brig was given a complete overhaul with the limited resources available and Bondas sailed on 23 October, presumably to Montevideo, to report his inability to carry out the annual cruise round the islands to discover any attempt by foreigners to form settlements or to exploit the marine resources. With the benefit of his experience as second-in-command to Pedro de Mesa (1786-8) Aldana knew well the administrative peculiarities of the colony and was familiar with various localities on West Falkland. Returning to Montevideo on being relieved by Luis de Medina, Aldana remained in the the River Plate naval command until 27 February 1802, when he returned to Cádiz on board the frigate <em>Santa Magdalena </em>. His final promotion to <em>capitán de navío </em>took place on 23 February 1809. He retired from the navy on 9 February 1816.</p>",

At 14 he joined the navy and served in <em>Euryalus </em>and <em>St George </em>visiting the Mediterranean, the West Indies and North America. Promotion came rapidly: lieutenant in 1863 and, skipping commander, captain in 1866. He was created Duke of Edinburgh in May 1866 and the following year commissioned HMS <em>Galatea </em>(3220 tons) and began a world tour which was to include South America, the Cape of Good Hope and Australia.</p><p>In November 1867 the Admiralty asked the Colonial Office to inform governors of the Duke of Edinburgh's cruise in <em>Galatea </em>during 1868/9, and in the following July Governor <a href=\"/biographies/robinson_sir\">ROBINSON</a> replied that: 'HRH will be received here with demonstrations of affectionate loyalty for which the inhabitants of this distant and isolated dependency are remarkable'. In the event, the Duke was shot and wounded by a Fenian* sympathiser while in Australia in 1868 and he returned to England to recover. So it was not until 24 February 1871 that <em>Galatea </em>arrived in Stanley to be received at the Public Jetty by the colonial secretary (Byng), the colonial surgeon (Watts), GM Dean and FE <a href=\"/biographies/cobb_frederick\">COBB</a>.

He was educated in naval colleges at Osborne and Dartmouth and entered the Royal Navy in 1911. He was appointed to the light cruiser  <em>Glasgow </em>in 1914, promoted lieutenant shortly thereafter and saw action in the battles of Coronel and the Falkland Islands. Late in 1917 he was appointed to the light cruiser  <em>Newcastle </em>. He retired from the navy at his own request with a gratuity in 1920, and was promoted to lieutenant commander on the reserve list in 1923. Alison was married in 1919 to Lilian Phoebe Phillips, the daughter of LC Phillips of South Africa - they had one daughter, Phoebe Ann.</p><p>Alison became magistrate at South Georgia on 22 August 1927. The previous substantive magistrate had been Edward <a href=\"/biographies/binnie_edward\">BINNIE</a>, whose appointment ended on 1 April of that year. The post of magistrate had hitherto been a local appointment by the Falkland Islands Government, but other considerations seem to have influenced the choice of candidate on this occasion. A special memorial service was being planned at South Georgia for the Antarctic explorer Sir Ernest <a href=\"/biographies/shackleton_sir\">SHACKLETON</a>, who had died there in January 1922. It is known that Shackleton wrote a letter from Antarctic waters aboard the  <em>Endurance  </em>to a member of the Alison family dated 3 December 1914 and this connection may have led to Frederick Alison becoming involved with the memorial service arrangements.</p><p>Against this background Alison arrived at South Georgia, remaining there a month or two before moving onwards to the Falkland Islands. There he was, somewhat exceptionally, appointed a provisional member of ExCo for a period of one month. The purpose would have been to set out and finalise the proposals for Shackleton's memorial service. These deliberations over, Alison returned to South Georgia from Port Stanley aboard the  <em>Fleurus  </em>on 20 December, accompanying Governor <a href=\"/biographies/hodson_sir\">HODSON</a> and other officials on a roundabout route via the South Shetland Islands. The formal ceremony took place on the 24 February 1928 when Governor Hodson unveiled the carved granite memorial erected over Shackleton's grave. Alison remained at South Georgia for only a few months longer. He was, reported the governor, 'addicted to excessive drinking' and was sent straight home with his wife and daughter on the whaler  <em>Harpon  </em>on 16 May 1928. In his absence Nelson Jones, the magistrate's clerk, took over.</p><p>He was declared bankrupt in the  <em>London Gazette </em>on 1 April 1930. Promoted commander on the retired list in 1933, he was recalled to the colours in October 1939 and appointed to HMS <em>Flora </em>, the depot ship at Invergordon. In 1940 he was relieved of his appointment as 'incapable of carrying out his duties'. The family retired to Rye, in Sussex. Alison succeeded his brother Archibald to the title, becoming fifth Baronet in December 1967. He died on 13 January 1970: there being no male heir, the baronetcy became extinct.</p>",

The Allardyces were well-known public figures in Aberdeen, and were much involved in charitable affairs. William Allardyce was educated at the Gymnasium School in Aberdeen, and also at the Oxford Military College. He was a good scholar and a fine sportsman, excelling at cricket, with both bat and ball</p><p><strong>To Fiji</strong></p><p>At the age of 18 Allardyce entered the Colonial Service and he was posted to Fiji as clerk and interpreter. During the next 25 years Allardyce occupied almost every position in the Fijian government, eventually becoming receiver-general and colonial secretary. In 1895 he married Constance Angel Greene at Melbourne, and their two daughters were born during Allardyce's service in Fiji. Both girls were given Fijian names - Vita (later Mrs A Mabutt) and Keva (later Mrs C Butler, who was married in Tasmania in 1923 while Allardyce was serving as Governor). During his period of service in Fiji, Allardyce wrote a number of academic papers on the Fijian language, a history of England in the Fijian language and also a history of the Fijian wars. From 1890 to 1899 he edited a Fijian newspaper called <em>Na Mata. </em>He was instrumental in the decision of the Fijian Government to build a national museum, and when he left Fiji in 1904 Allardyce donated his large collection of Fijian artefacts and books to the Suva Town Hall. This material provided the basis of the national collection. Throughout his life Allardyce collected ethnic artefacts and rare books, and encouraged the establishment of museums.</p><p><strong>The Falkland Islands</strong></p><p>Allardyce's tenure of office as governor of the Falkland Islands (1904-1915) was a notable period in the colony's history and development. Allardyce has been well described as a 'keen observer and conservator of cultural, historical and natural resources.' The great Swedish scientist Carl <a href=\"/biographies/skottsberg_carl\">SKOTTSBERG</a>, who visited the Falkland Islands in 1911, commented: 'He is warmly interested in the material as well as the spiritual welfare of his colony, and we fully recognised his appreciation of our scientific work, which he tried to promote as far as lay in his power.'</p><p>Allardyce's term of office as governor coincided with the advent of the modern era of whaling; the establishment of the Dependencies of the Falkland Islands; the introduction of wireless communication within the Islands (and Antarctica and the Battle of the Falkland Islands in 1914. The foundations of the social services of the Falkland Islands were laid; the education and medical services of the Islands were extended - Victoria Cottage Home (a nursing home) was opened, and the King Edward VII Memorial Hospital was completed (among the first patients were casualties from the 1914 Battle of the Falkland Islands). The first Senior School was built and opened in 1907 by Mrs Constance Allardyce; Governor Allardyce personally supervised the construction of the school. The school leaving age was raised to 14 in 1910, and Allardyce ensured that additional accommodation was provided in Stanley for camp children. At Allardyce's instigation work was begun on a new Town Hall, which was designed to include a library and museum; both these amenities were the result of the initiative of Mrs Allardyce. Testimony of her personal commitment to the Stanley Museum, and of her generous donation of artefacts can be found in the <em>Falkland Islands Magazine and Church Paper </em>: 'We residents of Stanley cannot be too grateful for the legacy that Mrs. Allardyce has given us'.</p><p>When news of the death of (now Lady) Constance Allardyce in 1919 reached the Falkland Islands, the <em>Falkland Islands Magazine and Church Paper </em>reprinted part of an eloquent tribute that had been made in the <em>Nassau Guardian  </em>on 26 November 1919:</p><blockquote><blockquote>The welfare of the young and the relief of the suffering have always been of outstanding interest to her, and in the Falkland Islands she started the Girl Guide movement and introduced the work of the St. Johns Ambulance Association, herself being many a time the means of relieving the suffering and saving life in the outlying homes of the shepherds, miles away from the nearest doctor ... With fine mental equipment and being a great reader with a very retentive memory, Lady Allardyce was also interested in scientific pursuits, and in this direction her discovery of a complete specimen of a Trilobite in the Falklands where previously even Darwin had discovered only traces, and the find of a unique land shell, named in her honour <em>Diaphorostoma allardycea,  </em>stands to her credit. She also furnished shells to several museums ... Lady Allardyce excelled as a horsewoman and as an all-round athlete ... Prior to her marriage she was a Sunday School teacher and throughout her life the ideals of Christian character guided her activities and service.</blockquote></blockquote><p>During Allardyce's term as governor the first effective sanitary system for Stanley was built, and street lighting on Ross Road was installed. A public telephone exchange was established. The Boy Scout movement began in November 1912 under Allardyce's direction and patronage. Radio communication with navy ships and with the mainland of South America was established.</p><p>Although sheep farming was the dominant economic activity of the Falkland Islands, Allardyce was concerned about excessive dependence upon the wool industry and he urged the establishment of secondary industries.</p><p><strong>South Georgia and Whaling</strong></p><p>With Captain Carl Anton <a href=\"/biographies/larsen_carl\">LARSEN</a>'s arrival on South Georgia in 1904 the modern era of whaling began. From the beginning of this new industry Allardyce was insistent on control and regulation. He was responsible for the drafting of the <em>Ordinance to regulate the Whale fishery 1906 </em>. (This Ordinance also protected seals, penguins, and some other species of birds). The Ordinance required all whaling expeditions to call at Stanley en route south to the whaling grounds to collect a licence; it also required whaling factory ships to embark a customs officer, and to restrict catchers to two vessels per floating factory ship. Further Whaling Ordinances were enacted in 1908 and 1911.</p><p>Before the advent of Southern Ocean whaling almost nothing was known in the Colonial Office about South Georgia; in the early days there even appears to have been some confusion about the rightful ownership of, and sovereignty over, the Island. Whaling removed any doubts as to its value. Allardyce soon realised the importance and worth of South Georgia as a base for whaling, and its potential for raising revenue for the Falkland Islands economy - which was in a parlous state. Despite the excellent financial prospects of whaling for the Colony, and his determination to regulate the industry, Allardyce was well aware of the history of destruction on the northern whaling grounds, and the future possibility for the Southern Ocean whale stocks: 'that in a few years at the present rate of catch there are likely to be very few whales left in that region.'</p><p>Allardyce was also deeply concerned about the remaining stocks of fur seals which had suffered grievously since hunting began in the late eighteenth century. In a confidential despatch of 1909, to the secretary of state for the colonies, Allardyce revealed his concern for the conservation of the remaining fur seals, and of the parlous state of the rookeries:</p><blockquote><blockquote>Considering how small they are and the limited number of seals on them at the moment ... if things are permitted to remain in the unsatisfactory condition in which they have been in for many years past, the result is almost certain to be the absolute depletion, if not the entire extermination, of the Fur Seal in and around the Falklands, and the loss to Government of what, if properly managed, would prove in a few years to be a valuable source of revenue ... I have merely to refer you to my Confidential Despatch of 29 December 1908, containing particulars of a raid on the Fur Seal rookery at Volunteer Rocks, almost within sight of the seat of Government. On that occasion the rookery was depleted and the seal pups left to die ... When the rookeries are properly protected it is probable that the number of seals will increase rapidly.</blockquote></blockquote><p>On 25 August 1909 Allardyce left Stanley in the steam whaler <em>Swona  </em>to inspect the newly-erected whaling factory at New Island belonging to <a href=\"/biographies/salvesen_harold\">SALVESEN</a>. Seventy people were employed at the whaling station - including the crews of whale catchers and two large steamers. In a despatch sent to the Colonial Office after his return from his visit Allardyce discussed the colony's natural resources and his concern that some landowners would not face up to their responsibilities for the sustainable development of the Falkland Islands:</p><blockquote><blockquote>The Colonists are non-progressive, and not unnaturally perhaps are perfectly satisfied with a sheep farming investment which has given a return of late years of over 30%, and permits them after a few years spent in this Colony to retire and live in a substantial competence in the Old Country, and join the band of absentee owners ... Needless to say such action does not make for the development of the country or its progress, but permits them in great measure to evade their responsibilities to the Colony in which they have made their fortunes.</blockquote></blockquote><p>At some point towards the end of 1910 Allardyce became alarmed at a discussion which was taking place in the Colonial Office about appeasing Argentine claims to sovereignty. On 24 December 1910, in reply to a secret despatch from London dated 11 November 1910 about the possible cession of the South Orkneys to the Argentine Republic, Allardyce strongly opposed the proposal on the grounds of the financial consequences for the Islands, as well as being: '... almost certain to be misunderstood in South America, and might hereafter form an unfortunate precedent for other demands, and be used to materially weaken our claim to possessing any territory in these seas.'</p><p><strong>Conservation</strong></p><p>As part of his strategy to avoid wastage Allardyce promulgated new whaling regulations on 6 February 1911. Allardyce insisted that whale carcasses be fully utilised, and that the number of catchers per factory ship be restricted. These restrictions were often made in the face of opposition from the whaling companies and from the Colonial Office. In his budget speech of 1911 Allardyce outlined his conviction that natural resources should be used wisely and not wasted. 'The policy of this Government will continue to be that of endeavouring to establish a permanent industry rather than the rapid collection of a large revenue.' Separate licences were to be issued for South Shetlands, South Orkneys and the Falkland Islands, allowing one floating factory and two whale catchers per licence to operate. Allardyce hoped that the use of floating factories would end the 'strip and dump' attitude. The regulations permitted no more than ten licences to be issued for South Shetlands. South Georgia licensing continued to be arranged separately. Constant vigilance was required on the part of the regulators. On 10 May 1911 the customs officer who accompanied the <em>Sobraon  </em>expedition drew attention to the excessive waste of carcasses after the blubber had been flensed off and the oil removed. This report prompted Allardyce to permit licencees to build a shore processing factory on Deception Island - despite the shortness of the season (four months) - so as to use the whole carcass of the whale. Government whaling inspectors and magistrates were soon appointed to monitor the whaling companies' activities.</p><p>Allardyce sent James Innes <a href=\"/biographies/wilson_james\">WILSON</a> as stipendiary magistrate to administer South Georgia in 1911; Wilson was also to oversee the developing elephant sealing industry. The sealing quotas proved remarkably well-judged; the 6,000 annual quota remained unchanged until sealing ceased in 1964, except between 1947-52 when it was unwisely increased.</p><p>Although he granted the whaling companies licences for floating factories, Allardyce clearly preferred land stations. With the technology then available floating factories were unable to utilise the whole of the carcass, and: 'The floating factory allows the unscrupulous to flense the blubber ... and get rid of the rest by simply cutting it adrift ... Land stations improve utilisation and make supervision more practicable.'</p><p>Allardyce's solution to this problem was to have the floating factories working in conjunction with shore stations. In practice, however, the magistrate at South Georgia constantly complained about how poorly even the land-based whaling companies carried out the utilisation requirement in their leases. At one stage Allardyce considered repossessing the leased land if the companies did not improve the utilisation. He felt that there was clear evidence that companies were catching more whales than they could dispose of, and also that whole whale carcasses were being handed over by licensed companies to unlicensed 'processing companies.' 'When not under the eye of the Magistrate ... who is to know whether flensed carcasses only or whole carcasses are used?' The real problem of enforcement was that there was only one government official for the seven whaling stations, which were widely scattered on the northern coast of South Georgia. The magistrate's problems were compounded by the fact that his only means of transport was provided by the, often offending, whaling companies.</p><p>As a result of Allardyce's desire to provide greater control and monitoring, Grytviken in South Georgia and Port Foster at Deception Island were designated 'ports of entry' in 1912, and customs officers and magistrates appointed.</p><p>Allardyce was well aware of the financial benefits which whaling brought to the Falkland Islands. The income from the whaling industry became increasingly important as the opening of the Panama Canal reduced passing shipping and the considerable income from ship repair.</p><p>During the latter part of 1911 the industrious Allardyce began to show signs of understanding the limits of his power and authority: 'Until such time as there is an international agreement on the subject little practical protection can be afforded to the whale.' By September 1911 he is clearly aware of the fate which awaited the whales of the Southern Ocean and the potential consequences of their demise for the colony:</p><blockquote><blockquote>I am not unmindful of the probable transient nature of the whaling industry around the Dependency, and the need to secure for this Colony, whilst whales are plentiful, a substantial balance to compensate for the lean years which are sure to follow later ... of the stagnation of the Colony prior to the advent of the whaling boom you are aware ... the Government was under continuous obligation to the Falkland Islands Company ... I cannot too strongly urge that provision be made for still further strengthening the accumulated assets of the Colony against a possible collapse of the whaling industry during the next decade.</blockquote></blockquote><p>But in 1914 the exigencies of a wartime economy overrode all the previous careful management of the Colonial Office and the cautious conservationist approach of Governor Allardyce. Whale oil became of great importance as a source of glycerine for the making of explosives, government restrictions were relaxed, and the number of whale catchers allowed at South Georgia was temporarily increased to thirty-two. The Falkland Islands and Dependencies were fortunate to have a governor of the calibre of William Allardyce at a crucial period in their history when the whaling industry was expanding at its fastest rate. Some commentators however, mainly Norwegian, are not so complimentary about Allardyce. Tønnessen's comment is typical:</p><blockquote><blockquote>He had shouldered the main responsibility for the administration of this development, which had imposed a tremendous burden of work to which he had not been entirely equal. According to his successor, W. Douglas <a href=\"/biographies/young_sir\">YOUNG</a>, Allardyce left his office in a state of near chaos: a large number of decisions had been made orally, without reference to the Colonial Office or without being duly recorded. He had gradually adopted an attitude of opposition to the Colonial Office, and felt that he had not been given due credit for his services ... He failed to understand that whaling also had political consequences, and that regulation of it, and the question of sovereignty in the Antarctic, were bound to become international problems.</blockquote></blockquote><p>This assessment is not entirely fair or accurate. The antipathy of some Norwegian historians stems from Allardyce being perceived to be constantly restricting the operations of the whaling companies, and because he appeared to favour British interests. Other Norwegian historians have recognised Allardyce's positive contribution. 'He was in many respects a man ahead of his time when it came to the management of the whale resources.'</p><p>The weakness of concentrating purely upon regulation to control the use of natural resources is clearly revealed in the story of Governor Allardyce. Despite his good intentions, the greed of the sealers and whalers and the activities of poachers constantly undermined the regulatory system.</p><p><strong>War and Battle</strong></p><p>Towards the end of his period of service in the Falkland Islands all of Allardyce's abilities were tested to the full during the Southern Ocean naval crisis, at the outbreak of World War I, from August to December 1914. Allardyce was able to manage the crisis efficiently because he had the wireless station which he had been instrumental in building on the Falkland Islands. Within ten days of the outbreak of war Allardyce learnt that two German steamers, the <em>Rhahotis  </em>and the <em>Memphis,  </em>were in the vicinity of the Falkland Islands, with 2000 reservists on board. Fortunately the raiders did not attack the Falkland Islands. Allardyce ordered the internment of German nationals on the Falkland Islands, and he strictly controlled the flow of information leaving the Falkland Islands via coastal shipping. Allardyce's next anxiety was the activities of the German cruiser <em>Dresden </em>- which was expected to attack the Falkland Islands in order to destroy the wireless station. Elaborate defensive measures were ordered by Allardyce - including direct telephone communications from various lookout positions to the governor's office and bedroom. There were a number of false alarms, and each time Allardyce rushed to bury cipher books and other various secret papers in a specially prepared place in the Government House peat shed.</p><p>With the arrival of Admiral <a href=\"/biographies/cradock_sir\">CRADOCK</a> and his squadron (including <em>Good Hope, Glasgow  </em>and <em>Monmouth </em>) Allardyce found both an ally and a good friend, but he soon realised that Cradock's ships would be outnumbered and outgunned by the German squadron operating off the western coast of Chile, and there was a possibility, if Cradock were defeated, that the Falkland Islands would be invaded. Allardyce invited the Executive Council to issue a public notice advising women and children to leave Stanley for safer areas in the Camp. The order was issued and within two weeks the evacuation was complete.</p><p>Cradock's ships left the Falkland Islands on 23 October 1914 and on 1 November - off Coronel, on the Chilean coast - <em>Good Hope  </em>and <em>Monmouth </em>were sunk with all hands. Allardyce now feared the worst, and made plans to withdraw, with his staff, to Mount William. He ordered the Treasury to burn all paper currency and bury the bullion. After some sleepless nights, and a few false alarms, Allardyce was relieved to see a powerful British naval squadron, under the command of Admiral <a href=\"/biographies/sturdee_sir\">STURDEE</a>, arrive in the Falkland Islands. The ships arrived just in time, because the next day lookouts on Sapper Hill reported that five German cruisers, under the command of Admiral von <a href=\"/biographies/spee_maximilian\">SPEE</a>, were steaming towards Port Stanley. The first shots were fired on 8 December 1914 by the <em>Canopus  </em>which was in Stanley harbour. In the ensuing battle most of the German ships and their colliers were sunk. Subsequent interrogation of prisoners of war revealed how accurate Allardyce's assessment had been. The German intention had been to destroy the Wireless Station and to demand the unconditional surrender of the Colony. Failure to surrender would have resulted in a large force being landed and Stanley was to be razed to the ground. It gave Allardyce particular pleasure in his correspondence after the battle to note that 'throughout this extended period 5th August to 19th December our small 5kw Wireless Station, which I had such great difficultly in obtaining and erecting, covered itself with glory.'</p><p>Allardyce sometimes found scant support for his policies from the Colonial Office. Heyburn comments, for example, that his attempts to restrict the number of whale catchers were not well received in London: 'unfortunately, the Colonial Office refused to go along with such strong medicine.' Henry Heyburn rightly described Allardyce as a pioneer Antarctic conservationist; a man of 'broad intellectual interests, tough minded resolution and ready wit. Allardyce's interest in the history of places where he worked is illustrated by the fact that he published a slender monograph (printed in Stanley in 1909) entitled <em>The Story of the Falkland Islands 1500-1842  </em>which is 'effectively the first summary account of the discovery and the early settlement of the island.'</p><p>One of Allardyce's last acts as governor of the Falkland Islands was to present a collection of portraits of explorers to the Falkland Islands Museum, and of governors and administrators to Government House. His most visible memorial is the Allardyce mountain range in South Georgia. A harbour on South Georgia is named Allardyce Harbour; Cape Constance and Mount Constance, in South Georgia, are named after Allardyce's first wife.</p><p><strong>Later Postings</strong></p><p>Allardyce served as governor of the Bahamas from 1915 until 1920 where he continued his wide-ranging cultural and philanthropic interests. Lady Allardyce was very active in war work and she was one of the first recipients of the OBE. She died suddenly on 23 November 1919. In 1920, when he was in San Francisco, Allardyce married again. His second wife was Mrs Elsie Elizabeth Goodfellow, the daughter of J F Stewart of Dundee, and the widow of Adam Goodfellow from Edinburgh.</p><p>Allardyce became governor of Tasmania in 1920, but his tenure of office was a short one because he found that he could not live on the salary of £2,750. In his obituary in <em>The Times </em>, it was noted that he had: 'never heard of a King's representative in any state or Crown Colony who had to maintain his kitchen garden out of his own pocket.' And again: 'if the Colonial Office had no further use for his services, he would settle in England and amuse himself with fly-fishing and cricket'.</p><p>In 1922 Allardyce moved to his final appointment as the governor of Newfoundland (1922-1928). During his term of office the Labrador boundary dispute between Newfoundland and Canada was resolved. Allardyce took a keen interest in forestry and was an enthusiastic salmon fisherman. Lady Allardyce started the Girl Guide movement on Newfoundland. She also founded an organisation, called the Outport Nursing and Industrial Association, which was responsible for sending fully trained nurses, and other medical staff, to remote rural settlements. Both Allardyce and his wife were committed to practical social action in an attempt to deal with the deep-seated social problems of Newfoundland.</p><p>Allardyce was awarded the CMG in 1902; he was knighted (KCMG) in 1916 and advanced to GCMG in 1927. In August 1916 Sir William Allardyce and his second wife were appointed a Knight and Lady of Grace of the Order of St John. In 1929 St Andrews University awarded Allardyce an honorary LL D.</p><p>Shortly after his retirement Allardyce was (briefly) the Chairman of the Viking Whaling Company. He died on 9 June 1930, and is buried in Eversley Parish Church, Hampshire. Allardyce's second wife was awarded the CBE in 1945 and died in 1962.</p><p>Allardyce's official correspondence can be found in the National Archives, Kew. Copies of his official despatches during his tenure as governor of the Falkland Islands can also be found at the Scott Polar Research Institute. Lady Allardyce donated thirteen volumes of scrapbooks and press cuttings to the Royal Commonwealth Society in 1942, in response to appeals for gifts to restore the Library after war damage. These are now held at the University Library in Cambridge.</p>",

In compliance with his instructions, which were much the same as those issued to all his predecessors, one of his first actions was to send acting <em>Teniente </em>Vicente Villa in the snow <em>San Cristóbal  </em>to reconnoitre the former British settlement in Port Egmont as well as the rest of West Falkland Island. In a lengthy report to Altolaguirre, Villa stated that he saw nothing to suggest any recent signs of people or vessels in the area. Taking advantage of the departure of the <em>Nuestra Señora de los Dolores </em>with Medina, Altolaguirre informed Viceroy Vertiz that all medicines in the colony had been used up and replenishments were urgently needed, sending a list of his requirements. Altolaguirre also reminded the Viceroy that regulations dated 9 August 1776 provided for a naval frigate to be always stationed at Puerto de la Soledad. On 30 December 1782 Viceroy Vertiz informed Altolaguirre that <em>Capitán de fragata </em>Fulgencio D Montemayor would be his successor. The Viceroy added that he had arranged for the <em>San Cristóbal </em>to be replaced by the brig <em>Rosario </em>to provide for the needs of the island and her manning would have to be reduced to the minimum required. Her consort, the brig <em>Nuestra Señora del Carmen </em>, commanded by Jose Ignacio Goicoechea, was specifically ordered to reconnoitre Port Egmont. On 8 April 1782 Altolaguirre submitted a manifesto, in which he stated that the establishment, including the crew of the <em>San Cristóbal </em>, consisted of 7 officers, 34 soldiers forming the garrison, 41 seamen and 43 convicts. The livestock comprised 534 cattle, 50 horses and 75 geese. Altolaguirre was relieved by Fulgencio <a href=\"/biographies/montemayor_fulgencio\">MONTEMAYOR</a> on 1 April 1783.</p>",

        "body": "<p>Swedish geologist, polar explorer, and archaeologist, was born in Knista, in the province of Närke, Sweden, on 3 July 1874, the only child of Johan and Hedvig Andersson, née Lekberg, (farmers). The abundance of fossils in Närke stimulated an early interest in palaeontology, and in 1892 he went to Uppsala University to study geology, palaeontology, chemistry and zoology. He gained his PhD in 1901 for his work on the geology of Bear Island in the Arctic Ocean, and was appointed assistant professor in geology at Uppsala. His studies prepared him well for the Swedish South Polar Expedition of 1901-1903 led by Otto <a href=\"/biographies/nordenskjold_nils\">NORDENSKJÖLD</a>, a colleague at Uppsala. Andersson was deputy leader of the Expedition and in charge of the 1902 leg which undertook research in the Falklands, Tierra del Fuego, South Georgia and the Antarctic Peninsula.</p><p>Andersson arrived in the Falklands on 21 February 1902 on board the <em>Orellana </em>from Liverpool, and had to wait for a few weeks spent exploring the surroundings of Stanley, Port Stephens and Fox Bay, where he stayed with Mary Ann and George Hurst, finding fossils similar to those discovered by <a href=\"/biographies/darwin_charles\">DARWIN</a>. On 11 April he departed in the <em>Antarctic  </em>for South Georgia where he remained until 15 June pursuing topographical, geological and botanical surveys, with Samuel August Duse (cartographer) and Carl <a href=\"/biographies/skottsberg_carl\">SKOTTSBERG</a> (botanist). Andersson named two large glaciers in the western arm of Cumberland Bay as the Lyell and Geikie glaciers after Scottish geologists Charles Lyell and Archibald Geikie.</p><p>On 4 July the <em>Antarctic </em>returned to the Falklands, remaining through the winter. Andersson and Skottsberg went to Port Louis for almost a month studying stone runs, in particular Prince's Street. His intention was to produce 'a map of the stone-river' but progress was slow and the map was unfinished when he returned to Stanley. Nevertheless the map was published as part of his 1907 paper written for his friend Thor <a href=\"/biographies/halle_thore\">HALLE</a>, who also undertook geological work in the Falklands.</p><p>Andersson's observations led him to introduce the term <em>solifluction </em>(literally: soil flow) for the process by which hillside detritus (rock particles, soil and sediment) moves from higher to lower ground. Andersson recognised that stone runs were not the result of present-day <em>solifluction </em>, but associated with an earlier period of more severe climate characterised by heavy snowfalls in winter and summer snowmelt capable of moving large boulders. Although stone runs have continued to attract interest since Andersson's explanation and some alternative mechanisms have been introduced into the debate, <em>solifluction </em>is generally accepted as the principal means by which the boulders reached their present locations.</p><p>After departing Stanley on 6 September for Tierra del Fuego, the <em>Antarctic </em>stopped for two days at Port Albemarle thus enabling Andersson to visit and sample the igneous and metamorphic rocks in the cliffs at Cape Meredith. Unfortunately the samples were lost when the <em>Antarctic </em>went down in the Weddell Sea in February 1903.</p><p>Following almost two months in Tierra del Fuego the <em>Antarctic </em>returned south to meet Nordenskjöld's winter party, but this part of the expedition did not go according to plan because of extensive sea ice. Andersson, Duse and Grunden (seaman) attempted to reach Snow Hill Island by an overland route but were forced to winter in a crude stone hut which they built at Hope Bay. The following spring they succeeded in reaching Nordenskjöld, and were joined by CA <a href=\"/biographies/larsen_carl\">LARSEN</a> and some of the crew of the <em>Antarctic </em>, which had been trapped and crushed by the ice. The expedition was eventually rescued by the Argentine naval vessel <em>Uruguay </em>in November 1903.</p><p>On returning to Sweden, Andersson resumed his career at Uppsala University and in 1906 became Director of the Swedish Geological Survey. In 1914 he was appointed advisor to the Geological Survey of China on oil and coal resources, staying until 1924. As the Geological Survey was reduced after 1916, he undertook archaeological research into the origins of Chinese civilisations and became known affectionately as <em>Kina Gunnar </em>(China Gunnar) or China's first archaeologist. Using the artefacts he collected, the Swedish parliament established a museum of Far Eastern Antiquities in Stockholm in 1926. Andersson was awarded a professorial chair in Far Eastern Archaeology and appointed the museum's first director. He retired in 1939.</p><p>Andersson married Eira Johansson in 1950 when he was 76 and in hospital. His two autobiographies mention three children (two daughters and a son), born between approximately 1900 and 1910, but make no reference to their mother(s) or a previous marriage. He died on 29 October 1960. The Museum of Far Eastern Antiquities is generally regarded as Andersson's legacy, but his time in the Falklands, South Georgia and Antarctica produced a wealth of geological information around which many subsequent studies have been constructed, and a tale of endurance now largely forgotten or overshadowed by the exploits of those who came later.</p>",

        "body": "<p>mariner and farmer, was born in the town of Horsens, on the east coast of Denmark, on 19 February 1887, the son of Jens Andreasen, a merchant. He decided on a sea-going career and began working on fishing boats in the Baltic, but soon ventured further afield, gaining experience on both sailing ships and steamers crossing the North Atlantic. In Halifax, Nova Scotia, he joined a sealing schooner, the  <em>Agnes G Donahoe </em>, a 100-ton vessel with a crew of 20, about to leave for the South Atlantic. The ship arrived in Stanley at the beginning of February 1907, carrying 1,382 sealskins and having just lost the mainsail in a storm. Three other sealing schooners were already in harbour and two of them had several cases of beri-beri, the vitamin deficiency disease, among their crews. A single 'slight case' was reported by the Church Magazine on the  <em>Agnes G Donahoe </em>. This was Andreasen, who was subsequently diagnosed as being too ill to continue on the voyage and had to remain in Stanley when the ship sailed.</p><p>After a convalescence of several months, he was employed by the FIC on their newly-built schooner, the <em>Malvina </em>. She had been equipped with an engine, so Andreasen, with his experience of both sail and steam, was perfectly qualified to work on her. The FIC colonial manager, WA <a href=\"/biographies/harding_william\">HARDING</a> wrote to the directors in London 'Andreasen came from one of the Canadian sealing schooners ... there is no other man here who could be trusted to have anything whatever to do with the engine'. In 1910 the  <em>Malvina </em>was wrecked in Reef Channel and Andreasen was then engaged to work at Port San Carlos, where he remained for the next thirty-seven years, first as foreman and later as manager. Shortly after beginning work at Port San Carlos, he married Emily Andersen at the Tabernacle in Stanley. She was the daughter of James Andersen, also a Danish mariner, who had arrived in the Falklands as a young man fifty years earlier and married Mary Riley, whose father was one of the military <a href=\"/biographies/pensioners_the\">PENSIONERS</a>. The Andreasens had three children, Christian Emilie (b1911) Mary Clarissa Elizabeth (b1913) and Sturdee Valdemar Jens (b1915).</p><p>In World War I, Chris Andreasen played a key role in the defence of the Falklands. He had joined the FIVF in 1908 and been called out with the rest of the force on the outbreak of hostilities in August 1914. On the morning of 8 December, when the newly-arrived British squadron under Admiral <a href=\"/biographies/sturdee_sir\">STURDEE</a> was coaling in Stanley Harbour, Andreasen was on look out duty on Sapper Hill. From here, he was the first to observe and report the approach of the German squadron. His maritime experience enabled him to give Admiral Sturdee accurate and detailed information over a telephone line on the type, distance, speed and bearing of the approaching ships, so that in spite of having to prepare for battle in haste, Sturdee had a clear picture of the opposition. This was one of the critical factors in the ensuing British victory in the Battle of the Falkland Islands. Sturdee was so impressed by the quality of the intelligence he had received that on his return to Stanley after the battle, he asked that Private Andreasen visit the flagship, HMS <em>Invincible </em>, so that the Admiral could thank him personally for his contribution. A special parade was ordered by Governor <a href=\"/biographies/allardyce_sir\">ALLARDYCE</a>, at which Andreasen was officially and publicly commended. He was subsequently awarded a gold watch by the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, for services to the Royal Navy. He had also been given a Bank of England five-pound note as a personal gift from Admiral Sturdee, who had signed it, and until the end of his life he proudly kept this in a frame with other memorabilia of the Battle of the Falklands.</p><p>His career in farming was equally successful and he was twice manager of Port San Carlos for extended periods, the first time in the 1920s and the second time in the 1940s. He continued to serve in the Defence Force and was given a commission in World War II, when he organised coast-watching and assisted with the formation of the Mounted Rifles. In 1947 he retired to Stanley, where he lived with his wife in Jubilee Villas on Ross Road. He returned to visit Denmark twice and on the second occasion, in 1958, the King of Denmark conferred on him a Knighthood of the Order of the Dannebrog. This was in recognition of the credit Andreasen had brought to his native country by his distinguished services abroad. He was immensely patriotic and flew the Danish flag outside his house in Stanley, often entertaining the crews from the Danish charter boats which called at regular intervals. A placid person, he was a familiar figure in Stanley in his old age, smoking his pipe or out walking with his cane, raising his hat to people with old-fashioned courtesy.</p><p>Andreasen died in Stanley on 30 August 1962. In an obituary in the  <em>Falkland Islands Monthly Review </em>, Norman <a href=\"/biographies/cameron_norman\">CAMERON</a> wrote:</p><blockquote><blockquote>Chris.Andreasen was one of that rare breed of seamen to whom the Colony and the sheep farms owe a lasting debt. Let us acknowledge it here. Their calling was the sea, but finding themselves through the accidents or hazards of a seafarer's life ashore in these islands, they turned their backs on the sea and gave their skills and their energies to the service of the farms, taking sheep and sheep work in their stride. But sails gave way to steam, the Panama Canal stole the traffic from Cape Horn, and these tough, invaluable men came to us no longer. Stranded on a foreign shore, a stranger in a strange land, to acquire the difficult language, to engage in the industry of the country, to rise to the top in that industry and in so doing to make yourself one with the people, these are not simple achievements. They must have demanded a full measure of understanding and goodwill, courage and determination, with all of which Chris was abundantly endowed.</blockquote></blockquote><p>These words summarised both the regard in which Andreasen was held by the community and the way in which he exemplified the major contribution made to the Islands over the years by the many sailors, particularly of Scandinavian origin, who, by 'accident or hazard' found themselves on Falklands shores. Emily Andreasen died in 1978 and she and her husband are buried in Stanley cemetery. Chris Andreasen's grave, with his country's flag painted on the stone, is still sought out by visiting Danish mariners to whom his name has become something of a legend.</p>",

        "body": "<p>admiral, was born on 23 April 1697, the younger son of William Anson of Shugborough Park, Staffordshire. He joined the navy in 1712, became post captain in 1724, and on the outbreak of war with Spain in 1739 was appointed as commodore to take a powerful naval squadron to the South Seas. There seemed nothing in his years of peacetime service, many of them spent in trade protection duties, to single out Anson for this task. Connection may provide an answer, for there is evidence that he already had as patron the powerful figure of the Lord Chancellor, Lord Hardwicke, whose daughter he was to marry in 1748. The voyage round the world (1740-44) brought this little-known officer fame, wealth and promotion. In many ways the voyage was a disastrous venture, with huge losses of ships and men, but it was redeemed by Anson's capture of the Acapulco treasure galleon off the Philippines in 1743. On his return home Anson was fêted as a hero in the mould of Drake, and the official account of his voyage was eagerly awaited. When it was published in 1748, <em>A Voyage Round the World...by George Anson </em>became a best-seller. Its first edition attracted more than 1800 advance subscribers, and it went through four further editions before the end of the year.</p><p>Although the actual writing of the official account seems to have been shared between Richard Walter, the chaplain on the voyage, and the pamphleteer Benjamin Robins, there can be no doubt that the views it expressed were of the squadron's commander, by now Baron Anson of Soberton after his victory over the French fleet at the Battle of Cape Finisterre in May 1747, Admiral of the Blue, and a Lord of the Admiralty. Chapter IX, 'Observations and directions for facilitating the passage of our future Cruisers round Cape Horn', is of particular interest. In it the writer explained that there were two main reasons for the expedition's early problems. The ships had left England too late in the year for the passage around Cape Horn, and they lacked a suitable port of call for refreshments and repair in the South Atlantic. The squadron had called at St Catherine's {Isla de Santa Catarina} off the coast of Brazil, but had found little in the way of fresh provisions or hospitality there, and Anson suspected that its Portuguese governor was passing information to the Spaniards at Buenos Aires. One way of avoiding these obstacles was to find unclaimed territory farther south. Two possibilities were mentioned. One was Pepys Island, allegedly discovered in 1684 by the buccaneer Ambrose Cowley in latitude 47°S. No land exists in that latitude, although this was not known at the time when the account of Anson's voyage was published. The other possibility was the Falklands Islands, 'seen by many ships both <em>French </em>and <em>English </em>' in about latitude 51°S. Among the latter was the privateer Woodes <a href=\"/biographies/rogers_woodes\">ROGERS</a> who, although he did not land, described the northeast coast in promising terms: 'All this Land appear'd with gentle Descents from Hill to Hill, and seem'd to be good Ground, with Woods and Harbours.' The account suggested that both Pepys Island and the Falklands should be surveyed, but the writer was clearly in favour of the latter because it was nearer Cape Horn and Rogers had sailed from there to Juan Fernandez in the South Sea in thirty-five days. To acquire such a base, the Anson account continued, 'even in time of peace, might be of great consequence to this Nation; and, in time of war, would make us masters of those seas.'</p><p>In the months following the publication of the account of his voyage in May 1748 Anson used his position on the Board of Admiralty to urge a new expedition. In January 1749 he reported that the king had agreed that two sloops should be 'sent on Discoverys in the Southern Latitude'. By the end of February the sloops had been chosen, and during March and April they were altered in preparation for the voyage, with John Campbell (who had sailed with Anson on his circumnavigation) in command. He was to survey both Pepys Island and the Falklands before sailing round Cape Horn and into the South Sea where he was to water at Juan Fernández. It was a peacetime re-run, with modifications, of the Anson voyage, and the Spanish government was predictably alarmed by reports of the proposed venture. In response to Spanish protests the secretary of state for the Southern Department, the Duke of Bedford, offered to abandon the Pacific part of the voyage, and stressed that the expedition would limit its activity at Pepys Island and the Falklands to survey work - 'there is no intention of making any Settlement in either'. The Spanish foreign minister, Don Joseph de Carvajal, was far from reassured by these concessions, warning that 'neither He nor any one else could be stranger to the Rise and Intent of such an Expedition, since it was so fully explained in the printed Relation of Lord Anson's Voyage.' He went on to express doubts about British intentions as far as Pepys Island and the Falklands were concerned, which Bedford reported in the following terms: 'If We did not intend to make any Establishment there, What Service could this bare knowledge be of to us?' In June 1749 British ministers, anxious not to upset diplomatic negotiations with Spain on other issues, ordered the Admiralty to drop the entire expedition, although with the caveat that 'His Ma[jes]ty cannot in any respect give into the reasonings of the Spanish Ministers, as his right to send out Ships for the discovery of unknown &amp; unsettled Parts of the World, must indubitably be allowed by every body.'</p><p>In the event there was no discovery voyage from Britain into southern latitudes until 1764, when Commodore John <a href=\"/biographies/byron_john\">BYRON</a> sailed for the Falklands and the Pacific. Byron's voyage was the abortive 1749 expedition writ large, and its aims were similar to those pressed by Anson at the time. Anson himself, First Lord of the Admiralty since 1751 save for one brief interlude, died in office on 6 June 1762. Lady Anson had died the year before, and as they had no children the title became extinct. Anson had died in the midst of another war with Spain, still regretting (a ministerial colleague recorded) that he had not secured a settlement in the Falklands. Although George Anson never visited the Falkland Islands he was responsible for setting off a chain of events that eventually resulted in Commodore Byron's voyage to the islands in 1764 and the first British settlement there soon after.</p><p>Port Louis was briefly renamed Anson by Governor Moody in the 1840s and the name was also given to the experimental farm opened by government in the 1920s.</p>",

        "body": "<p>governor, was born on 23 May 1909, the son of Reverend Edwin Arrowsmith and his wife Kathleen Eggleston, née Porter. He married Clondagh, eldest daughter of Dr WG Connor, in 1936. They had two daughters, Susan who married a naval officer she met in the Falkland Islands, and Jennefer. Educated at Cheltenham College and Trinity College Oxford, in 1932 he followed the strong Cheltonian tradition of public service by entering the colonial service as assistant district commissioner, Bechuanaland Protectorate. He then held various district posts from 1933 to 1938. Progressing from commissioner Turks and Caicos Islands 1940 to 1946, administrator Dominica 1946 to 1952 and resident commissioner Basutoland 1952 to 1956, he became governor of the Falkland Islands 1957 to 1964 and was additionally high commissioner British Antarctic Territory 1962 to 1964. Cheltenham College has the unique distinction of providing three post-war governors of the Falkland Islands, the other two being Sir Edwin's successor Sir Cosmo <a href=\"/biographies/haskard_cosmo\">HASKARD</a> and William Fullerton.</p><p>His was an inspired appointment as governor but then his service background and training in the various parts of the Commonwealth made him ideal for the post. It is a measure of his success and popularity that he served such an exceptionally long period in the Islands. He was probably the first governor to talk with Islanders instead of at them. A commanding figure supported by a highly popular family, he participated naturally in the social life of this close community whilst retaining the dignity of office. Approachable at all times he achieved success because he listened to people and made up his own mind regardless of past prejudices. An instance of this which brought considerable financial benefit to the Islands was his acceptance, in the face of some scepticism and opposition from officials, of proposals from the United Kingdom based companies led by the Falkland Islands Company. These proposals involved the replacement of indirect taxes which the overseas companies were unable to set off against their British tax liability with a much higher corporate direct tax of around the British level. This resulted in substantial diversion of tax from the UK to the Islands. Earlier, following the outbreak of the Korean War, wool prices had soared but much of the benefit had been lost to the Colony because the overall tax rate of the Falkland Islands Company, for example of 66 per cent, was shared 48½ per cent UK and 17½ per cent Falkland Islands. The legislation was introduced in such a way that locally-registered companies were largely unaffected.</p><p>Arrowsmith was a keen fly fisherman and introduced freshwater fish to the Islands to establish fishing as a sport. He was also a firm supporter of all sporting activities in the Islands and no game of football or cricket would be played without his presence and support. Although the 50th Anniversary of the Battle of the Falkland Islands fell just after his governorship, Arrowsmith undertook the preliminary work. He set out to trace survivors of the battle and located no fewer than 237 officers and men initially and some more later on. Each survivor was presented with a suitable memento including a set of the commemorative stamps issued by the Islands to mark the occasion.</p><p>Following his departure from the Falkland Islands, 'Arrow', as he was popularly known, became director of the Overseas Services Resettlement Bureau where he made a great success of finding appropriate employment for colonial service officers whose careers had been cut short by decolonisation. He was also regularly invited to 'meet and greet' visiting VIPs, a role for which his unfailing good humour, tact and charm were ideally suited. Outside his service roles he was dedicated to helping the blind, being a member of the council of St Dunstan's for 28 years and for 15 years chairman of the Royal Commonwealth Society for the Blind and later vice-president. A fervent supporter of Cheltenham College, Arrowsmith was president of the Cheltonian Society 1968/1969 during its centenary year. He also strongly supported the Falkland Islands during the difficult years of the late 1960s, becoming a vice-president of the Falkland Islands Association and regularly attending committee meetings until his death on 10 July 1992.</p>",

        "body": "<p>governor, was born on 16 December 1905 in Poonah {Pune}, India, son of Sigismund and Constance Arthur. His father was a member of the Indian Civil Service. He was educated at Charterhouse and Corpus Christi College, Cambridge. He joined the Nigerian Political Service in 1928, serving there till 1937 when he was transferred to the district administration in Cyprus, the first of three island postings. He became chief commissioner (head of the district administration) in 1948, and governor's deputy in 1950<em>.  </em>In 1952 he was appointed colonial secretary, Bermuda, whence he was appointed to the Falklands.</p><p>Governor Arthur's time in the Islands from 1954 to 1957 predated the era of Argentine pressure which did not begin effectively till 1964. He was spared having to deal with the frequent, seemingly inherent, conflict between the wishes of Islanders and the strategy of the British Government which was to be-devil the governorships of so many of his successors. Yet he still had to fight the Islands' corner with the Colonial Office over what he saw as ill-informed Whitehall views about projects financed by Colonial Development and Welfare Funds, as his private letters (in the Rhodes House Library at Oxford) show. He was especially angry about what he described to LegCo on 17 February 1955 as the 'recklessly planned and extravagantly and inefficiently constructed freezer at Ajax Bay'.</p><p>The Colonial Reports for the years 1954 to 1957 tell of what may now seem to be basic, modest, infrastructural, developments. In 1954 there was the installation of new broadcasting equipment, the opening of the Stanley Infants' School, and the completion of the Darwin Boarding School, largely financed by the Falkland Islands Company to mark their Centenary. In 1955 the new power station was opened. The laying of the concrete main road on the Stanley waterfront began in 1956 and was completed in 1957. Work on the water filtration plant also began in 1956. Work on the important new development of camp tracks began too in Governor Arthur's time. A second Beaver float plane was purchased, though thoughts which he harboured of an air link with Latin America would have to wait.</p><p>His address to the LegCo on 26 October 1954 speaks of the difficulties of recruiting teaching and other professional staff from overseas, as well as artisans and unskilled labour. It describes the extent to which maintenance of buildings had had to be neglected through labour shortages. These problems feature again in his Address to LegCo on 17 February 1955 and on 4 June 1956 he warned LegCo:</p><blockquote><blockquote>The Public Works programme seems to be like the mythical Hydra; as fast as one horrid head is cut off another one grows. Much has been done on the renovation and repair programme of Government buildings but the work has proved to be much more extensive than had been expected.</blockquote></blockquote><p>The Rhodes House letters, not of course written with a view to reputation, reveal a man who appears to have been entirely appropriate to the Falklands of his time. He was a passionate horseman who imported his own horses and rode whenever he had the opportunity, covering much of the Islands on horseback and spending days in the saddle. He even persuaded the non-riding captain of a visiting Royal Navy ship to learn to ride sufficiently well to accompany him in taking the 1954 Queen's Birthday parade mounted. With a very light load of paper work when mails were infrequent and administration relatively simple, he had the time to appreciate the people and the place. He was a natural countryman who from time to time took an active part in sheep gathering, cattle gathering and lamb marking, as well as relishing shooting upland geese. He was an indefatigable party-giver and dispenser of hospitality. He had the capacity to relate to all sorts and conditions of men and women and to judge them shrewdly, sympathetically, and with humour.</p><p>Yet, though he obviously enjoyed himself, he took his responsibilities seriously. At that time the governor was expected to give a strong lead to ExCo which consisted of a combination of officials appointed ex officio and nominated unofficials to whom the four elected members were added to form LegCo. A letter gives the flavour. 'ExCo went very well, and I got through one or two things which they had thrown out before. If you go on and on at a council or legislature you usually get what you want in the end.' He was quick to assert his authority when he felt it was needed. Of one elected councillor he says 'I told him pretty sharply he was talking nonsense and why'. At the same time he encouraged debate, and democracy in LegCo by obliging unofficial members of ExCo to support publicly the decisions which they had reached in private. Essentially he was the very best sort of old-fashioned paternalist colonial administrator.</p><p>His governorship will be especially remembered for the visit of the Duke of <a href=\"/biographies/edinburgh_the\">EDINBURGH</a> from 7-9 January 1957. It appears to have been a great success. In Stanley Prince Philip attended a special race meeting and won the Sailors' Race as well as making the customary school and hospital visits. There was a Colony Ball and a visit to Fox Bay before the Prince departed in the Royal Yacht <em>Britannia </em>for South Georgia, accompanied by Arthur.</p><p>In 1935 Arthur married Mary Elizabeth Spring-Rice, the daughter of Sir Cecil Spring-Rice who was the British ambassador in Washington during World War I. They had one son and one daughter.</p><p>Towards the end of 1956 he was offered the governorship of the much more sophisticated world of the Bahamas. 'I shall be very sorry to leave here,' he wrote on leaving the Falklands. Sadly there are no letters to tell how he coped with his new islands with their population of 100,000 and burgeoning prosperity increasingly founded on luxury tourism and financial services. He was governor there from 1957 till 1960 when he retired, becoming a JP in East Sussex. Unusually he was appointed CVO and CMG in the same year, 1953, and KCMG in 1957. He died on 4 December 1973 following a riding accident.</p>",

In 1841 he was appointed assistant surveyor to the expedition sent to New Zealand under Mr Ligaer and served in that post until 1848. He was then appointed surveyor-general of the Falkland Islands at a salary of £350 and probably arrived with Governor <a href=\"/biographies/rennie_george\">RENNIE</a> on the transport <em>Nautilus </em>in June 1848. A minute from Rennie dated 27 October 1848 expresses disappointment at his inability to construct roads and buildings. In reply Bailey blamed the poor quality of workmen in the colony.</p><p>In the Falklands census of 1851 he is described as married with two children. His wife was Marie-Louise (also spelt Louisa) née Lovelige and they had two daughters, Madeline Jane (b1848) and Agnes who died aged 4 weeks on 24 October 1850. His wife died about two weeks later on 5 November. A despatch from Governor Rennie in 1851 noted that Bailey and his daughter were desolate and he was sent on one year's leave. He married again on 7 April 1868 to Elizabeth, formerly Horrocks. They had seven children in the Falklands, all except three of whom seem to have died in infancy, although the records are not entirely clear. Elizabeth herself died in 1877, aged only 25.</p><p>Governor <a href=\"/biographies/moore_thomas\">MOORE</a> suspended Bailey for discharging a pistol in the settlement and for insulting conduct, but this incident does not appear to have harmed his career.

In 1861 Moore instructed him to use his authority as a JP to sort out a dispute between the lessees of New Island and the captain of a French brig who was illegally slaughtering penguins. The surveyor post was closed in 1873, and Bailey was appointed coroner, registrar-general and receiver of wrecks in 1875 and police magistrate in 1878. He administered the government during Governor CALLAGHAN's leave in 1878. His term was not a success: on his return Callaghan wrote: 'I found that a decided reaction had set in against the recent policy of the government, and this I fear greatly owing to Mr Bailey, who from his long residence here has become too subject to local influences to be able to withstand the strong pressure put upon him'. In July 1879 Callaghan told the Colonial Office that he was unwilling to devolve government on Bailey again.</p><p>He died on 14 September 1883, and was buried in Stanley Cemetery, as were both his wives and four or five of his nine children.

In 1866, at age twenty, together with his younger brother Edward and two Yorkshire men named Stickney, Baillon chartered a sailing vessel and set off for South America to find somewhere to settle. After visiting several places along the coast of South America they acquired 78,332 acres of land at Fox Bay on the island of West Falkland. They lived under their overturned boat while building their first residence, a building that still stands and is used by the Edwards family, current owners of the property, as a tractor shed. Baillon married Mary Julia Isobel Williams, daughter of Charles Henry Williams, a Weddell Island sheep rancher, on 28 March 1876 in the Church of Our Lady Star of the Sea in Stanley. They had fourteen children. The first seven, born in the Falklands, were: Marie Barbe (b1876) Marie Eleanor (b 1878) Alexander Falkland Baillon (b 1880) Louis Charles (b 1881) Catherine (b 1883) Constance Winifred (b 1885) and Mildred Frances (b 1887).

However he obviously maintained some connection with the Falklands as it is noted that, when St Mary's Church in Stanley was blessed in 1899 by Father Patrick O'Grady, it was under the sponsorship of Mr Louis Baillon who had contributed to the church construction. After his return, he was employed by a bank in various places in southern England. Following the death of his wife in 1924 he moved from Teddington in south-west London to Ventnor, Isle of Wight, where he died on 27 January 1926.</p><p>The family's name is always pronounced 'Ballion' in the Islands.</p><p><a href=\"/biographies/terriss_william\">See Image 340</a></p>",

        "body": "<p>chief secretary, eldest child of Stephen Baker and Jessica Wilhelmina, née Clarke, was born on 19 April 1933 at Sheerness, Kent. He was educated at Borden Grammar School and New College Oxford. After national service in the Royal Navy as a sub-lieutenant RNVR, he returned to Oxford in 1957 for the course in overseas administration and was then appointed a cadet administrative officer in the British Solomon Islands Protectorate {Solomon Islands}, in the western Pacific.</p><p>He married Constance Anne Shilling on 22 April 1957: they have two sons, Richard (b1958) and Adrian (b1960), and two daughters, Karen (b1972) and Helen (b1974).</p><p>From 1958 to 1963 Baker served in various posts in the Solomons in district administration, co-operatives development and the Secretariat. For personal reasons he then remained for four years in the UK working in the family farming business. In 1967 he was invited to return to government service in the Western Pacific and spent the following twelve years in administrative posts with the British service in the Condominium of the New Hebrides {Vanuatu}.</p><p>In 1979 he accepted the post of chief secretary to the Falkland Islands Government. Accompanied by his wife and two younger children, Karen and Helen, Baker arrived in Stanley in March 1979 and as lifelong 'islands people' the family soon became very much at home in the Falklands and made many lasting friendships there. At that time every aspect of Falklands life was overshadowed by the Argentine sovereignty claim. One of Baker's first official acts was to witness Governor <a href=\"/biographies/parker_james\">PARKER</a> 's signature to some documents concerning the status of former whaling stations in South Georgia; he noted the Governor's prescient disquiet at possible future Argentine involvement there. (Parker's unease proved well-founded three years later, when Davidoff's involvement in South Georgia was closely followed by the Falklands Conflict).</p><p>The other constant preoccupation at that time was the struggle to maintain the budget in balance and prevent the Colony from sliding into 'grant-maintained' status. There was a need to develop some new economic activity to supplement the traditional wool production. Along with many others, Baker saw fisheries development as the key here and regretted HMG's determination not to allow this or the declaration of any economic zone around the Islands in case this should 'upset the Argentines'. Indeed it was not until 1987, when they had been well and truly 'upset' that this development was allowed, with dramatic results.</p><p>Reform of the system of agricultural land holding was a less frustrating area and one of the few recommendations of Lord SHACKLETON's original Report on which it had been possible to make some progress. The first step in this process, 'The Green Patch Scheme', was just coming to fruition and Baker was happy to be much involved in the further development of this policy. It was clear that means had to be found to satisfy the aspirations of Islanders (and possibly some newcomers) to own and farm their own land, and subdividing some of the larger farms provided a way forward. Progress was made here but there was a serious potential problem of undercapitalisation.</p><p>Manpower was a constant problem and there were always shortages of particular skills. Baker was enthusiastic about the idea of filling some of these job ­vacancies by recruiting workers from St Helena where there was a shortage of employment opportunities. The Conflict prevented implementation of the pilot scheme but soon afterwards it was possible to proceed on quite a large scale and by that time Baker was able to assist from his next post in St Helena.</p><p>The improvement of education facilities was an ongoing aim and the need for a proper secondary system had become pressing. Geography dictated that secondary pupils from Camp should board in Stanley. This was the key to secondary development and the long and frustrating struggle to provide acceptable accommodation was yet another story which did not reach a successful conclusion until after the Conflict.</p><p>During the Argentine invasion on 2 April 1982, at the point when it was decided that negotiations would need to be opened with the Argentine forces, Baker undertook to make the initial contact with the Argentine commander Admiral Busser. He and his family were expelled by the Argentines on 13 April 1982, but returned on 25 June. He was appointed governor and commander in chief of St Helena and its dependencies in 1984 and served until retirement in 1988. Baker was awarded the OBE in 1979 and advanced to CBE in 1984.</p><p>Baker considered himself fortunate with the governors he served under, at first James Parker and then for a rather longer period Rex <a href=\"/biographies/hunt_sir\">HUNT</a>, and also with the very supportive civil service and councillors and the many other friends he made throughout the Islands.</p>",

        "body": " <p>government geologist, was born in London on 16 May 1885, the son of William Baker. Educated in Woolwich, he first trained as a teacher but then entered University College, London, in 1905 to study mathematics, physics and chemistry. There, under the guiding influence of Professor EJ Garwood, his geological interests came to the fore and he graduated with a BSc in geology, second-class honours, in 1908. He joined the London Teaching Service and his nomination in 1910 for membership of the Geological Society of London describes him as a 'teacher interested in continuing the study of geology'. He began researching the deeper geological structure of the London area, utilizing borehole records, and he published two substantial scientific papers on that theme in 1917 and a third in 1918, despite active service during World War I with both the Royal Flying Corps and the Royal Navy. Writing aboard HMS <em>Carysfort </em>in July, 1918, he noted 'I have been continuously on active service, first flying in France and later serving afloat, since 1915', adding sardonically that his geological researches served 'to beguile the tedium of life afloat'. On being demobilized, Baker returned to full-time geological research at Imperial College, London, studying the mechanical properties of sediments and methods for their examination. For this work he was awarded his doctorate in 1920 and published a series of papers describing his results in the same year. Later in 1920 he was appointed government geologist for the Falkland Islands and arrived in Stanley aboard RMS <em>Orita </em>on Christmas Day, 1920. His wife remained behind in London, Baker having arranged that she should receive half of his £600 per annum salary.</p><p>Baker's principal objective in the Falkland Islands was to assess their potential for minerals of economic importance. At the time the broad outline of the Islands' geology had been determined, mainly through the efforts of two scientists accompanying Swedish expeditions to the South Atlantic region - JG <a href=\"/biographies/andersson_johan\">ANDERSSON</a> and TG <a href=\"/biographies/halle_thore\">HALLE</a>. Baker set out to extend that understanding and to produce a comprehensive geological map of the Falklands through a series of horseback traverses across the larger islands, supplemented by coastal boatwork. The scale of his task should not be underestimated. He was faced with a large uncharted area devoid of infrastructure and very sparsely populated. His coastal work was largely opportunistic, determined by the irregular sailing schedules of the coastal steamer, whilst for his inland traverses he was dependent on the goodwill of farm managers and shepherds for accommodation, provision of horses and the transport of specimens. Their support seems to have been unstinting, as Baker acknowledged in his final report:</p><blockquote><blockquote>Station-managers and \"camp\" shepherds alike willingly and gratuitously housed me and fed me for as long as I chose to stay with them, provided horses to meet my needs and either constituted themselves my guides or found others to act in that capacity.</blockquote></blockquote><p>His explorations were carried out in twelve tours, extending through most of two summers and the intervening winter, and it seems unlikely that he spent much time enjoying the comforts of Stanley, though on 28 June 1921 he did find time to entertain the Stanley Literary and Debating Society with 'Musings of a Geologist'.</p><p>Baker's geological work was thorough and comprehensive but several aspects have proved particularly enduring. He visited the outcrop of the oldest, metamorphic, rocks in the islands, the 1,000 million year old Cape Meredith Complex on West Falkland, and produced the first systematic description, noting the similarities with parts of the Cape Province in South Africa. Building on this correlation, he detailed the close association of the overlying Falklands sedimentary succession with the geology of southern Africa, but also demonstrated a broad awareness of contemporary geological work in South America. In placing the Falklands within their regional context he adopted a radical stance, favouring the highly controversial idea of continental drift, then only recently published by Alfred Wegener. Further evidence for this came from Baker's extension of the fossil flora contained in the youngest Falklands sedimentary rocks in Lafonia. In common with his other geological specimens, these plant fossils were sent back to Imperial College, London, and a description of them was presented by Professor AC Seward at a meeting of the Geological Society on 6 December, 1922. Seward named one of the new species discovered by Baker in his honour - <em>Dadoxylon bakeri </em>.</p><p>Despite his considerable scientific success - his geological map was not superceded until 1972 by the work of <a href=\"/biographies/greenway_mary\">GREENWAY</a> - Baker failed to discover economically important minerals in the Falklands. This disappointment, coupled with the arduous and difficult circumstances of his surveying, is reflected in his reports by many comments and asides as, for example, when describing his efforts at photography: 'I carried a plate camera with me and took numerous photographs, but ... riding over such rough country frequently meant disaster to my pictures. Plates innumerable were smashed, and several times the camera itself'. His frustrations show most clearly in the preliminary draft of his final report, a copy of which is held by the Falkland Islands Archive. One telling passage which did not make it into the final 'official' version complains that 'The visible rocks tell the unfortunate geologist nothing fresh, and his common lot is to ride and ride, in driving rain, or shrieking wind, or both, hoping to light upon a rock-exposure in the banks of some uncharted \"arroyo*\".' Baker left Stanley on 2 April 1922 aboard RMS <em>Orcama.  </em>He had carried out the first assessment of the Islands for minerals of economic importance, and compiled the first comprehensive geological map.</p><p>Back home in London, Baker spent some time examining his geological specimens at Imperial College and completing his final report to the Colonial Office. Later in 1922 he moved overseas again, to Grenada in the West Indies, first to become headmaster of the boys' secondary school and then, in the following year, director of education. He continued in this post until 1926 when he returned to geology as director of the Geological Survey of Newfoundland, serving there for three years. In 1929 Baker returned to England, rejoined the London Teaching Service, and resurrected his researches into the deeper geological structure of the London region, publishing a paper on the potential for concealed and undiscovered coalfields in 1935. This proved to be his final published work although he continued teaching until his retirement in 1950. He died at home in Catford, London, on 6 December 1954.</p>",

Sir Henry was successively governor of British Guiana, Jamaica, Victoria {Australia}, Mauritius, and Cape Colony.</p><p>Barkly was educated at Harrow, and was a lieutenant in the 3rd Carabineers from 1862 to 1865. He served as private secretary to his father in Mauritius and Cape Colony, where in 1873, at Government House, Cape Town, he married Fanny Hatchard, daughter of the bishop of Mauritius. In August 1877 he was appointed a resident magistrate in Basutoland {Lesotho}. He took his wife and their two eldest children, Harry and Nancy, with him to Basutoland, where they remained during the Zulu revolt (1878-1879) and the Basuto rebellion (1880). Barkly's leadership and coolness under fire gained him the respect of the Basutos, who called him 'The Lion'. During each of the two major crises, a child was born to the Barklys: Hugh in January 1879 at the time of the massacre of British troops by the Zulus at Isandhlwana, and Gilbert (Bertie) on 20 June 1880 as the rebel Basutos were advancing on their residence at Mafeteng. Under hair-raising circumstances Fanny and the children got away, but Barkly was besieged in Mafeteng until relieved on 19 October 1880 by the Cape Mounted Police, who placed some of their troops under his command, thereafter called 'Barkly's horse'. He fell seriously ill in June 1881 and returned to Britain to convalesce. In November 1881 he was appointed chief civil commissioner of the Seychelles, where their fifth child, Dorothy Maud (Dot), was born in 1883. They remained throughout an epidemic of smallpox, and in autumn 1884 returned to Britain.</p><p>In January 1886, Barkly was appointed lieutenant-governor of the Falklands, as Governor <a href=\"/biographies/kerr_thomas\">KERR</a> had requested sick leave. He travelled alone to the Falklands, arriving on board the Kosmos mail steamer <em>Luxor </em>on 12 February 1886, and took up his post on 4 March 1886, after Governor Kerr had left. His appointment as lieutenant-governor was temporary, on half pay of £500 a year, and he suffered constant financial hardship. During his tenure, another peat slip occurred in Stanley, following the first one of 29 November 1878. The second slip occurred on the night of 2 June 1886, and as Barkly reported in a letter to his father: 'a regular river of half-liquid peat flowed down the mountain, and ran across the very middle of the town into the sea. It has blocked up several streets, touched a house or two... and killed two people.'</p><p>He thereupon initiated extensive drainage works to avoid a repetition of the disaster. He was popular in the Islands, and a special meeting of the Legislative Council on 9 December 1886 voted him an extra £100 a year. He left the Falklands in HMS <em>Ruby </em>on 17 December 1886 after Governor Kerr returned, and was unexpectedly sent back to the Seychelles. This time he took his whole family, and celebrated Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee there on 21 June 1887, but was soon afterwards invalided home for the fourth time in his career (he had convalesced in Australia in 1863 after suffering a 'dangerous attack of congestion of the lungs', and in 1873 had been given a year's leave of absence from his post in Cape Town after an attack of rheumatic fever). He suffered from diabetes.</p><p>In November 1888 he was appointed governor of Heligoland, an island in the North Sea which had been British since it was captured from Denmark in 1807. Secret negotiations with Germany in the spring of 1890 by Lord Salisbury, British prime minister and foreign secretary, resulted in the Anglo-German Agreement of 1 July 1890, under which Britain exchanged Heligoland for large areas of German territory in Africa. The island was ceded to Germany on 9 August 1890, even though it had never been under German rule. Its Frisian-speaking inhabitants, who had been British citizens all their lives, were not consulted about the change, and Barkly himself only learnt of the agreement from the newspapers. The Barklys could do nothing to help the Heligolanders, who became Germans whether they liked it or not. Still in acute financial straits, the Barklys returned to Britain, where he died on a visit to his wife's brother's estate at Stapleford Park, Pontefract, on 27 September 1890, aged only 47. His early death was attributed by his family to 'a broken heart' but his death certificate gives the cause of death as 'coma diabetes'. His death was a severe blow to Sir Henry Barkly, all of whose four sons predeceased him.</p><p>His widow Fanny wrote two books of reminiscences at Hampton Court Palace, where she was granted a 'grace and favour' apartment in 1892 thanks to the personal intervention of Queen Victoria. She resigned her apartment in March 1900 - the other Palace occupants found her and her five children too lively.</p>",

He was educated in Scotland at Pitlochry High School and Thomson's Academy, Dundee. Barlas came out to West Falkland in February 1908 as a travelling schoolteacher before being appointed acting headmaster at the Government School in Stanley in June 1913 for a short period.</p><p>A series of government appointments followed. Beginning on 3 November 1914, he was appointed acting stipendiary magistrate, coroner, deputy receiver of wrecks, deputy collector of customs and postmaster of the South Shetlands Islands. He resided at Deception Island for the 1914-15 austral summer. In April 1915 he was appointed junior clerk in the colonial secretary's office, Stanley. Subsequently in March 1916 he became magistrate and deputy collector of customs, New Island. Although this was his official post until 1919, he was seconded to South Georgia for almost two years and was government representative in the South Orkney Islands for the 1920-21 summer. Barlas also served as Justice of the Peace for the Dependencies from 1919 to 1941. On 1 January 1920 he was appointed deputy magistrate for South Georgia and in January 1922 he received news of Sir Ernest <a href=\"/biographies/shackleton_sir\">SHACKLETON</a>'s death. <em>Quest </em>'s captain, Frank Wild wrote:</p><blockquote><blockquote>I saw Mr. Barlas, the assistant magistrate. It is curious how one notices small things at a time like this. One incident stands out vividly in my memory. At the moment of my telling him he was lighting a cigarette, which he dropped on the tablecloth, where it continued to burn. I remember picking it up for him and placing it where it could do no harm.</blockquote></blockquote><p>During the 1920s he held various interim appointments in Stanley, most notably chief clerk and clerk of councils but also including the governor's private secretary, local auditor and acting colonial postmaster. Once again he served a summer as representative in the South Shetland Islands and Graham Land, resident at Deception Island, for 1927-28. On 27 September 1928 he was officially appointed as the magistrate and deputy postmaster at South Georgia, appointments he held until his untimely death in 1941.</p><p>A regular member of the Falkland Islands Defence Force since 1914, Barlas was appointed officer commanding the scratch force of whalers, British and Norwegian, known as the South Georgia Defence Force with the commissioned rank of lieutenant in 1940. In 1935 he was awarded the King's Silver Jubilee Medal, one of ten people from the Falklands so honoured. In 1941 he was appointed MBE. He solemnised the first marriage in South Georgia, between his postal clerk, Alfred Nelson Jones, and Vera Riches on 24 February 1932. On 2 September 1941 he was killed by a snow slide which pushed him into the sea while he was walking along the track between King Edward Point and Grytviken. He is buried in Grytviken cemetery with a granite Celtic cross over his grave.</p><p>William Barlas or 'Wullie' as he was affectionately known was a keen sportsman, actively participating in football and athletics. He was remembered as an avid cricketer and a particularly good medium-pace bowler. In addition to his love of golf, it seems he was very involved in various theatre productions. His obituary commented on his 'excellent portrayal of Spettigue in the play 'Charlie's Aunt' in Stanley in 1937.' His friends described him as a modest, unassuming man, with kindness always radiating from his spectacled eyes. He was married to Christina Scott Robertson of Pitlochry, Scotland.</p><p>Barlas's memory lives on in Barlas Bank (a small submarine bank one and a half miles south east of Cape Buller, South Georgia), Barlas Channel (in the northern part of Laubeuf Fjord near Adelaide Island) and Cape Barlas (the Cape marking the northern end of Fredriksen Island in the South Orkney Islands).</p>",

In 1928 he married the Hon Diana Helen Kemp and they had three sons and a daughter. He succeeded to the baronetcy in 1932 and lived in the family home of Bradwall Manor near Sandbach in Cheshire. The family business of Thomas Barlow and Brothers was in Malayan rubber and Barlow was a consultant with them and chairman of several rubber plantations. He was director of the Union Bank of Manchester (1932-40) and, following a merger, of the local board of Barclays Bank until 1973. In addition to his close involvement with business associations in the Manchester area, Barlow represented the Eddisbury division of Cheshire in Parliament on behalf of the National Liberal Party. The constituency was divided in 1950, so he moved to become Conservative member for Middleton and Prestwich (Lancs) from 1951 to 1966. His association with the Falklands began in March 1964, when he was appointed to the board of the Falkland Islands Company, followed soon after by an exploratory visit to the Islands.</p><p>The Falklands were at this time coming under intense pressure from Argentina on sovereignty and this was heightened by the merger of the CRO with the Foreign Office which resulted in the transfer of the Falklands desk to the Latin American department. In 1967 secret talks were held which led to a draft memorandum of understanding between Argentina and the Labour government in London. It was the disclosure of this agreement to ExCo in Stanley in February 1968 which led several unofficial councillors to break their oath of secrecy and directly approach members of Parliament in the UK. Other than the Falkland Islands Company, there was no representation of Falklands interests outside Parliament and it was evident that an independent committee needed to be formed at the earliest moment. A meeting was held in London attended by MPs from all parties and the Falkland Islands Emergency Committee was formed, with Barlow unanimously appointed chairman. In addition to all-party representation, it was essential that the Committee must be seen to be independent of commercial pressures, which was difficult because Barlow was a director of the FIC while the Company's secretary and manager (Frank <a href=\"/biographies/mitchell_francis\">MITCHELL)</a> was honorary secretary of the Committee. It is a tribute to Barlow that there was at no time any suggestion of such influence.</p><p>With his family status, business links and his recreations of hunting, polo and shooting, he might well have been considered a typical Conservative MP, but during the Committee's meetings and meetings at the House of Commons the honorary secretary was genuinely surprised by the warm respect and high regard shown to Barlow by MPs of all parties. He continued to be active in Falklands affairs after ceasing to be an MP in 1966 and remained as a director of the FIC until 1972 when the Company lost its independence following takeover by Dundee, Perth &amp; London Securities. Barlow continued as chairman of the Falkland Islands Committee until the early 1980s, representing the Falklands before a parliamentary select committee in 1983. He died on 5 January 1986 and was succeeded by his eldest son, Sir John Kemp Barlow (b1934).</p>",

The  <em>Nanina </em>'s captain was his father Valentine, and among the crew were Barzillai Pearse, Andrew Hunter and Edmund <a href=\"/biographies/fanning_edmund\">FANNING</a>, the wellknown American sealer, who was temporarily out of employment due to the strained relations between the United States and England. On arrival off New Island a shallop* of 10 tons, which had been brought out in frame, was constructed on shore and then sent to the Jason Islands, where a party of ten men were landed on Steeple Jason, with provisions for six weeks. At the beginning of January 1813 the  <em>Hope </em>of New York, Captain Obediah Chase, called at New Island and informed Barnard that the United States had declared war against Great Britain. As a result of this information Barnard recalled his men from Steeple Jason and moved the  <em>Nanina </em>to the head of Port Richards, referred to by Barnard as Barnard's Harbour, where he hoped to be safe from English whalers, who might be issued with letters of marque*.</p><p>Sealing operations were then resumed off West Falkland. The following April Barnard took the shallop to Fox Bay, from where he saw smoke rising from Speedwell Island (Eagle Island to Barnard), in the south-east entrance to Falkland Sound. Barnard made for the island and, when people were sighted on shore, hoisted American colours. Barnard found 44 people on the island, including 13 Royal Marines, eight women and two children, survivors of the 194-ton  <em>Isabella </em>of London which had been wrecked there on 9 February 1813, when on passage from Port Jackson, in New South Wales, to London. Three officers and three men had already set off in the  <em>Isabella </em>'s longboat for South America to seek relief, while another four were away in a second boat searching other islands in the Falklands group.</p><p>Barnard offered to convey the whole party to some port in South America in the  <em>Nanina </em>and a written agreement was drawn up to that effect. But before the agreement was signed Barnard volunteered the information that Great Britain and the United States were at war, adding that he hoped that this fact would make no difference to the friendly relations between the two parties. Some of the British were reluctant, but after some discussion the agreement was duly signed. Barnard then took four of his own crew and 20 of the castaways on board the shallop and set sail on 8 April for the  <em>Nanina,  </em>with the intention of bringing her round to Speedwell Island to embark the rest of the  <em>Isabella </em>' <em>s </em>crew and passengers. In Falkland Sound he found the four of  <em>Isabella </em>'s people who had left in the second boat and took them on board, but bad weather forced him to anchor in Port Edgar, from where he led a party of 18 across the island to the  <em>Nanina </em>. He then returned to the shallop and four days later succeeded in rounding Cape Meredith, only to be forced to take refuge in Port Stephens. After calling at Weddell Island to obtain a supply of geese and hogs, Barnard eventually reached the  <em>Nanina </em>. On 14 May the shallop was sent back to Speedwell Island, to bring back the remaining survivors from the  <em>Isabella </em>plus such cargo or other articles from the wreck as Fanning and Hunter, who had been left there for that purpose, might select. Meanwhile Barnard moved the  <em>Nanina  </em>to his original anchorage off New Island.</p><p><strong>Betrayal and Abandonment</strong></p><p>The prospect of taking such a large party to South America in the  <em>Nanina  </em>made it necessary to lay in a stock of provisions for the voyage. Accordingly, Barnard, Jacob Green, an American coloured man from the  <em>Nanina </em>, Samuel Ansel, Joseph Albrook and James Louder, Englishmen from the  <em>Isabella </em>, went by small boat to Beaver Island on 10 June to obtain some hogs, which were running wild on the island. To their horror, when they returned to New Island, they discovered that the  <em>Nanina </em>had disappeared, leaving nothing behind, not even a message.</p><p>Three days after Barnard set off for Beaver Island the British passengers on board the  <em>Nanina </em>had seized her and got under way. They first made for Beaver Island where a gun was fired to attract Barnard's attention, but with no signs of him they were not prepared to anchor and search the island and so set course for Speedwell Island, leaving Barnard and his companions to <em> </em>their fate. But on arrival at Speedwell Island,  <em>Nanina </em>was made a prize of the British 16 gun brig HMS  <em>Nancy </em>, Lieutenant William D'Aranda.  <em>Isabella </em>'s longboat had succeeded in reaching Buenos Aires and the  <em>Nancy </em>had been sent to her relief. On 10 July D'Aranda sent the shallop to search for Barnard and his companions, but it returned on the 13th without finding them. It seems unlikely that the shallop even reached Beaver Island. On 27 July the two brigs left Speedwell Island with the survivors, the  <em>Nancy </em>bound for Buenos Aires and the  <em>Nanina </em>, under a prize master bound for England. The  <em>Nanina </em>, however, was forced to call at Río de Janeiro for provisions and water, before continuing to London. Here, according to Barnard, D'Aranda had attempted to wrest 'from an unfortunate man his vessel, while in the act of saving many of their subjects from actual starvation'.</p><p><strong>Marooned</strong></p><p>Back in the Falklands the plight of Barnard and his companions was most wretched as it was now the depth of winter. First they attempted to make their way by boat to Speedwell Island, but were forced to turn back. Having abandoned hope of being rescued by the  <em>Nanina </em>or the shallop they made for New Island early in October, as whalers sometimes put in there for water. As it was approaching the time that the albatrosses began to nest, Barnard provided each man with a sealskin bag to collect their eggs. About a week after their return to New Island Barnard's four companions, at the instigation of Ansel, deserted him, taking the boat, almost all his belongings and more importantly his dog, Cent, who was invaluable in catching wild hogs. In their absence Barnard managed to rekindle the fire which they had kept alight since returning to New Island. In this he was greatly assisted by discovering a source of peat on the island. He then began to construct a stone building, covering the roof with seal skins. He also recovered three small potatoes which he planted in the hope that they would produce a crop in due course. In December penguins arrived, making their nests between the albatrosses, enabling Barnard to collect their eggs in large numbers.</p><p>On 17 December 1813 the four erstwhile deserters returned to New Island and were reconciled with Barnard, who had thus been alone for more than two months. They told him that they had returned to the site of the wreck of the  <em>Isabella </em>, but found that every useful article had been destroyed or carried away. From Louder, Barnard learned that Ansel had tyrannised the other three and so it was resolved to banish him from New Island. On 29 December, while Barnard remained on New Island, the remaining four took the boat across to Weddell Island ostensibly to obtain hogs, and marooned Ansel there. The remaining three then returned to New Island, after spending three days on Beaver Island. A few days later, with Barnard's consent, the three set off once again for the wreck of the  <em>Isabella </em>, returning on 26 January 1814 with many useful articles. Barnard and his three companions then set off for Sea-dog Island, situated about half a mile north-west of Cape Orford, for fur seal skins. On the way they stopped at Weddell Island to drop off Ansel's share of seal skins and his belongings. Ansel fell on his knees, entreating them to take him off, which they eventually did with considerable reluctance. After visiting Sea-dog Island they returned to New Island where, as winter was approaching, it seemed unlikely that any whalers would call, they completed the house using driftwood and the ribs of a whale. During the winter, whenever supplies were low, they crossed over to Beaver and Staats Islands to hunt for hogs and fur seals. To supplement their provisions, Barnard devised a method of snaring geese.</p><p><strong>Rescue</strong></p><p>By the middle of October the albatrosses had returned, enabling them to lay in a supply of eggs. The following month Barnard, Albrook and Louder went over to Weddell Island for some driftwood and hogs, but were detained there for some days by strong winds. On 26 November Albrook and Barnard set off to climb a hill, but before they could reach the summit they heard Louder cry out. On reaching him, all he could say was 'two ships', which they then could see were standing in for New Island. As soon as the tide allowed the three made their way back to New Island where, at six o'clock that evening, Barnard went on board the British whaler  <em>Indispensable,  </em>Captain William Buckle, who informed Barnard that he had received a letter from the British Admiral at Río de Janeiro, asking him to look out for the castaways, should he put in to any of the islands.</p><p>On 29 November 1814, the two British whalers got under way with Barnard, Louder and Albrook on board the  <em>Indispensable,  </em>and with Green and Ansel on board the  <em>Asp,  </em>Captain John Kenny. The two whalers rounded Cape Horn and worked their way north, killing a number of whales. When off the coast of Peru, Barnard and his two companions left the  <em>Indispensable  </em>in their own boat. Landing not far from Pisco, Barnard went through many adventures before finally reaching his home port of Martha's Vineyard, Mass on 23 October 1816. There can be little doubt that Barnard's patience and resourcefulness kept the party sane during their enforced stay of over 17 months in the Falklands.</p><p>Having recovered from his ordeal, Barnard went to England where he appealed against the judgement of the Prize Court which had declared  <em>Nanina </em>to be a lawful prize. His efforts were successful, and on 5 February 1818 the court restored his ship to him and he was awarded damages.</p><p>During a sealing voyage to the South Shetland Islands in 1821 in the  <em>Charity, </em>Barnard called once again at New Island Harbour where he met James <a href=\"/biographies/weddell_james\">WEDDELL</a>, whose account published in 1825 first drew attention to Barnard's misfortune. On his way back to the United States, 'nearly at the same place where I encountered these British demons' Barnard found a British seaman who had been abandoned by his captain. Barnard took him on board and gave him a passage to New York, where he handed him over to the British Consul. It may have been the publication of Weddell's account in 1825 that encouraged Barnard to publish his  <em>A Narrative of the Sufferings and Adventures of Capt. Charles Barnard </em>in 1829. This gives a lucid and readable account of his misadventures. His book included a chart titled 'Chart of the Falkland Islands as Surveyed by Capt Chs H. Barnard'. Since it includes both East and West Falkland it seems possible that Barnard may have visited the Falklands on several more occasions. Nothing is known of Barnard's final years after he was elected to the Marine Society of New York in 1831.</p>",

        "body": "<p>entrepreneur and politician, was born at San Carlos on 21 April 1896, one of eleven children of Arthur James Barnes, a shepherd and his wife Margaret, née Bonner. As a young man Jack Barnes worked as a foreman for the Public Works Department, busy at that time improving the sanitation and water supply to Stanley and constructing streets. He was also a dedicated member of the FIDF and volunteer fire brigade. In 1924 he imported the first motor lorry into the Falklands, a Ford Model 'T', with which, among other activities, he provided Stanley residents with novelty rides in the back along Ross Road at 6d per head [2½ pence]. Immediately after World War II, together with Ernest Luxton, he operated a construction gang which mainly specialised in jetty construction. The majority of farms had their jetties renewed or renovated under the supervision of Jack and Lucky and other work included the complete reconstruction and lengthening of the FIC East Jetty in 1956 and the laying out and construction of Crozier Place.</p><p>Barnes was very active politically. He was a founder member of the Falkland Islands Reform League in 1920 and the moving spirit behind the Labour Federation (later to become the General Employees Union) in 1943. He was a very hands-on, no-nonsense individual, who loved debate and discussion on any subject. He was always a champion of the underprivileged and those in need. He was a keen gardener, as the neat appearance of his property at 2 Dairy Paddock Road demonstrated. His workforce were always mimicking him behind his back with his custom of beginning sentences 'Ho, ho, I think what...' His only bad habit was to chew tobacco which he spat out, much to the disgust of his workmates.</p><p>Jack Barnes married Winifred Anne Carey in 1930. She died in 1945 and in 1950 he married Jack King's widow, Mabel Annie King (née Sarney). There were no children of either marriage. Apart from holidaying overseas a few times and travelling to study labour relations, he was to spend his entire life in the Falklands. He was a highly thought of and respected member of the community, who had the courage of his own convictions and was known for his hard work and concern for others. He died in Stanley on 6 June 1965 and is buried in Stanley Cemetery.</p>",

The second and subsequent children were born on Keppel Island. (Ellen married Henry Edward Adams in 1881, Emma married Herbert Stanley Felton in 1882 and Annie married Charles Felton in 1885, all at the Mission Church on Keppel.)</p><p>The Bartletts were members of the <a href=\"/biographies/despard_george\">DESPARD</a> party that came out to the Keppel Island Mission in 1856 on board the <em>Hydaspes </em>. With his background, Bartlett was given responsibility on Keppel, at first as agriculturist and herdsman, then for general farming activities and later on for the buildings. He was the one who taught cultivation skills to successive generations of Indians to take back to Tierra del Fuego. Under his leadership, too, the farm became profitable, sending its produce to Stanley for sale, and so making the Mission less dependent on funds from England. Bartlett's steady character meant that when the Mission was left without a superintendent by the departure of Despard in 1861, it was he who was left in charge, with Thomas <a href=\"/biographies/bridges_thomas\">BRIDGES</a> assisting him, until the arrival of Waite <a href=\"/biographies/stirling_waite\">STIRLING</a> 15 months later.

        "body": "<p>manager and councillor, was born in London on 8 May 1901, the third son of the Rev John Bernard Barton and Susan Theresa Barton, née Thornton, in a family of seven. He was educated at Haileybury. He was offered employment in the Falkland Islands by CGA Anson, an Old Haileyburian, to work as a cadet at Chartres, and arrived in RMS <em>Orita </em>on October 19 1921. In a letter written fifty years later he records how he landed almost penniless having used the £5 given by his father to tip the stewards. When he arrived, Will Luxton, Anson's partner, had no knowledge of his appointment. However he settled in quickly; nearly fifty years later he was still helping his son David lamb-marking at Teal Inlet. In a letter to Bernard his elder brother he wrote: 'I always enjoy marking, up at crack of dawn and 12 to 15 hours in the open, quite often in hellish weather. You can think of me drinking scalding tea surrounded by lambs' tails and snippets from their ears'. In 1923 TG <a href=\"/biographies/slaughter_thomas\">SLAUGHTER</a>, colonial manager of FIC in a letter to Head Office recommended him as assistant manager at North Arm. 'He has had two years experience and is I hear a very capable hardworking man and very highly spoken of by Mr Luxton'. He was appointed in the same year and spent three years in the 'unique solitudes of Lafonia'. Three years later he became manager of Dean Brothers' property of Pebble Island, Keppel and other smaller islands. It also included Grand and Steeple Jason Islands for which he had a particular affection. In 1927 he married Dorothy Iowa Felton whose parents were George (Jack) <a href=\"/biographies/felton_george\">FELTON</a> and Winifred, née Rowen. During the seventeen happy years he spent at Pebble their two sons were born, David (1929), and Michael (1934). In 1931 he was appointed JP.</p><p>In 1943 the Barton family moved to Teal Inlet, the Felton property, but after seven years Barton was appointed colonial manager of the Falkland Islands Company, a post he held for fourteen years, with responsibilities affecting not only the widespread Company estates but also every aspect of farm supply, shipping and general trading. In 1947 he became a member of LegCo and of ExCo on which he remained until 1974, a unique achievement. During this period he was awarded the Coronation medal, and the OBE followed by the CBE in 1955. He was made a Chevalier (first class) of the Norwegian Order of St Olav in 1959, in recognition of his consular services to the Norwegian Government. In 1957 he served on the Royal Visit Committee responsible for the arrangements to receive the Duke of <a href=\"/biographies/edinburgh_the\">EDINBURGH</a>, and Barton was the principal host on two occasions, for the sheep dog displays and at the racecourse. Barton was chairman of the Stanley Sports Association for twenty five years, chairman of the Sheepowners' Association, chairman of the Horticultural Society and director or chairman of six private farming companies.</p><p>Barton served under five governors, <a href=\"/biographies/clifford_sir\">CLIFFORD</a>, <a href=\"/biographies/arthur_sir\">ARTHUR</a>, <a href=\"/biographies/arrowsmith_sir\">ARROWSMITH</a>, <a href=\"/biographies/haskard_cosmo\">HASKARD</a> and <a href=\"/biographies/lewis_ernest\">LEWIS</a>, all of whom valued his experience and advice. They found that he had strong views which he did not hesitate to express but he had the welfare of the whole colony at heart and his firmness was tempered by a well developed sense of humour which was never expressed at the expense of other people. He believed that the most significant internal event during his period on ExCo was the introduction of the Falkland Islands Government Air Service in 1949. In October 1966 a DC 4 of Aerolineas Argentinas on an internal flight in Argentina was hijacked by the <a href=\"/biographies/condor_group\">CONDOR</a> group and with little fuel left landed on the Stanley racecourse. The Governor was away and Les <a href=\"/biographies/gleadell_leslie\">GLEADELL</a> the colonial treasurer and acting governor immediately consulted Barton. During the following days Barton, who was an excellent broadcaster and regularly interviewed visitors to the Islands, gave a series of five broadcasts which kept everyone informed. This concluded with a commentary from the broadcasting hut at the Stanley racecourse when the empty aircraft piloted by Ernesto Garcia made a successful takeoff.</p><p>In February 1968 Governor <a href=\"/biographies/haskard_cosmo\">HASKARD</a> returned from a special visit to the UK to inform ExCo that a Memorandum of Understanding had been reached between the officials of the Argentine and British Governments relating to the sovereignty of the Falkland Islands. The four unofficial members of Council, led by Barton, broke their oath of secrecy to make a direct appeal in writing to every Member of Parliament, drawing their attention to what was happening. Barton then went to the UK to face a gruelling period of political action and media coverage, supported by an Emergency Committee set up in March and comprising Members of Parliament of all parties and Falkland supporters. The outcry in Parliament resulted in a pledge that no transfer of sovereignty would take place against the wishes of the Islanders. This was a major achievement because early assurances were in respect of the 'interests' of the Islanders. It was also promised that a minister would visit the Islands and in November 1968 Lord <a href=\"/biographies/chalfont_alun\">CHALFONT</a> duly came. Later in 1968 'Barty', as he was affectionately known, took a positive view. A letter written to his brother Bernard illustrates many of his qualities:</p><blockquote><blockquote>All our efforts have been directed towards keeping the Falklands British and we have succeeded so far. What a battle of words and interpretations of same it has been! Far be it from me to praise Harold's [Wilson] administration, for it was he who started the rot 2 years ago when he agreed to discuss sovereignty, but in retrospect it seems as if Lord Chalfont was sincere during his visit here. I have read Hansard for 11th to 13th Dec. and both he and Mr <a href=\"/biographies/stewart_robert\">STEWART</a> spoke the whole truth and nothing but the truth. The ministerial visit was well worthwhile and should have taken place years ago. Lord C is a remarkable clever man, never ruffled, never pompous or boring. No wonder the Guardian correspondent wrote '...Even the terrible old gang of sheep-owners who have misruled the colony for years had to admit that they more than met their match, prompting the irreverent thought that if they are going to be sold down the river, they would prefer it to be done by a Lord'!!...I used some pretty harsh words across the Council table to Lord C for which I apologised profusely presently but he took it all in good heart and he got the message which was the main thing.</blockquote></blockquote><p>In Chalfont's report to the Cabinet in London he described Barton as representing the right wing of ExCo and its most experienced member, enjoying great prestige in the Colony. He added that Barton 'is able but irredeemably reactionary'. Chalfont faced a hostile reception upon his return. He has since disclosed that the Cabinet was then in favour of ending the sovereignty dispute with Argentina, so Barton played a crucial role in ensuring the Islanders have the freedom that they enjoy today.</p><p>Barton retired from service on ExCo in January 1974 and died on July 13. Christ Church Cathedral where the Bartons had worshipped regularly was filled to overflowing for the funeral, for Barton was held in great affection and respect by all those who knew him and Governor Lewis recorded ' the Colony stood still'.</p>",

His father had a tailoring business in the suburb of Eastleigh and Baseley received his primary schooling at a preparatory school in Swanage, later going on to Victoria College in Jersey where his parents had retired. On leaving school he trained as a marine engineer and attained the qualification of a Member of the Institute of Marine Engineering (MIME). He had a variety of seafaring appointments and for a time was engineer in charge of the Padstow lifeboat which was then powered by steam.</p><p>In 1904, he married Edith Mary Clayton, daughter of a Liverpool art dealer, and in 1905 their first child, Victoria, was born; she was later to marry Jack <a href=\"/biographies/bonner_john1\">BONNER</a> of San Carlos.</p><p>In 1907 he was appointed marine superintendent for the Falkland Islands Company in Stanley. His first commission for the Company was to be engineer on the schooner <em>Malvina, </em>which had to be delivered from Liverpool to the Falklands. <em>Malvina </em>was an auxiliary schooner built by Ferguson and Connagh in Liverpool to a Mersey pilot boat design and fitted with a Gardner oil engine operating a twin-bladed propeller giving the vessel a service speed of five knots. She was one of the first vessels to be fitted with auxiliary propulsion of this type. They sailed from Liverpool on 7 March 1907 and had a good passage until 23 April, when, more or less opposite the River Plate, they encountered a south-westerly storm which blew them approximately 1000 miles off course in a northerly direction. There was then a long haul southwards to the Falklands, which they finally reached on 9 June. Though well off most shipping routes they were fortunate to pass one vessel which was able to report their position and allay anxiety as to their whereabouts. <em>Malvina </em>sadly only sailed for about two years in Falkland waters, being wrecked on Reef Island in May 1910.</p><p>After this epic voyage, Baseley returned to England to bring his family out to Stanley, and the names of Mr and Mrs Baseley and infant are recorded in the passenger list of RMS <em>Ortega </em>arriving in Stanley on 18 December 1907. He was marine superintendent for the FIC until the end of 1911. In January 1912 he was appointed by Governor <a href=\"/biographies/allardyce_sir\">ALLARDYCE</a> to the position of colonial engineer, a post he was to hold until his retirement in 1928. As such he was responsible for overseeing the erection of the Naval Wireless Station at Moody Brook and the Government Wireless Station at Fox Bay, both in 1913. He also was in charge of building the King Edward VII Memorial Hospital, which opened in 1915, and the Town Hall in 1916. Both buildings have since been destroyed by fire, the Town Hall in 1944 and the Hospital in 1984. After the end of World War I in 1918 an extensive programme of public works was started which included an improved water supply, modern drainage and sewage disposal, improved roads and electric lighting. A deeply religious man, he served on the Cathedral Select Vestry from May 1908 until 1928, acting as secretary in 1910 and treasurer from 1913 to 1922. He was engineer to the Stanley Fire Brigade and active in the various sporting clubs in Stanley at the time, particularly the football and cricket clubs. The Baseleys had two more children while living in Stanley, Reginald Harold (b1908) and Bruce Falkland (b1915). They retired to England in 1928 and settled in the village of Wraysbury near Windsor, where they continued their involvement in church affairs. They moved to Worthing in 1951 and Edith Baseley died later that year. Baseley died on 27 May 1952.</p>",

        "body": "<p>ship's captain, was born in 1827, the son of Henry Beaglehole, mariner and Ann Beaglehole, née Tippett, of Dartmouth. He married Mary Ann Ford at St Petrox church, Dartmouth on 4 April 1849. He and his family lived at Dartmouth and he followed his father's calling. In June 1869 he was appointed master of the <em>Jhelum  </em>for a voyage from Cardiff, probably with a cargo of coal for Rosario, Argentina.</p><p>His command was a wooden three-masted barque of 466 tons built at Liverpool in 1849 for the East India trade and owned since 10 June 1869 by William Widdicombe of Liverpool. She sailed on 30 June 1869 and had to put into Río de Janeiro on 29 September, leaking. She finally arrived at Rosario, Argentina, on 18 November not before she was involved in a collision. After discharging her cargo she left in ballast on 8 March 1870 bound for the Guanape Islands off Peru to load guano. She eventually sailed for home on 12 July and arrived at Stanley on 18 August 1870 leaky and in distress.</p><p>The <em>Jhelum  </em>was one of eight vessels which entered Stanley harbour through stress of weather, which prompted Governor <a href=\"/biographies/darcy_george\">D'ARCY</a> to report to London that 'this Harbour of Refuge has been of the greatest utility to the Imperial Merchant Marine'. The <em>Jhelum  </em>however was to prove a problem to her master and the Falklands administration. Beaglehole did not have the funds to pay for repairs and indeed there was doubt as to whether the ship was fit to complete her voyage. He was obliged to stay at Stanley from August 1870 until May the following year. Without funds to refit the <em>Jhelum  </em>and without any response from the ship's owner, Beaglehole was obliged to discharge all but four of his crew. Those dismissed became distressed British seamen and a charge on the local administration until they could be repatriated. Several surveys were carried out of her condition but their results were disputed and the ship remained at anchor and unrepaired. His situation had become desperate by February 1871. FE <a href=\"/biographies/cobb_frederick\">COBB</a>, the Falkland Island Company's local manager decided (after advancing Beaglehole £106 15s) that he was a bad risk and cut off his credit.</p><p>On 24 February, HMS <em>Galatea </em>commanded by Prince <a href=\"/biographies/alfred_ernest\">ALFRED</a>, Duke of Edinburgh, arrived at Stanley and four days later Beaglehole wrote to Henry Byng, the Falklands' colonial secretary and shipping master: 'Situated as I am without any means to release my ship from her liabilities or food for my mate and self, Captain Scales [a surveyor acting on behalf of Lloyds of London] prohibiting the sale of the ship after six surveys proving her unseaworthy, will you kindly oblige in assisting me by appointing if possible a survey by some efficient officers of the <em>Galatea  </em>to prove whether or not the ship is in a fit state to proceed on her voyage'. The request was granted and the vessel condemned as unseaworthy. However, Beaglehole was not immediately released from his charge because neither FE Cobb of the FIC nor JM <a href=\"/biographies/dean_john1\">DEAN</a> wished to act as the ship's agents. The Governor reluctantly agreed to take charge in the interim so that Beaglehole could return to England to try and sort matters out with his owners. Beaglehole took passage on HMS <em>Charybdis  </em>at the end of May 1871. JM Dean later agreed to hold power of attorney for Beaglehole and seems to have sold the ship to Packe Brothers for use as a storage hulk in 1874. Cobb never received payment for Beaglehole's debt, but received a payment of £32 and sixpence from M Dean which appears to be the sale price of the <em>Jhelum. </em></p><p>It is unclear how Beaglehole spent his time in the Falklands. Presumably, he and the rump of his crew continued to live aboard the vessel and did what they could towards her upkeep. Whether he had any social life ashore is unclear. On one occasion (10 December 1870), he subscribed five shillings to an appeal for the All Saints' Sisterhood to nurse the sick and wounded on the battlefield (presumably of the Franco-Prussian war). On 18 February 1871, he assisted Captain Scales and JM Dean at the request of FE Cobb as Lloyds' Agent to survey goods recovered from the wreck of the French ship <em>Antonia  </em>which had been recovered by the schooner <em>Lotus.  </em>When he left in May 1871, his contribution to the history of the Falklands ended.

        "body": " <p>colonial secretary, was born on 25 January 1888 at Stirling Castle, Scotland, the elder son of Major Alexander Beattie. He enlisted in the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders in 1906. After service in India and Aden he was seconded to the Royal West African Frontier Force in 1911, and he served in the Nigerian Regiment. During World War I he served on the Nigerian frontier with German Cameroon. He was severely wounded in 1915 and awarded the Military Cross. On the completion of hostilities Beattie served in Nigeria, Sierra Leone, the Gold Coast {Ghana} and the Gambia, leaving the Army in 1922. He then joined the Colonial Service and went to Gibraltar as an assistant colonial secretary.</p><p>In 1925 he was appointed colonial secretary in the Falkland Islands and arrived in October towards the end of the term of office of Governor <a href=\"/biographies/middleton_sir\">MIDDLETON</a>. During his short tenure of office he was involved in one of the most significant events in the history of sheep farming in the Falkland Islands. Beattie was appointed acting governor during the interregnum between Governor Middleton and Governor <a href=\"/biographies/hodson_sir\">HODSON</a>, and while serving as acting governor, presided at the festivities which accompanied the unveiling of the 1914 Battle Monument. Middleton and Beattie had great respect for each other and a happy working relationship. Beattie shared his chief's views on the future of the farming industry. Middleton had encouraged and promoted the research work of Hugh <a href=\"/biographies/munro_hugh\">MUNRO</a>, a senior stock inspector from the Department of Agriculture in New Zealand. Munro's Report (which was published in 1924) was the first truly systematic examination of the condition of the natural resources of the Falklands, and how they might be more effectively managed and exploited. A principal recommendation of the Munro Report was the establishment of an experimental farm, and Beattie was closely involved in the implementation of Munro's proposals. Shortly after the experimental farm was established at Green Patch, Governor Middleton was succeeded by Governor Hodson.</p><p>Within a few weeks of his arrival in the Falkland Islands, after a brief tour of some farms in East Falkland Island, Hodson began a sustained campaign to close down the experimental farm. Colonial Office records show that Beattie strongly disagreed with the new governor's opinions. In a confidential despatch to the Colonial Office he wrote:</p><blockquote><blockquote>the Governor made his tour of East Falkland at a time of year when no sheep work was being done, when the ground was probably under snow, and during the absence of the two leading farmers of the Islands. The only unofficial member of the Council at present in the Colony was the Manager of the FIC, who is not a farmer ... the [Experimental] farm is still in a preparatory state ... lambing and mating of the imported sheep has not taken place yet ... the farm was not expected to become self-supporting ... it is right that the Land Sales Fund should bear the cost of the little agricultural and pastoral research work the Colony carries out ... In the Falkland Islands farmers are extremely jealous of each other; in fact in many cases they are completely antagonistic.</blockquote></blockquote><p>In a private and confidential letter to the Colonial Office Beattie heavily criticised the attitudes and opinions of both the governor and the leading local farmers. He also criticised the governor's compliance with the additional suggestion, made by some local farmers, that the post of chief inspector of stock, and the Stock Department, be abolished. Beattie agreed that the current holder of the post was very unsatisfactory - but maintained that the <em>position </em>was an 'absolute necessity'. The cause of the Governor's concern about the stock inspector and the Stock Department was an outbreak of dog distemper, for which the Governor held the stock inspector responsible. The Colonial Office was astonished by the Governor's opinions and its reply to Hodson's view that a stock inspector was a 'useless extravagance' was swift and to the point: 'Your view ... if accepted would justify the abolition of every Agricultural Department in the Empire'. It is clear from various comments and minutes over the years that the Colonial Office regarded Beattie's opinions very highly. In a minute attached to one of Hodson's despatches is the comment:</p><blockquote><blockquote>He [Beattie] has shown excellent judgement and that he is not to be stampeded into hasty and unwise action in a difficult position. Whereas the new Governor [Hodson] appears to have ignored the Secretary of State's advice to 'go slow' ... Hodson made ... innumerable proposals for change ... after a few weeks in the Colony recommended that the farm be closed ... Should an experimental farm ever be expected to be self-supporting? ... Mr Hodson's experience of sheep farming appears to be restricted to working on a farm in Australia. If you do not think that Mr Hodson is right in his present recommendation and his judgement cannot be trusted in a small matter of this kind, ought he be allowed to remain in his present position?</blockquote></blockquote><p>Beattie's differences with Governor Hodson proved to be irreconcilable, and within a few months of the latter's arrival in the Falkland Islands, he moved to Cyprus as chief assistant colonial secretary in August 1927. Beattie returned to Gibraltar in 1930 as colonial secretary and he remained in post until 1941. He was then appointed administrator of St. Vincent and the Windward Islands. On his return to England in 1944 he worked in the Colonial Office until he retired in 1947. Beattie was made a CBE in 1920 and he was awarded the CMG in 1933. In 1917 he married Janet Dunbar, and they had two sons. He died at Gibraltar on 15 April 1951 at the age of 63.</p>",

        "body": "<p>farmer, was born on 22 May 1915 at Melmerby near Penrith, Cumberland, the ninth of ten children of tenant farmer James Beaty and his wife Eleanor, née Smith. He won a scholarship to Penrith Grammar School and studied at King's College, Durham University where he obtained a first class degree in Agriculture. After a period as farm bailiff and working for an animal feed firm, he was offered a post as stock inspector in the Colonial Service in the Falkland Islands. This enabled him to marry his fiancée Ada Pinkerton, who thought she was off to a Scottish island. They sailed at the end of August 1939 and spent part of the journey out guarding prisoners and painting the ship grey when war was declared.</p><p>Based in Stanley, the chief duty of stock inspector was to enforce dipping and quarantine regulations which necessitated regular trips round the sheep stations on both East and West Falkland. In wartime Stanley Beaty also encouraged the growing of vegetables on all available land, including the churchyards, a practice which encouraged considerable friendly rivalry between the different denominations, and in developing milk production. His policy of ploughing, growing oat hay and then reseeding with grass overcame winterfeed problems while imported Friesian bulls from New Zealand crossed with local cows produced some excellent milk yields. He was also the nearest the Islands had to a vet at that time.</p><p>After leave in 1945 he accepted an offer from the FIC to manage the remote West Falkland sheep station Port Stephens, available as Charlie <a href=\"/biographies/robertson_charles\">ROBERTSON</a> had moved to Fox Bay when Tom <a href=\"/biographies/gilruth_thomas\">GILRUTH</a> moved to Darwin. This was in response both to his love of the Falklands and to not considering himself 'civil enough to be a civil servant'. He loved the independence and responsibility of camp life and threw himself enthusiastically into the management of this large understocked and under-manned station. He managed to improve productivity by the introduction of cobalt dosing of the flock, following successful trials conducted on the farm. He also experimented with more limited success in later lambing to increase percentages. In 1949 Beaty and his wife successfully reintroduced the popular West Falkland sports meeting. He was an enthusiastic dog handler and imported prize dogs from his family back in Cumberland. He was made a JP in 1950. He left the Falklands with regret in 1953 when his children had to go to boarding school in England. He bought a dairy farm in Somerset where he was very active in the National Farmers' Union, becoming county chairman in 1964. In 1966, leaving the farm in the capable hands of his son Bob, he went to Colombia on a Ministry of Overseas Development project on breeding different breeds of sheep at high altitudes near the equator. Returning home in 1971, he went to Turkey from 1972 to 1980 on a World Bank project to develop their dairy industry. In 1980 he retired to the farm in Somerset, where he was involved in farming with his son up to his death on 22 August 1997, aged 82.</p><p>Beaty maintained a lifelong interest in the Falklands and was always delighted to entertain visiting Kelpers. In his retirement he wrote a book about what he and his wife considered the best years of their lives: <em>Falkland Islands Interlude </em>. They had a daughter Margaret (b1941) and a son Bob (b1943). His wife Ada died in Somerset on 5 August 2001 aged 85.</p>",

        "body": " <p>naval officer, was born on 17 August 1897, son of Colonel FB Bell. He was educated at Marfield Grange in Kent and then at the Royal Naval Colleges in Osborne and Dartmouth. He joined the Navy in 1910 and served as midshipman in HMS  <em>Cumberland </em>and HMS <em>Challenger </em>in the Cameroon Campaign 1914-1915. He served in HMS  <em>Canada </em>in the Grand Fleet at Jutland and then between 1916 and 1923 he specialised in submarines. From 1930 to 1932 he was loaned to the Royal Australian Navy and was promoted commander in 1931. In Melbourne he married Dulcie, the daughter of an architect, Nahum Barnet. In 1933 he qualified for the Staff College and two years later he was appointed commander of the  <em>Repulse. </em></p><p>Bell was promoted captain in 1938 just before the outbreak of World War II and in 1939 was given command of the 8-inch gun cruiser HMS <em>Exeter,  </em>in which he took part in the Battle of the River Plate in December 1939, between ships of the Royal Navy's South American Division and the powerful German pocket-battleship  <em>Graf Spee </em>(Captain Langsdorff) <em>.  </em>On 2 December 1939, the  <em>Exeter </em>and the light cruiser <em>Ajax </em>, Captain Woodhouse, flying the broad pennant of Commodore <a href=\"/biographies/harwood_sir\">HARWOOD</a>, were at anchor in Port Stanley. On hearing intelligence that the  <em>Graf Spee </em>was in the South Atlantic, and anticipating that she would probably target shipping near the River Plate, Harwood sailed to intercept her and to rendezvous with the light cruiser  <em>Achilles </em>. On 13 December, 24 hours after he had made his concentration, the  <em>Graf Spee </em>was sighted. In the ensuing action, one of  <em>Graf Spee </em>'s first salvoes struck the  <em>Exeter </em>'s bridge, killing all but three of her officers. Bell was one of the survivors but was able to continue the action until the  <em>Exeter </em>sustained further damage and was listing heavily. As she had only one turret still in action, Harwood ordered Bell to return to Stanley to effect repairs.  <em>Ajax  </em>and  <em>Achilles </em>continued the action until they too sustained significant damage and dropped out of range. However Langsdorff, mindful of his 36 men killed and 59 wounded, decided to run to Montevideo for repairs. He was only given 72 hours in port by neutral Uruguay and believing that the aircraft carrier  <em>Ark Royal </em>and the battle-cruiser  <em>Renown </em>were waiting for him to emerge, decided to sail with a skeleton crew and scuttled his ship in the approaches to Montevideo on 17 December. Langsdorff committed suicide three days later.</p><p>The British ships returned to the Falklands arriving on the 16 December. The colonial secretary, <a href=\"/biographies/craigie-halkett_montague\">CRAIGIE-HALKETT</a>, had offered the whole resources of the town to the  <em>Exeter,  </em>which arrived with 45 wounded. Bell wrote to him that 'No words can express our relief this morning on at last reaching the sanctuary where we were so sure of our welcome'. The hospital was full of casualties and the Islanders looked after wounded in their own homes. Gifts of eggs, butter, meat and books were provided to the hospital. A funeral took place on 18 December for two of the casualties who had died in Stanley. After the successful repair of his ship Captain Bell wrote to Governor <a href=\"/biographies/henniker_heaton\">HENNIKER HEATON</a> on 18 January 1940:</p><blockquote><blockquote>I would like to place on record our very deep appreciation for all the many kindnesses and acts of generosity that have been bestowed on us by yourself and the people of Stanley and the Falkland Islands.</blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>When we arrived here on December 16th battered and weary nothing was too much trouble for your people.

        "body": "<p>Russian admiral and explorer. (His names have been variously rendered in German, Estonian and Russian; the second appears in his baptismal record.) He was born to a family of German Baltic aristocrats on the Estonian island of Oesel {Saaremaa} at the mouth of the Gulf of Riga. He entered the Imperial Russian navy at the age of ten and as a junior officer served under Adam von Krusenstern during the first Russian circumnavigation of 1802-1806, in the <em>Nadezhda </em>and <em>Neva </em>. These vessels sailed via Cape Horn into the Pacific Ocean to explore its northerly reaches, returning via the Cape of Good Hope to Kronstadt, the naval base at St Petersburg. Bellingshausen himself was recalled from duties in the Black Sea to lead a second circumnavigation thirteen years later, his second in command being Lieutenant Mikhail Lazarev, who had commanded the <em>Suvorov </em>during the round-the-world voyage of 1813-16 and who was appointed captain of the <em>Mirnyy </em>, under Bellingshausen in the <em>Vostok </em>. The expedition was sent by Tsar Alexander I to complement Captain James <a href=\"/biographies/cook_james\">COOK</a>'s second great voyage in the <em>Resolution </em>of 1772-1775. Bellingshausen thus became the second circumnavigator of the Antarctic, following Cook and preceding <a href=\"/biographies/biscoe_john\">BISCOE</a>. The sloops <em>Vostok </em>and <em>Mirnyy </em>were unfortunately badly matched and Bellingshausen's journal often records the need to shorten sail in order for <em>Mirnyy </em>to catch up with her faster consort. Both vessels were copper sheathed, but the <em>Mirnyy </em>appears to have been better strengthened than the <em>Vostok </em>.</p><p>The ships departed from Kronstadt in July 1819 to sail easterward round the world and reached South Georgia at the end of the year, when they proceeded to complete Cook's charting by making a running survey of its inhospitable southern coast. Outlying Annenkov Island, made famous in the narratives of SHACKLETON's boat journey of 1916 in the <em>James Caird </em>, was thus discovered and named after one of the officers. Sailing southeast towards the South Sandwich Islands, Bellingshausen gave Russian names to the more northerly group of these not seen by his predecessor, which he called after the promoter of his voyage, the Marquis of Traversey, minister for naval affairs. Zavadovskiy Island, named after the able first lieutenant of the <em>Vostok </em>, was found to be an active volcano, depicted as such with the other islands by the expedition's artist Paul Mikhailov, in the Atlas of the voyage. By sailing east of the southern islands, Bellingshausen proved that the South Sandwich Islands could not form the tip of an Antarctic continent. It is worth noting that the Russian names of these early and unfrequented discoveries have largely survived. Although his ships must have approached very near to the ice-bound continental coast of what is now Dronning Maud Land, Antarctica, Bellingshausen made no claim to have discovered it, although he is generally recognised as having been the first to see it. Like Captain Cook, the Russian commander left the Southern Ocean at the end of the navigation season for the warm waters of the Pacific. There he refreshed his men and made further surveys among the islands, chiefly the Tuamotus, but spending time in Tahiti, where the expedition's astronomer Ivan Simonov corrected the chronometers at Cook's Point Venus. Bellingshausen devotes many pages to their stay on the island, where he breakfasted with King Pomare and was greatly helped by the missionary Henry Nott.</p><p>The Russians had made a remarkable voyage thus far. They had crossed the Antarctic Circle three times, for the third time in the same latitude and longitude as Captain Cook nearly fifty years earlier. 'Since leaving the South Sandwich Islands', wrote HR Mill, the historian of the Antarctic, 'the Russian ships had kept south of Cook's track and pushed the limits of human knowledge far to the southward of any previous explorer'. This was achieved despite storms, icy rigging, poor visibility and snow-encumbered decks, while navigating from time to time fog-bound, in danger of almost invisible drifting icebergs and heavy pack. Fortunately warm clothing and satisfactory food had been issued by the naval authorities. The crews too were picked men to whose welfare Bellingshausen paid great attention. After their first season in the ice, the expedition was made very welcome by Governor Macquarie in Sydney, where repairs were made to the ships. Bellingshausen wrote an interesting description of the infant colony of New South Wales and of the aboriginal inhabitants whom they met.</p><p>After being refitted in Sydney, the ships sailed south again on 31 October 1820 for Macquarie Island and the icy seas beyond, remaining south of latitude 60°S for just over two months, passing through no less than 145 degrees of longitude. On 24 December they crossed the Antarctic Circle for the fourth time in longitude 164°34'W in the midst of huge icebergs. Sadly most of the pet birds bought in the tropics died in the cold. Still skirting the pack ice, the Antarctic Circle was crossed for the fifth time in longitude 120°W. The expedition's furthest south, latitude 69°52'S, was reached on 1 January 1821, after crossing the Circle for the sixth time in longitude 103°W and avoiding numerous icebergs until stopped by a wall of ice. Following the edge of the pack and sailing eastwards, Peter I Island (Øy) was discovered - the first ever outpost of land found south of the Antarctic Circle, named after Tsar Peter the Great. On 28 January, land of larger extent was sighted in 73°10'W also south of the Circle, which was given the name of the reigning Tsar Alexander I, who had despatched the voyage. On 31 January, the ships crossed the Antarctic Circle northwards in longitude 76°W after sailing within it for two weeks for over 28 degrees of longitude, through the waters of what is now called the Bellingshausen Sea. On 4 February, the ships reached the South Shetlands, then recently discovered (as Bellingshausen had been informed in Sydney by William Smith) and charted by Edward Bransfield and later by James <a href=\"/biographies/weddell_james\">WEDDELL</a>. Despite his careful survey of the chain of rugged snow-clad islands from south to north, which set a new standard for polar charts, and their depiction in his Atlas, the place-names bestowed by Bellingshausen did not survive. It was here that the well-known meeting between the Russian commander and the American sealer, Nathaniel Brown Palmer took place, about which Bellingshausen says very little in his book - mainly of Palmer describing the great numbers of fur seals killed (80,000) since the discovery of the islands. The <em>Vostok </em>and <em>Mirnyy </em>then sailed homeward after completing their circumnavigation off South Georgia, anchoring in Kronstadt on 24 July (old style*) 5 August (new style) 1821. Only three men had been lost during a perilous voyage of discovery of two years duration.</p><p>Bellingshausen's narrative, entitled in English translation, <em>The twofold expedition in the Southern Ocean and the voyage round the world in 1819, 1820 and 1821 . . .  </em>and the fine atlas of charts and views were not published for another decade (St Petersburg, 1831). An abridged German translation of the narrative appeared in Leipzig (1902) and an excellent English one, edited by Professor Frank Debenham for the Hakluyt Society in 1945. The latter contains an introduction and numerous footnotes by the editor, a member of Captain Scott's last expedition, 1910-1913. Of particular relevance to the present work are the fine charts and views of the south-west coast of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands in the Russian Atlas. These and others interleave the English translation, much reduced, the placenames having been translated into English.</p><p>Bellingshausen greatly regretted the absence of naturalists on his voyage. Two Germans had been appointed to join at Copenhagen, but pleaded a lack of time to complete their preparations as an excuse to withdraw. 'Perhaps they were right' commented Bellingshausen 'but I, as a naval officer, cannot help thinking that all that a scientist need bring with him is his scientific knowledge'. He makes many remarks on the birds and other creatures in his narrative and the artist, Mikhailov, produced some very fine pictures of them (and of the scenery and the people) all to be found in the Atlas. The resumption of Russian activity in the Antarctic during the mid-twentieth century led to a renewed interest in Bellinghausen's voyage, including the publication of his charts in 1963 and of an abridgement of the twenty five notebooks kept by the astronomer, Ivan Simonov, in 1951.</p><p>After reading the English translation and studying the Russian Atlas, one feels tremendous admiration for Bellingshausen, his officers and men. They complemented Captain Cook's second great voyage in every respect, competing with it in none. While Bellingshausen may not be called the discoverer of the Antarctic continent, as maintained by certain Soviet historians, he was certainly the first to see it, although not recognising it as such. He became an admiral in 1831. His last appointment was as governor of the Russian naval base of Kronstadt, where he died in 1852.</p>",

        "body": "<p>German colonist, was born in Hamburg, Germany, the son of a family of lawyers. He was to be apprenticed to the family firm, but being an outdoor type left home to seek his fortune, ending up in 1864, at 20 years of age, sealing off Patagonia where a seal bit off two fingers from his right hand. According to some family members, he was put ashore in Stanley to recover, (but another story says that the ship's crew were cruel to him and that he jumped ship and hid in a cave until the ship had left Stanley). The Aliens' Register of 1867 does not list a Bender, so it is likely that he arrived shortly after that date. Whenever it was that Bender fetched up in Stanley, it was in time to make friends with and impress several settlers in the town, probably by his youthful good looks and industrious habits. On 25 June 1875, Governor <a href=\"/biographies/darcy_george\">D'ARCY</a> granted William <a href=\"/biographies/coulson_william\">COULSON</a>, government messenger, a lease for 21 years of 4,000 acres of Crown Land in Moody Valley west of Stanley. The next day Coulson took Bender into partnership, and with their joint capital and some advances from local merchants (Mrs Orissa <a href=\"/biographies/dean_orissa\">DEAN</a> in particular) they stocked the farm with sheep and erected the necessary buildings, at a cost of between £700 and £800. Management was entirely in the hands of Bender, who resided on the farm. Ten months later, on 24 April 1876, Bender with Edward Nilsson, a native of Sweden, swore an Oath of Allegiance to Queen Victoria at a fee of £5, and became the first 'Five Pound Britisher.' Legislation had not been put in place to provide for such a contingency and so on the 11 May 1876, a retrospective Naturalization Ordinance was passed giving Bender (and Nilsson) 'to all intents and purposes whatsoever entitled, within the limits of this Colony, to all the privileges of British-born subjects of Her Majesty'. It would have been certainly advisable, probably necessary, for Bender to become a naturalised British subject in order to occupy and enjoy the profits of Crown land, and it prevented his internment during World War I. On 23 December 1880 Bender became the sole leaseholder and, after settling a dispute with Coulson involving the Supreme Court, the partnership was dissolved on 7 October 1890. By this time Bender had almost doubled the size of Moody Valley Farm to 7,000 acres by the acquisition of adjoining land from Captain <a href=\"/biographies/packe_robert\">PACKE</a>, and incorporating more Crown land. The land was poor with several stone runs (and included the 1982 battlegrounds of Two Sisters and Mount Tumbledown). Governor <a href=\"/biographies/kerr_thomas\">KERR</a> considered that Bender overstocked his farm and with the fluctuating price of wool he never became wealthy but rather eked out an honest living by exporting wool and hides and, in addition, supplying Stanley with mutton. In 1916 the Admiralty Wireless Station was built at the head of Stanley Harbour on Bender's land.</p><p>On 31 May 1888, he married Hannah Conisbee who gave her age as 30, though her English birth certificate states that she was born on 30 March 1857. Hannah had been companion-seamstress to a wealthy lady taking a world cruise and had been so horribly seasick rounding Cape Horn that she begged to be put off at the next piece of land to recover. It happened to be the Falklands and although she was given a handsome pension and told to make her own way home to rejoin her mistress, Bender courted her and they married in St Mary's Catholic Church. She bore him eight children, (seven girls, one boy,) in the space of 12 years and four months. As a devout Catholic, it was easier for Bender to pay for one of the nuns in Stanley to come out and be their governess than for seven children to be transported the three miles into town and back every day - one of the earliest examples of a 'travelling teacher'. Even in such a remote colony, the girls were taught to play the piano and to be young ladies. Bender was a strict disciplinarian who would not countenance swearing or drunkenness and insisted on perfect table manners from all his many children. In later years, he was a stout figure with a flowing white beard. He cut his two youngest daughters off without a penny for going to England: Dorothy in 1922 to escape being put upon as the youngest daughter after her mother died on 21 September 1916, and Beatrice in 1923 to marry a naval telegraphist who had served at Moody Brook. In Dorothy's case, Bender promised to pay her return passage if ever she changed her mind, but he knew that his money was safe. He died on 6 December 1924.</p><p>Beatrice's son, Peter <a href=\"/biographies/millam_peter\">MILLAM</a>, returned to the Falklands as the Anglican priest in 1966. Bender's story is that of a foreign pioneer settler, who by grit and determination helped establish a viable economy and stable community, thereby laying the foundation of the prosperous overseas territory we see today.</p><p><a href=\"/biographies/goss_christina\">See Image 161</a></p>",

        "body": "<p>civil servant and naturalist, was born in London on 26 January 1888, the son of Henry and Eliza Bennett. His first job was in the Post Office of the House of Commons, and he also ran a small business selling ornithological specimens and apparatus. Frustrated by poor prospects of promotion he moved to the Falkland Islands in 1912, and began work as a customs officer. Bennett married Ethel Eliza Axton and she followed him from England to the Falkland Islands after the birth of their second child - Stanley <a href=\"/biographies/bennett_stanley\">BENNETT</a> (b1911). They had three more children: Alice (b1914, who died as a child), Harold <a href=\"/biographies/bennett_stanley\">BENNETT</a> (b1916, who had a distinguished career in government service) and Arthur (b1918).</p><p>Bennett spent eight southern summer seasons on Deception Island, in the South Shetlands, serving variously as deputy collector of customs, chief customs officer, receiver of wrecks, whaling officer and postmaster. His first season was 1913-1914, when twelve floating factories and a large shore station operated at Deception, then the main centre of Antarctic whaling. During the 1921/1922 whaling season he took part in the relief of the British Imperial Antarctic Expedition when two of its members - Bagshawe and Lester - had overwintered at Water Boat Point in Andvord Bay. On Deception Island Bennett made an annual collection of penguin eggs, for food and also for study and display in various museums. During his forays he would take fresh bread and a little butter in order to be able to produce fresh egg sandwiches - the eggs were boiled in the hot volcanic water.</p><p>Bennett was an accomplished naturalist, and a number of the Discovery Expedition reports bear witness to his skills as an observer and recorder of the natural world. He was appointed Assistant Government Naturalist in 1922. Sir Sidney <a href=\"/biographies/harmer_sir\">HARMER</a> (1882-1950), the Director of the British Museum (Natural History), used the occasion of his Presidential Addresses to the Linnean Society of London in 1928 and 1930 to draw attention to the parlous state of some species of whales, and the statistics that he used were based on the meticulous work of Bennett. Dr Stanley <a href=\"/biographies/kemp_stanley\">KEMP</a>, the Director of the Discovery Expedition, wrote the Report of 1932 (concerning the distribution of whales) in collaboration with Bennett. The Discovery Report of 1937 contains a substantial report on the coastal fishes of the Patagonian region by JR Norman from the Natural History Museum who pays tribute to the work of Bennett: 'he provided detailed notes of the occurrences and habits of the fishes, which have proved of great value, and many of them are included in this report'. The Preface of the Discovery Report of 1946 on South Atlantic fishes states that most of the specimens were obtained by Bennett.</p><p>Bennett was an expert self-taught taxidermist and responsible for many of the exhibits in the Old Town Hall Museum (destroyed by fire in 1944). He preserved and mounted several hundred birds displayed there and made many of the original display cases. In 1922 and 1923 he was responsible for the preparation and dispatch of many of the Falklands exhibits for the 1924 British Empire Exhibition at Wembley. His family recall that he was an accomplished shoe and boot repairer, and delighted in the fact that during his time in the Falkland Islands he acquired the nickname of 'Old Big Feet'.</p><p>Bennett strongly opposed the introduction of the Patagonian Fox to Weddell lest it threaten the indigenous bird population. He was over-ruled by the Government, but several years later successfully prevented its introduction to New Island and Carcass Island. He was an accomplished photographer and water colourist and during the 1920s was regularly commissioned by Government to conduct surveys of the population of penguin and seal colonies. Many of the early wildlife photographs that exist today are the work of Bennett and his friend, Arthur <a href=\"/biographies/cobb_arthur\">COBB</a>. He contributed to numerous scientific journals and wrote the first definitive list of all birds in the Falkland Islands and the Dependencies, published in <em>Ibis </em>in 1926. This 'List' was used by the Discovery Expedition of 1927 as the basis for cataloguing the birds of the region.</p><p>After his last summer on Deception Island, Bennett continued as customs officer in Stanley, until he retired in 1938. Shortly after his retirement the Bennetts returned to England where they settled in Billericay, Essex. He continued to keep a lively interest in the Falkland Islands and regularly attended rifle competitions at Bisley whenever the Colony entered a team. Bennett returned briefly to the Falkland Islands in 1946 on behalf of London Zoo to supervise the shipment of a number of live penguins. He corresponded with Arthur Cobb, of Bleaker Island, from 1907 until 1954, exchanging detailed comments about the bird life of the Falkland Islands and complaining constantly about the failings of government officials in the Islands, and problems with publishers.</p><p>A group of islands in Hanusse Bay, near Adelaide Island were named after Bennett to commemorate his scientific achievements in Antarctica. They comprise, from north to south, South Granicher Island, Praff Island, Mugge Island, Megaw Island and Weertman Island, and are located 66°56' South and 67°42' West. His detailed knowledge of shellfish has been marked by the naming of a species after him - <em>Gammaropsis bennetti </em>- first collected and identified by Bennett at Deception Island in January 1918. His book <em>Whaling in the Antarctic </em>was published by Wm Blackwood in 1931. In the Preface he commented: 'This book is based on thirteen years experience, during which a total of four years has been actually spent at sea with the whaling fleet. The illustrations are taken from my own photographs'. His many publications are listed in the <em>Falkland Islands Journal </em>of 1995.</p><p>Arthur Bennett suffered from angina during the latter years of his life, and he died suddenly, aged 74, on 26 October 1954. Ethel Bennett died, aged 78, in 1961. Bennett had served the government of the Falkland Islands and the Dependencies for 26 years with great distinction. He had a wide variety of skills and interests, and he made a significant contribution to the understanding of the flora and fauna of the South Atlantic.</p>",

He was educated in Stanley at St Mary's Sisters' school and then at the government school. He helped Jack McGill in his butchery as a lad and had a keen interest in rearing hens and ducks, trying for an improved strain and good egg production. He joined the civil service on 1 April 1932, firstly at the Penguin Daily News office, and then moved to the post office as mail officer travelling on the SS <em>Fitzroy </em>round the Islands. He maintained a keen interest in sports, football and athletics as well as boxing. He joined the Falkland Islands Defence Force before the outbreak of war and became secretary of the badminton club. With the outbreak of World War II on 3 September 1939, Bennett was sent to the Camber on outpost duties. He later served as clerk in the FIDF headquarters. He moved on to work in the Treasury and the Secretariat before joining the Legal Department. In 1949 he was made a Justice of the Peace and appointed registrar-general and registrar to the Supreme Court. Over the next 33 years Bennett presided over the courts, dispensing legal advice to the public, drawing up deeds, drafting legislation and performed many marriages. From 1957 to 1959 he took study leave in England, becoming a member of the Inns of Court and enrolling in the Middle Temple. He qualified in Criminal Law. During his busy career he served on ExCo and LegCo before retiring in 1982 as senior magistrate having devoted more than 50 years to the service of the Colony.</p><p>In 1947 he visited Britain as part of the rifle team which won the Junior McKinnon and the Colapore Cups at Bisley, and brought both back to Stanley to display in the Gymnasium. In 1953 he was a member of the contingent representing the Islands at the Coronation Parade in London.</p><p>Harold Bennett married Grace Turner (widow) in 1961 and the service was performed by his brother Stanley, a unique event. He inherited his father's interest in natural history, and while on leave took various birds, mainly penguins, to zoological gardens in England to restock after the war. He became a member of the Zoological Society of London. After the death of Jack McGill's widow, Bennett inherited the property known as McGill's Butchery and other lands which included the Butchery Buildings adjacent to Dairy Paddock and some paddocks to the west of the racecourse. He also inherited the large house and garden on the junction of King Street and Allardyce Street where he pursued his hobby of gardening and the love of roses which he grew in the large conservatory.</p><p>He had a great interest in horses, probably fostered by McGill, who had a few horses himself, and became for a number of years secretary of the Stanley Sports Association. Bennett was a patriotic man: he hedged and stalled continually when, during the Argentine occupation in 1982 he was flown in from camp at the 'request' of the authorities, to adjust the laws of the Islands to the Argentine system. He had a proud moment in 1983 when Mrs Thatcher visited the Islands: as the cavalcade drove along St Mary's Walk below his house, he rushed into the road, the cars stopped, and he presented the Prime Minister with a beautiful rose from his conservatory.</p><p>Bennett was a staunch defender of the sovereignty of the Islands, a firm Christian and a regular communicant at Christ Church Cathedral. He predeceased his wife when he died on 12 December 1999 in Stanley, a well-respected member of the community.</p><p><a href=\"/biographies/arrowsmith_sir\">See Image 12</a></p>",

His mother took him to the Falkland Islands with his elder brother when his father took an appointment with government as whaling officer and magistrate based at Deception Island in the Antarctic. Bennett senior was away from his home in Stanley for each summer until 1928. Stanley Bennett had poor eyesight and was taken to England for consultations, but the result was a prescription which remained constant all his life (and it did not prevent him becoming an excellent marksman with the ·22 rifle and shotgun). His last journey to England coincided with the return of the cadet crew of the sailing ship <em>Fennia </em>(which remained for many years as a floating store in Stanley Harbour). Although an Anglican, Bennett was educated in the Sisters' School at St Mary's Church, and in Palmers Green on visits to London.</p><p>He was apprenticed to the carpenter's shop in the Public Works Department of FIG and followed that trade all his working life. He progressed from carpenter joiner at the bench to foreman carpenter in 1953-4 and then to general foreman in PWD and assistant superintendent. Apart from the usual repair and maintenance work on FIG property he was involved in the construction of the Gymnasium on Ross Road, the erection of Darwin boarding school, the Port Howard school and numerous other projects. He took on the job of undertaker/funeral director for 13 years.</p><p>Bennett was an active person walking many miles in pursuit of wildfowl and was well-known as an angler first with a hand line and then with a rod, fishing for mullet. He was famed for his ability in foot events, especially the one mile. He was a Sea Scout and became a Rover Scout and a member of their racing crew. Through the classes held for the Scouts by Dean Lumsdale he became interested in the Cathedral and joined many committees. He became chaplain's warden, then bishop's warden, and was finally licensed as a lay reader by Bishop <a href=\"/biographies/evans_daniel\">EVANS</a>. He campaigned to ensure that the Cathedral remained under the aegis of Canterbury, rather than in the diocese of Buenos Aires.</p><p>He married Ruth Margaret Harvey of Chartres Farm on 4 July 1936. They had one son, Neville Kenneth (b1937) and in 1945 a daughter who did not survive. His wife died in Stanley in 1969. Bennett died in Stanley on 22 March 1984. During the Conflict, on 2 April 1982, he spoke indignantly to his son about the hauling down of the Union flag at Government House, in full view of his front room. He promised to look out each day until it was put back again - unfortunately when that happened, he was taking an after lunch nap!</p>",

        "body": "<p>Norwegian gunner and whaling manager, was born on the island Vestre Bolærne, on 7 October 1880, the son of Bernt <a href=\"/biographies/sorensen_bernt\">SØRENSEN</a>. He started his career at sea early, first as able seaman apprentice with his father, whaling in the north. In 1902 or 1903 he worked as a gunner off Iceland, owning a catcher called <em>Ingebjørg </em>and later the <em>Laquritz Berg </em>. By 1907, he was also a main shareholder of Tønsberg Hvalfangeri A/S. He was employed as manager, 27 years old, for the expedition to South Georgia. The factory ship was <em>Bucentaur </em>and the two catchers, <em>Mathilde  </em>and <em>Karl </em>. His father Bernt was gunner on <em>Karl </em>, and his uncle Søren was gunner on <em>Mathilde </em>.</p><p>Søren Berntsen worked as manager at Husvik Harbour from the start of operations in 1907, until 1917. In this capacity he received the explorer Ernest <a href=\"/biographies/shackleton_sir\">SHACKLETON</a> when Thoralf <a href=\"/biographies/sorlle_thoralf\">SØRLLE</a> brought him round from Stromness on 21 May 1916. Berntsen ensured that the whale catcher <em>Southern Star </em>was promptly prepared to sail to rescue the rest of the party from Elephant Island - unsuccessfully as it turned out. In 1917 he started a whaling company and operated from Ireland. This was not a success, and in 1922 he was back in Tønsberg Hvalfangeri A/S as a manager on the expeditions with the factory ship <em>Orwell I </em>to South Orkney. On the way from South Georgia to Borge Harbour {Bruce Bay} at Signy Island, they always stopped when they arrived at the sea ice. At these stops, they successfully undertook 'pelagic'* whaling. In <em>Whaling History </em>by Tønnesen, Søren Berntsen has been called 'the father of pelagic whaling'. He was manager for the South Orkney expeditions up to 1931-32. During the season 1934-35 he was a gunner with the 'Svend Foyn' expedition. In 1934 he started once again as manager, but this time in a company called 'Skyttern A/S'. The factory ship <em>Skyttern </em>was a 'modern' factory ship designed for pelagic whaling. The season 1937-38 was his last season. He suffered a stroke in September 1938, and was partly paralysed with impaired speech. He died on 9 September 1940.</p><p>Søren Berntsen was a keen photographer and diarist, writing regular letters to his wife. Many of his pictures, diaries and letters have been preserved by his family and present an interesting record of the life of a whaling manager at that time. He had a daughter Ragnhild and a second daughter Anne Marie was born in South Georgia, but died in the Spanish Influenza pandemic of 1918-1919.</p><p><a href=\"/biographies/shackleton_sir\">See Image 308</a></p>",

        "body": "<p>sea captain and farmer, was born in Buenos Aires on 20 February 1909, the son of James Godfrey Wickham Bertrand and Mfanwy Sian (Daisy) Bertrand, née Jones. His father was farming in Argentina at the time, and his mother was the eldest daughter of Erasmus Jones of the London and River Plate Bank. He had two brothers, Robert (Robbie) and Erasmus (Ras) neither of whom married, and a sister Yvonne who had three sons.</p><p>Home was the family farm, Sierra Ventana, Santa Cruz. Bertrand also attended school in Buenos Aires, living with his maternal uncle. He grew up on the farm, doing all the usual chores, riding everywhere, taming horses and using the <em>boleadores* </em>to catch ostrich and wild cattle. He learned to work leather and to make the horse gear that was part of a working life. When he was seventeen he took charge of 460 cattle on a drive in early winter, cutting across the Pava ranges instead of going round. They were caught in a huge blizzard and had to use their troop of horses to break a trail for the cattle, so what should have taken them a week stretched to fifteen days. On that fifteenth day they managed to reach the top of little Mesa which was very narrow, and fourteen miles away below them they could see the farm they were heading for. They had to drive the cattle along for five miles before they found the ravine leading downwards, and it was blocked with snow. They realised that they and the animals would die if they remained there. One of the other boys very bravely decided to try to break trail with his horse, and succeeded in doing so, but even so they encountered great difficulty in persuading their horse troop and the cattle to follow. Eventually the animals went down in single file, and their arrival at the farm was greeted with some horror, and astonishment that they had survived.</p><p>Bertrand came to the Falklands in 1928 and went to work at Roy Cove, where his father had been born, and where his uncle Howard Clement was manager. He then spent a short time on Carcass Island working for Jason and Daisy Hansen before joining the sealing vessel <em>Afterglow </em>in 1930. He also worked on the <em>Fleuris </em>which ran between Stanley and South Georgia. He joined the whaling fleet which went south in the summers, returning to the Falklands at the end of each whaling season when he would again join the <em>Afterglow </em>for the winter's sealing.</p><p>In 1931 Bertrand married Muriel (Dubbie) Newing, daughter of Henry and Elizabeth Newing. They had two daughters, Natalia Mfanwy Newing (b1933) and Yolanda Irene (b1938).</p><p>In 1935 Bertrand saved the life of Nevin McGill who fell from the accommodation ship <em>Bellville  </em>in Albermarle harbour, nearly losing his own life. The decks were covered in ice and McGill slipped and fell overboard. Bertrand jumped in after him in his heavy cold weather clothing and big sea boots, managing to catch hold of McGill, and to cling to the anchor chain until a rope was lowered. By the time McGill had been hauled back on deck and the rope lowered again, Bertrand was in dire straits. He was offered a lifesaving medal but refused the honour.</p><p>Bertrand left the Falklands in 1938 to take up a partnership in a fruit farm in Chile. The farm was completely destroyed in the earthquake of 1939, and the Bertrand family managed to get to Punta Arenas where Cecil worked on a sheep farm for a time. He returned to the Falklands in 1940, and joined the SS <em>Fitzroy </em>during which time he held several positions, from stoker to steward to able seaman.</p><p>He bought a share in the schooner <em>Porvenir  </em>in 1944, and the following year took command - she was the last trading schooner to work around the Falklands, and carried general cargo, wool, and live animals to and from the farms and Stanley. There were always two others besides Bertrand on the ship, one of whom was Bertrand's cousin, Roddy Napier. At one time the schooner was chartered by the British American Kelp Company to carry out experiments into the growth of kelp around the Islands. This very hard work was done in the autumn in cold, arduous conditions. The kelp was cut by hand three feet below the surface of the water, dragged into a dinghy and taken back to the ship to be weighed. In 1945 the <em>Fitzroy  </em>was damaged at Triste Island and the <em>Porvenir  </em>took over her wool-carrying commitments for a time.</p><p>Bertrand and his wife were divorced in 1947, and he married Kitty Napier in 1948. Later on he exchanged his share of the <em>Porvenir </em>for the lease of the Arch Islands and then in 1950 moved to East Island. In 1953 the Bertrands bought Carcass Island from Mrs Hansen and settled down to breed Polwarth sheep. In 1958 Bertrand bought the auxillary ketch <em>Foam </em>which had been built to his specifications in Denmark, and for many years <em>Foam  </em>was a familiar sight around the Islands. In 1974 the Bertrands sold Carcass Island to Robin McGill, but continued to live there until 1980 when they moved to Stanley.</p><p>Bertrand was a hunter turned conservationist. He was enormously respected by all who knew him, and in the Falklands tradition could turn his hand to anything. He was a big man, of huge physical strength. Although a farmer in later years, his skill and wisdom at sea in the most incredible storms was legendary. He died on 9 December 1985 and is buried in Stanley cemetery where the wheel of the <em>Porvenir  </em>forms the headstone of his grave.</p>",

        "body": "<p>farmer, was baptized in Dominica (British West Indies) on 21 December 1837, the sixth of seven children of Edmund Rufus Bertrand and Frances Elizabeth Bertrand, née Lee. His father was a planter and their home Tabery Estate. Bertrand was educated in England under the care of his uncle Godfrey Bolle Lee, subsequently travelling in India and Australia.</p><p>Bertrand learned sheep farming on the estates of his Lee cousin in the Canterbury district in New Zealand and by 1867 was working alongside Ernest <a href=\"/biographies/holmested_ernest\">HOLMESTED</a> on Matson Station. Together the two men set sail on the <em>Paria </em>for Valparaiso where they arrived in August of that year. They crossed the Andes by mule and on foot, 'crossing the saddle of the Cordillera called Portillo Pass'. When they arrived at Mendoza eleven days later they met John Switzer who was to come with them to the Falklands. They survived a series of hair-raising adventures - Argentina was in the throes of a revolution at this time, with an outbreak of cholera to complicate matters.</p><p>Bertrand and Switzer went to Uruguay where an agent for Smith Bros was prepared to sell their Crown lease on New Island which still had twelve years to run, and this they acquired. There were about four thousand sheep on the island at this time and later these would be used to stock Adelaide Station. Bertrand and Switzer went to the Falklands before committing themselves to anything, and then Bertrand returned to Buenos Aires to collect Holmested; he and Switzer having already acquired from the Colonial Government a licence to occupy Shallow Bay Estate. This was to be called Adelaide Station and included the farms later known as Hill Cove and Roy Cove.</p><p>Bertrand and Holmested landed in Stanley in July 1868, the latter going to Shallow Bay with Switzer. Bertrand, to help with funds, took a job with the Falkland Islands Company at Darwin. He introduced tobacco as an insecticide to be used in the newly-constructed 30ft plunge dip, which method he had used in New Zealand in an effort to eradicate scab in the flocks. Bertrand built a new shearing shed at Darwin: ' a perfect triumph of ingenuity, where the sheep are penned and sheared, and the wool baled, pressed and stowed for shipment all under one roof'. He introduced the slatted tables for rolling fleeces as are in use today, and was also instructed to start scientific breeding to improve the quality of the wool. He was described as being 'evidently a man of business, a sharp decided character, giving the impression that he would stand very little nonsense'.</p><p>Bertrand had by now met his future wife, Catherine Felton, and they were married in September 1868 at Trinity Church, Stanley. They had ten children, Edith Martha (b1869), Maud Alice (b1871), Elinor Frances (b1873), James Godfrey Wickham (b1875, the father of Cecil <a href=\"/biographies/bertrand_cecil\">BERTRAND)</a>, Mabel Kate (b1877), Constance Madeleine (b1878), Nora Annie (b1881), Herbert William Roy, and lastly twin girls born in 1887, Lillian Ella Gladys and Kathleen Maud Phillis.</p><p>In November 1870 Bertrand arrived at Shallow Bay, his contract with the Falkland Islands Company at an end, and shortly after his wife and baby Edith followed him. Switzer had gone back to New Zealand to face a charge of arson, so it was just Holmested and Bertrand who continued in rough and very hard conditions. Maud was born at Shallow Bay in 1871 and baptized there by Thomas <a href=\"/biographies/bridges_thomas\">BRIDGES</a>. At this stage a marked tension was growing between Holmested and Bertrand, and when Holmested returned from leave in England in early 1872 they decided to divide the estate and each take half the debts. A Crown Lease of 1871 had confirmed Bertrand's title to a block of 171,000 acres on the West Falkland, the so-called Adelaide Station. He now agreed to transfer New Island and the area around Shallow Bay to Holmested and Rees, and to keep the western section and farm it from Roy Cove, which he called Westbourne Station.</p><p>By June of 1872 Bertrand was working very hard with a small gang of navvies to construct the new settlement, and in March 1873 the schooner  <em>Louisa </em>took the last of the Bertrands' luggage around to Roy Cove, Bertrand himself driving his share of the sheep from Shallow Bay to their new home.</p><p>There is no information on the years at Roy Cove, except that written by his son-in-law Admiral Chambers. It seems that he was one of the most up-to-date farmers then in the Falklands, and had, contrary to prevailing custom, bought his farm outright. Chambers maintained that Bertrand was not a good man of business; kinder is the assessment of the Falkland Islands Company manager, that he looked upon his property as a cherished hobby rather than a commercial speculation and that his unrestrained generosity led him to give with both hands, helping anyone who asked without consideration or regard to what effect his liberality might have on himself or his family.</p><p>Bertrand and his wife retired to England, and he died in 1914. They are buried in Chichester.</p>",

        "body": "<p>mother and philatelist, was born on 29 August 1929 the middle child and only daughter of Theodore Conrad 'Con' Rowlands and Lucy, née Larsen. As well as brothers John <a href=\"/biographies/rowlands_john\">ROWLANDS</a> (b 1928), and Harold <a href=\"/biographies/rowlands_harold\">ROWLANDS</a> (b 1931), she had an elder half brother Robert Yates from Lucy Larsen's first marriage. Her paternal grandfather was a Swedish sea captain (originally Rylander, anglicised to Rowlands) married to the daughter of a Dumfries tea merchant and her maternal grandfather a Norwegian married to an Englishwoman. Betty attended Stanley schools where she was a capable but rebellious pupil. She stubbornly resisted all attempts to make her change from writing with her left hand as was the custom of most teachers at the time. For a short period during World War II she was evacuated from Stanley and lived with an uncle and aunt at Darwin.</p><p>Like most children from poorer families at that time, Betty Rowlands and her brothers worked part-time after school and at weekends, John as a peat boy while Betty did domestic work for a neighbour and delivered bills and the local newspaper. After leaving school she continued to work for the Dixon family for 10 shillings per month until she turned 16 and was able to obtain work as an auxiliary nurse. This came with the bonus of accommodation in the nurses' house, and escape from the strict rules at home. Nursing was learned on the job and with no formal training. Betty soon found herself on night duty, in sole charge and responsible for deciding whether to wake the matron or sister who would be asleep in the hospital, to deal with a new arrival or very ill or demanding patient. One of the highlights of this time was nursing the much decorated SAS war hero Colonel Blair (Paddy) Mayne after he was invalided out of his post-war job in the Antarctic and was in the KEMH for a short time. Learning of Mayne's love of roses, Betty 'borrowed' some for him from a patient who would not miss them. She was amused when, in spite of his back injury, he escaped through a window one evening to attend a party at Government House.</p><p>In 1947 Betty married Basil William Biggs (1918-1987), who had recently returned from RAF service in India and Burma and was working as hospital caretaker. By January 1954 when Basil was appointed policeman/handyman for South Georgia and the family moved there, they had had three children, Janet (b1948), Coleen (b1949) and Peter (b1951). The move meant a higher wage and better housing. As one of a handful of women on the Island, Betty had to sew and knit clothing for the growing children as well as teaching them. Ships were infrequent and there was no mail for months in winter. She showed great skill and ingenuity in producing snow suits for three children from available materials like blankets, bedspreads and cast-off adult clothing.</p><p>Teaching was another matter; it was difficult to obtain books and materials and even more difficult for her to pin down three lively children for lessons. However, none appears to have suffered from their irregular and unconventional early education. Socially there were card evenings and occasional parties. The wives had to be very self-sufficient and some lasting friendships were formed between people from very disparate backgrounds. Betty's quiet kindness is remembered by many who passed time in South Georgia in the 16 years she spent there. Some of the Norwegian whalers also became family friends: Einar Strand the blacksmith was one who loved to escape for a game of cribbage and Betty still plays with the brass board he made in the 1950s. For a while there was an explorer in the attic; one of Duncan <a href=\"/biographies/carse_verner\">CARSE</a>'s mapping expeditions had run into some difficulty so he had to lodge with the Biggs household for a time. The only space available was in the loft so he camped there.</p><p>Winters were hard and long and the entire family learned to ski; occasionally Betty would ski around to the whaling station to watch a film in the 'kino'. In 1967 Betty, now expecting a fourth child, was sent to Stanley on the mid-winter trip of RMS <em>Darwin </em>. The doctor on board became anxious and asked if there was anything faster in the area. Fortuitously, and fortunately, HMS <em>Lynx </em>was on passage from South Africa so came to the rescue. After a dramatic mid-ocean rendezvous at night when Betty was tied onto a stretcher and winched into and out of a small boat for the transfer, HMS <em>Lynx </em>set off at speed for the Falklands. The Captain famously announced to the ship's company that Mrs Biggs was no more likely to give birth on board than he was. Pauline Lynx Biggs was born as they sailed into Stanley harbour.</p><p>Betty Biggs has been a stamp enthusiast since childhood and on South Georgia she had an opportunity to do some work for London stamp dealers who had special requirements. She spent many nights tearing and sticking stamps to catch the rare outward mails. Back in the Falklands, Betty was able to put her stamp expertise to good use in the early 1970s when the postmaster Henry Luxton asked her to work part-time fulfilling the many specialist stamp orders received by the post office. Demand grew and eventually the philatelic bureau was set up. One of the tasks that Betty undertook for the bureau after the Falklands war in 1982 was to travel to South Georgia to release new stamp issues there. She enjoyed the work and continued to serve her many specialist customers until forced to take early retirement during the financial panic of the early 1990s, when Falklands councillors decided to save money by replacing a number of experienced people with school leavers.</p><p>Always patriotic, Betty supports the Falkland Islands Association and just before the war in 1982 she felt so strongly about the assumption being made that 'leaseback' would be good for the Falklands that she took action. The Foreign Office, as represented in the Islands by Governor <a href=\"/biographies/hunt_sir\">HUNT</a>, was mooting the idea that a leaseback arrangement with Argentina would be good for the Falklands and 'solve' the sovereignty problem. One of the councillors, having toured part of West Falkland, claimed most people were in favour. Betty and a friend, convinced that this was not true in Stanley, visited the majority of households with a simple questionnaire asking whether or not people favoured leaseback. The result, an almost unanimous 'no', was given to Rex Hunt. Unfortunately there is no public record of how far this message was relayed.</p><p>Betty now lives as she wishes under the union flag which was painted on her roof in Stanley by friends and enjoys regular visits from her family, especially the younger grandchildren and great grandchildren - and the occasional folk-night in the pubs.</p>",

        "body": "<p>civil servant, was born in Stanley, Falkland Islands, on 4 September 1916, the eldest surviving son of the large family of Bernard Claud Biggs and Kathleen Mary Biggs. In childhood he contracted polio, spending several years in bed. He was left with a weak leg and permanent limp and had to wear a caliper. On leaving school, he became messenger boy for the Falkland Islands Company and believed the cycling strengthened his leg to the extent that he was able to do without the caliper. In spite of the lack of formal schooling he had a very alert mind and soon became clerk in the office of the King Edward VII Memorial Hospital. Here he met his future wife Miriam MacGill and married in 1936. They had three children, Noeline (b1937), Kim (b1939) and Rosina (b1946). He took to married life with enthusiasm, keeping an excellently productive vegetable garden, a peat shed filled with good peat and a cow to provide his family with milk.</p><p>Biggs joined the FIDF, thoroughly enjoying the training camps and exercises. Because of his disability he was unable to join his brothers when they enlisted for service with the British forces at the start of World War II. As a result, he was nicely placed when the Falkland Islands Government was looking to fill the position of customs officer and post master in South Georgia. In 1942, he and his wife and two children travelled there on RMS <em>Fitzroy </em>and spent the next three years on the Island. The job was interesting and varied as there were then three active whaling stations and the oil produced had to be monitored, entailing trips on the small whale catchers; somewhat of an ordeal for a man who was a notoriously bad sailor. In his spare time, he learned to speak Spanish. Everyone had to learn to ski and suitably small skis were specially made at the Grytviken Whaling Station for the children.</p><p>In 1945 the family returned to Stanley and Biggs was appointed senior customs officer for the Falkland Islands. He enjoyed the work, and in 1949 Governor Miles <a href=\"/biographies/clifford_sir\">CLIFFORD</a> arranged for him to receive training in London. The family, which now included another daughter, spent six enjoyable months there whilst Noel was working with HM Customs at Tilbury. In 1952, again sponsored by the Governor, he applied for a posting to another British territory.</p><p>In March 1952, Biggs took up his post as collector of customs and excise in Mombasa, Kenya, where a very successful and satisfying career within the East African Customs and Excise Department ensued. He enjoyed his contact with the diverse shipping around the Coast and in due course learned the intricacies of the brewing industry where it attracted excise duty. He was serving in Dar es Salaam, Tanganyika, as regional commissioner of customs when the territory was granted independence.</p><p>He retired to the United Kingdom in 1964. Miriam died of cancer in 1958. In 1961, Biggs married Agnes Power, a nursing sister from Waterford in Southern Ireland, and they had three daughters: Kathleen (b1963), Bernadine (b1967) and Sheelah (b1970). After a short spell in Hampshire he moved to Southern Ireland, where he bought a piece of land on the Waterford coast and set up a very successful caravan park. Here he brought up his new family. He battled for several years with Parkinson's disease and died in Co Waterford in 1987. His wife Agnes died in 2003.</p>",

        "body": " <p>sapper and patriarch, was born in Portsea, Hants, the seventh of twelve children of Samuel Biggs and Jane, née Whitcomb, and baptised at St Mary's Church on 6 July 1806. Nothing is known of his early years but it seems that he acquired a trade as a miner, and probably as a boy soldier before enlisting once he reached the minimum age of eighteen. Biggs joined the Royal Corps of Sappers and Miners at Portsmouth in March 1825. His military papers describe him as five feet six and a half inches tall with brown complexion and hair, and blue eyes. In June 1826 he embarked for Gibraltar where the Sappers would be employed maintaining the important fortifications and naval dockyard. In Gibraltar Biggs would experience two of the hazards encountered by soldiers at the time: epidemic disease and military discipline. In 1828 the Rock suffered a serious outbreak of yellow fever, and it was decided to encamp the troops on high ground in order to escape infection. Despite these measures the epidemic took the lives of four privates of the company's strength of forty-eight and many more, including Biggs, were recorded as sick. Biggs was probably still recovering when he was court-martialled for 'unsoldierlike conduct' and using abusive language to a non-commissioned officer. He was sentenced to twenty-one days' imprisonment but must have been suitably contrite as only eight days were served.</p><p>In this heightened atmosphere love blossomed, and on 28 September 1829 James Biggs and the very young Margaret Martin were married in the King's Chapel, Gibraltar. In 1830 the company was back in England, but on 23 September Biggs with twenty-two other men again sailed for Gibraltar. In 1834 cholera swept through the garrison causing 380 deaths. Biggs was one of those hospitalised, and was soon in trouble with authority again for being disorderly in his quarters and using improper and threatening language to a non-commissioned officer. On Christmas Eve 1837 Biggs left Gibraltar for the last time and began a posting in England, at Hythe and later Woolwich. The Biggs's first child, William, had been born in January 1831 and a second child, Elizabeth Jane, was born on 15 September 1833. A third child, Amelia, was born in 1838, and a son, James Samuel, was born at Woolwich on 28 May 1841.</p><p>Living near the edge of overcrowded London with a wife and four children to support may have made Biggs consider other possibilities, so that when Lieutenant-Governor <a href=\"/biographies/moody_richard\">MOODY</a> called for volunteers to accompany him to the Falkland Islands, he volunteered and was accepted. Biggs had served briefly under Moody and was evidently willing to entrust his family's future to him; he would also have been aware of the tradition of transferring from the garrison in a colony to become a settler.</p><p>The Sapper detachment (which included Biggs, Yates and Herkes accompanied by wives and families) embarked from Woolwich Dockyard on 9 October 1841 on the merchant brig <em>Hebe </em>. They arrived at Port Louis in mid-January 1842. Though ready to defend the colony if the need arose, their primary occupation was construction and repair and Moody requested labourers to serve as chainmen for survey tasks as his detachment were: 'artificers, carpenters, masons, bricklayers and smith and good workmen at their different trades. Their present working pay is one shilling &amp; sixpence per diem whereas Civil artificers in a colony would require 7 or 8 shillings per day'. The Sappers all had to ride and made themselves very expert in the management of horses.</p><p>The first winter must have been particularly difficult with a shortage of firing and fresh provisions. One benefit of these straitened circumstances, with no goods of any kind on which to spend their money, was evident in July 1843 when Biggs exchanged cash to the value of one hundred and fifty pounds for a promissory note from Moody. This was an exceptionally large amount for a soldier of lowly rank to accumulate.</p><p>When the seat of government was moved from Port Louis to Port Jackson (later Stanley), William Biggs, as the youngest member of staff at Government House, raised the flag at the new capital. The move had meant extreme hardship for the men and their loyalty and hard work was recognised by Moody:</p><blockquote><blockquote>The tents in winter with snow around and wet beneath constantly at work out of doors all their clothes wet and at night little or no fire to dry them; carrying and boating stores, wading in the water on sharp and stony beaches to load and unload boats...Their constant employment at all kinds of rough, hard and laborious work such as carrying on their backs stones, timbers etc. making excavations, drains, road, jetties, building house etc. and this done on wet grass, peaty mud, gravelly and stony beaches with no roads or path.</blockquote></blockquote><p>Moody increased the detachment's pay, justifying the expense by pointing out that:</p><blockquote><blockquote>The strict rules of discipline and a few empty praises from myself were the only alternative and I imagine your Lordship [the Secretary of State] would scarcely approve of such being the only means to arouse and support the energies of men situated as the Detachment here has been.</blockquote></blockquote><p>Biggs's pay was increased to two shillings per day.</p><p>Exposure to the elements was not the only danger - the wild cattle ranging over both East and West Falkland were a useful source of food but also a hazard to the unwary. On one occasion a party of sappers were on a hunting expedition outside Stanley when their camp was attacked by a number of wild horses and four savage bulls. Connolly's <em>History of the Sappers and Miners </em>tells how, rifles in hand, the troops ran out of their tent:</p><blockquote><blockquote>Two of the bulls only, stood their ground; and though struck by two bullets, rushed on furiously, and forced the party to beat a hasty retreat. A position was rapidly taken up among some barrels and timber, undercover of which the men were reloading; but the onslaught of the bulls was so impetuous that the operation was interrupted and the party driven into the tents. One of the animals now trotted off; but the other, still pursuing, bolted after the men into the marquee. A ball from private Biggs's rifle fortunately stopped his career, and turning round the infuriated animal tore up the tent, committed great havoc through the camp, and made a plunge at private Yates, who dextrously stepped aside, and firing, shot the bull in the head, and combat ceased.</blockquote></blockquote><p>A fifth Biggs child, Edward Falkland, was born in February 1844 at Port Louis and their sixth child, John Christie, was born in Stanley in 1845. In 1846 Biggs purchased a plot of land, the Arch Green area. Early photographs show a small weatherboard cottage on that site. In 1848, with Moody's term of office as governor at an end, arrangements were made to withdraw the small sapper detachment. Three decided to buy their discharge and remain in the Falklands. Biggs had completed more than twenty-four years, and received an army pension of one shilling and one penny halfpenny per day. He had grown one inch during his service, acquired a scar on his chin, and chronic rheumatism, a legacy of the winter of 1844 spent under canvas in Stanley. His character and conduct were described as very good. In late February 1853 Biggs was accidentally shot while out in a boat. The story passed down relates that he bled to death before the doctor in Stanley could be reached. James Biggs's widow Margaret died on 22 January 1861.</p><p>In 1849 a large group of Military <a href=\"/biographies/pensioners_the\">PENSIONERS</a> and their families arrived in Stanley as new settlers. Three years later the eldest Biggs son William married Mary Ann Fleming, the daughter of Irish military pensioner Patrick Fleming, and in January 1853 James and Margaret's first grandchild was born. William and Mary Ann had twelve children. A few months after her father's death Elizabeth married a much older man, Charles <a href=\"/biographies/melville_charles\">MELVILLE</a>, They had five children of whom three survived. Amelia married George Kelway and had fourteen children. James Samuel married Harriet Simpson and had two children. Edward Falkland married Phoebe Summers and they had eleven children. John Christie did not marry.</p><p>The family name is commemorated by Biggs Road in East Stanley and on a small plaque in Crozier Place, but James Biggs is best commemorated by the very foundation of the town of Stanley which he and a handful of others laid out and by his many descendants who are now active in every walk of life in the Falkland Islands.</p>",

        "body": "<p>librarian, teacher and shopkeeper, was born on 26 July 1902 at Marmont Row, Stanley, one of nine children of Vincent and Mary Biggs. Vincent was a shipwright with the Falkland Islands Company as was his father, a combined service of 79 years, and the family were among the original British settlers in the Islands (see James <a href=\"/biographies/biggs_james\">BIGGS)</a>. Educated at St. Mary's, she initially trained to be a teacher and at the age of 17 commenced a lifetime of selfless devotion to the community. Her initial salary was £15 per annum and her teaching legacy lives on to this day. Madge Biggs was government librarian for almost 50 years and overcame problems such as poor communications and erratic external mail deliveries with composure and devotion to duty. Because of her background in photography through her family's expertise, she became the Islands' first radiographer, serving for nine years at the King Edward VII Memorial Hospital. Following the outbreak of World War II in 1939, Madge Biggs became the honorary treasurer of the local branch of the Red Cross Society and it is a measure of her ability and dedication that she was granted life membership. When the threat of Japanese invasion occurred and the substantial British Falkland Islands Force arrived, she organised the popular services canteen and was much distressed when her office at the Town Hall was destroyed in 1944 when the building was lost to fire. With her brothers, she made a valiant attempt at saving the cash takings and the papers but was forced to withdraw after carefully locking the doors in the mistaken belief that the fire would be extinguished. The Library was destroyed and had to be built up again from scratch.</p><p>In retirement her father kept a small sweet shop (the 'Penguin Shop'), which he signed over to his children. Madge ran it after her brother's death and it filled her weekdays and Saturday mornings, while the Library took up the evenings and Saturday afternoons. The shop was sold to the FIC during the 1982 conflict. She was a serious stamp collector and, typically, she gave most of her collection away.</p><p>Madge was appointed to LegCo in 1950 and served for two years - the first woman on Council. A pillar of strength to St. Mary's and a devout Roman Catholic, Madge Biggs played the harmonium every Sunday for 65 years and led the choir for most of that time. She was honoured by two Popes. It is wholly appropriate that at the time of her death on 8 September 1995, Monsignor Agreiter said: 'A great woman has gone home'. It was a privilege to know Madge Biggs and it is disappointing that her one visit to Britain in her later years was for medical attention. She saw little of England and resisted all pleading to come to London and see the famous sites, insisting that she could not be a burden to friends with her incapacity and that she needed to return to her beloved sister Irene. Her only other departure from the Islands was a wartime trip to Montevideo on the SS <em>Fitzroy </em>for new spectacles, a journey she found extremely uncomfortable. In 1949 she was honoured with an MBE presented by Governor CLIFFORD.</p>",

        "body": "<p>civil servant, was born at Stanley on 8 October 1884, the eighth child of William Binnie, journeyman tailor and his wife Marion, née Pope, originally from Lanarkshire. The Binnie children were brought up to be self-sufficient and under the guidance of their father made their own confirmation suits. Edward Binnie joined the Falkland Islands Volunteer Corps and probably entered government service on a temporary basis when he was about 15. In November 1907 he was tasked to accompany the whaling fleet of the <em>Sociedad Ballenera de Magallanes  </em>(Magallanes Whaling Company) to the Antarctic as a customs officer, beginning a lifelong association with the whaling fleet, and the Norwegian seafarers who manned it. His diary of his period at Deception Island in the South Shetlands notes apprehending a Norwegian master who failed to produce a whaling licence, an act which earned Binnie a commendation from Governor <a href=\"/biographies/allardyce_sir\">ALLARDYCE</a> 'for his vigilance in protecting Government interests'. While at Deception, Binnie showed prowess with the camera, an interest which he developed throughout his life, and to which Antarctic historians are now indebted. On his return to Stanley in March 1908, Binnie resumed postal and customs duties until July 1910, when he was appointed deputy collector of customs, deputy postmaster, deputy shipping master and receiver of goose beaks at New Island, West Falkland, where Christian Salvesen &amp; Co had opened a whaling station.</p><p>His next appointment was at South Georgia, to relieve the magistrate James Innes <a href=\"/biographies/wilson_james\">WILSON</a>. On 31 August, Binnie arrived at Grytviken and took up residence in the Little Villa, which had been built specifically to house the magistrate and policeman. He established good relations with the PESCA manager, Captain CA <a href=\"/biographies/larsen_carl\">LARSEN</a>, dining in the manager's house with his family.</p><p>In 1911 the South Georgia whaling boom was at its zenith and it was also the period of the 'heroic age of Antarctic exploration'. In December 1911 the German expedition under Wilhelm <a href=\"/biographies/filchner_wilhelm\">FILCHNER</a> called at South Georgia. Binnie later recalled that he ran out of postage stamps and had to improvise by making a 'Paid at South Georgia' handstamp, inserting the amount of postage. He again showed his skill with the camera, taking many outstanding images which were made into postcards and sold at the Binnie family's 'Orchid Store' in Stanley. In March 1912, he returned to Stanley and was employed on clerical duties in the Treasury. He also undertook a short tour of duty to West Falkland in a small mail boat, the <em>Columbus </em>, to investigate rumours of 'smuggling and the evasion of duty'.</p><p>In October 1912, Binnie was appointed magistrate, postmaster and coroner for the South Shetland Islands and Graham's Land, thereby becoming the first 'Antarctic Magistrate', at a salary of £200 per annum. He took passage on the Norwegian factory ship <em>Hektoria </em>, belonging to the company A/S Hektor, who were intent on establishing a whaling station at Port Foster, Deception Island, which had been notified as a 'Port of Entry' earlier that year. Binnie took with him a number of postage stamps which he overprinted with the words 'Port Foster' and sold to the whaling crews. These, he later claimed, were 'the rarest stamps of the Falkland Islands as the Port Foster frank was never used again'.</p><p>Binnie returned to Stanley in May 1913, assuming duties as acting postmaster and stipendiary magistrate. In July 1914 he was appointed magistrate at South Georgia and arrived on 26 August, bringing the first news of the War. He lived in the Norwegian style magistrate's house at King Edward Point. In November 1914, Sir Ernest <a href=\"/biographies/shackleton_sir\">SHACKLETON</a> arrived with his Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition on board <em>Endurance </em>. Sir Ernest spent one month at South Georgia where with Binnie's support he obtained supplies and coal from the whaling companies while he waited for reports that the ice had retreated. They met up again in 1916 when Shackleton trekked across the South Georgia mountains following his daring voyage from Elephant Island.</p><p>After the war, Binnie remained at South Georgia but in March 1921 he was granted compassionate leave as his father was ill and subsequently died. He was appointed temporarily colonial postmaster and magistrate at Stanley so that he could support his mother and family but in December he returned to South Georgia. He was very much a conservationist and made some very astute observations on the whaling and sealing industries which he transmitted to the Falkland Islands Government and the Discovery Committee.</p><p>Shackleton returned to South Georgia in his ship <em>Quest </em>but died in King Edward Cove on 5 January 1922. His body was sent to England, but when it arrived at Montevideo it was returned to South Georgia following the wishes of his family. The funeral service was conducted half in Norwegian and half in English, with Binnie, as magistrate, officiating for the second part.</p><p>Binnie was a creative and sociable person who had built up a substantial amount of leave at South Georgia. In May 1923 the opportunity arose for a trip to Norway; it was a journey that changed his life. While he was at Sandefjord, the ship's home port, he met a 24 year-old Norwegian, Margrethe Olaug Larsen, and on 17 October 1923 married her in Oslo. They had four children: Elsa Margrethe (born in Stanley 1924), Sonja (born at King Edward Point in 1926), Haldis Beryl (born in Norway 1928) and Thomas Edward, (born in Norway 1933).</p><p>After a honeymoon in Paris and London, Binnie and his wife returned to the Falklands and he resumed duties at Stanley in January 1924. In late 1925 he returned to South Georgia with his family, taking up residence at the new Magistrate's House. They remained at South Georgia until March 1927, when Binnie took leave to visit Norway. He had been offered a senior post at Stanley, but on 14 October 1928 he resigned from government service, and settled at his wife's family home in Sandefjord.</p><p>It was difficult for 'foreign' subjects to find employment in Norway, but in 1929 he was engaged as ship's secretary on board a factory ship, the <em>Anglo-Norse.  </em>During his periods at 'home' in Sandefjord from May through to October, he stayed with his wife's family, and enjoyed cooking, woodworking and his passion for cars. After the crisis in the whaling industry 1931/32, Binnie joined a South African ship <em>Tafelberg </em>, and served on her until 1941, when she was mined in the Bristol Channel. For the rest of World War II Binnie lived in London, working with Nortraship, the Norwegian Shipping and Trade Mission in the City. He rented rooms and was bombed out twice. At the end of hostilities he was repatriated to Norway, but the stress of war had taken its toll on him.</p><p>In autumn 1945 he became secretary in the British whale factory ship <em>Empire Venture </em>, moving to the Christian Salvesen factory <em>Southern Harvester </em>for her maiden voyage to South Georgia and the Antarctic 1946/47, where he was able to renew old acquaintances. But during the voyage he fell and badly damaged his leg, which forced him to retire from the sea. Thereafter he undertook small private commissions at home and participated in family life. Binnie died at Sandefjord on 26 June 1956.</p>",

        "body": "<p>Antarctic circumnavigator, was born at Ponders End, Middlesex, the son of Thomas and Ann Biscoe, and baptised at Enfield Parish Church in late June 1794. He entered the Royal Navy as a volunteer in 1812 and served in several fighting ships during the 1812-1814 war with the United States*, reaching the rank of acting master of HMS  <em>Moselle  </em>in 1815. After leaving the Navy he served in various merchant ships, largely as mate or master. In 1830, he was appointed by the sealing and whaling firm Messrs Enderby of London to command the brig  <em>Tula  </em>(148 tons) in company with the cutter  <em>Lively  </em>(49 tons) during a voyage to the Southern Ocean. American and British sealers had decimated the Fur Seals of the sub-Antarctic islands, so that, in searching for new sealing grounds, the voyage had a commercial as well as an exploring aim. The Enderbys were well-known for their ability to combine commerce with discovery. One of the Enderby brothers, Charles, was a founding Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society. Biscoe was to be awarded the Society's Royal Premium, the precursor of its gold medal, on his return from the Antarctic in 1833. Having been given instructions by Charles Enderby, the  <em>Tula  </em>and  <em>Lively  </em>departed Gravesend on 14 July 1830. They anchored in Port Louis, Berkeley Sound, in November 1830. Because of the gales it was difficult to get the water casks filled there. Another of Captain Biscoe's troubles there was the desertion of Smith, master of the  <em>Lively:  </em>'in consequence of my reprimanding him for want of attention on board that Vessel'. Smith was replaced by George Avery. Biscoe was surprised to find a small colony at the Falklands and disappointed in his hopes of obtaining provisions at little cost. He noted in his journal that the proprietor, Mr. <a href=\"/biographies/vernet_louis\">VERNET</a>, was selling his lean and badly killed bullocks at £10 each; although there were better ones to the south of East Falkland, these were unavailable. The two small vessels departed on 27 November 1830 to prosecute their southern voyage.</p><p>Biscoe became the third circumnavigator of the Antarctic, the first having been Captain James <a href=\"/biographies/cook_james\">COOK</a> in 1772-75 and the second Thaddeus <a href=\"/biographies/bellingshausen_thaddeus\">BELLINGSHAUSEN</a> of the Imperial Russian Navy in 1819-21. Neither of these two great navigators (nor James <a href=\"/biographies/weddell_james\">WEDDELL</a> in 1822-24) was believed to have sighted recognizable continental land. Biscoe was successful in this, discovering Enderby Land in Greater (East) Antarctica in March 1831. Off Cape Ann, the  <em>Tula  </em>and the  <em>Lively  </em>were separated during what Biscoe described in his journal as a 'perfect hurricane', which lasted for three days. The weather was:</p><blockquote><blockquote>so thick that we could scarcely see twice our own length in any direction, and being so close to ice of every description, were in a very dangerous situation, the vessel being at the same time a complete mass of ice, and the wind blowing so intensely cold, it was impossible for the people to hold anything in their hands for more than a minute or two at a time.</blockquote></blockquote><p>The  <em>Tula  </em>and  <em>Lively  </em>were reunited in Hobart {Tasmania}, where Biscoe sent dispatches to the Enderbys, which were forwarded to the Hydrographer of the Navy, declaring that he was 'firmly of the opinion' that he had discovered 'a large continent, as I saw to an extent of 300 miles.' Approaching the Antarctic Peninsula from the west, across the South Pacific Ocean in February 1832, land was sighted to the south-east, which Biscoe named after Queen Adelaide (now Adelaide Island) in latitude 67°15'S. He described it as having 'a most imposing and beautiful appearance', with 'one very high peak running up into the clouds', which 'occasionally appears both above and below them...' Sailing through what are now the Biscoe Islands, Biscoe pulled into a large inlet of the mountainous coast, and took possession of part of the Antarctic Peninsula, which was later called Graham Land, in the name of King William IV.</p><p>No new sealing grounds were discovered while the vessels proceeded north. After a very rough passage and despite a badly damaged rudder and shattered boats, the  <em>Tula  </em>entered Berkeley Sound once more on 29 April 1832, finding the cutter already lying near two schooners and the wreck of the American ship  <em>Potosi,  </em>at the entrance to Johnson's Harbour. Because the health of them all was 'much impair'd', it was necessary to stay for some time to recover. In addition, with the aid of a pair of blacksmith's bellows, the cooper made iron pintles for the rudder, so that it was eventually reshipped. One of the boats had to be run ashore in a heavy squall and was 'all to pieces' once recovered. Meanwhile an additional boat was being built from half a one picked up from the  <em>Potosi.  </em>On 19 June 1832, the  <em>Tula  </em>and  <em>Lively  </em>sailed from Berkeley Sound to seek Right Whales to the west. However, on 6 July, after reaching the rendezvous of New Island, Biscoe was greatly disappointed to find that the cutter had not arrived. Lying there was the American ship  <em>Martha  </em>with some 1200 barrels of oil on board, whose Captain Young feared the season was over and was about to depart, as had the  <em>John and Edward  </em>that morning, with a full cargo of oil. After a fortnight of gales and heavy squalls, only two fine days and no whales in sight, the crew having repaired the  <em>Tula's  </em>sails, on 20 July she departed to search for the  <em>Lively  </em>along the south coast of the West and East Falklands, examining Beauchêne Island and the Sea Lion Islands in vain. Having sighted 'Mackay's Island' and 'Cape Philip' to his west and northwest in a heavy gale at the end of July, on 5 August Biscoe sent boats to the Volunteer Rocks for seal (in vain) and the  <em>Tula  </em>entered Berkeley Sound, anchoring in Hog Island Passage on 10 August. Here Avery, Master of the  <em>Lively  </em>came aboard with part of the crew. She had been wrecked on Mackay's Island (the present Lively Island), a total loss and they had been taken off by the  <em>Unicorn,  </em>Captain Couzins, who was sailing under Montevidean colours. With extra mouths to feed, Biscoe lowered the crew's bread allowance to 3½lbs a week (with soup daily and 'other necessaries'). They refused to work and he agreed to 5lbs, hoping to stay out for the next sealing season after putting into port for more provisions at St. Catharine's, South America, should his crew not run away. However he remarked in his journal: 'they are quite out of heart with the Voyage &amp; are dropping off one by one, as they find a chance &amp; indeed I can hardly blame them'. He procured a fresh supply of beer, and on 20 August 1832, made sail for the island of St Catharine's, meeting strong gales and irregular seas, one of which struck the ship's try-works, damaging its bricks. By 29 September all but a small remnant of the original crew had deserted and the  <em>Tula </em>limped home across the Atlantic Ocean, to anchor in the Downs on 31 January 1833.</p><p>Ill health must have dogged Biscoe during the remaining ten years of his life, spent as master in the merchant navy, although he appears to have made another voyage of discovery to the south from Sydney in 1838-1839 in the <em>Superb  </em>of which little is known. He and his wife and family lived in Sydney and Hobart from 1837-1843. A subscription list headed by the Arctic explorer Sir John Franklin, at that time lieutenant-governor of Van Diemen's Land {Tasmania}, enabled the ailing Biscoe and his family to embark as passengers in the barque  <em>Janet Izat </em>for England in February 1843. He died and was buried at sea during the long passage home. Two BAS research vessels have been called after him, as has a street in Stanley. The Biscoe Islands off the Antarctic Peninsula were named on his return from the Antarctic, while Biscoe Bay, at the eastern end of the Ross Ice Shelf, was given his name by Captain RF Scott ( <em>Discovery </em>, 1901-04)</p>",

After a further seven years as Rector of Chalgrove and Vicar of Langley, he returned to India to serve in a series of chaplaincies until 1906. He was then Chaplain of the Church Parochial Mission Society until 1910.</p><p>His appointment as third bishop of the Falkland Islands was one of the results of Bishop <a href=\"/biographies/every_edward\">EVERY</a>'s scheme to divide the South America region into two dioceses. Blair was named as the new Bishop of the Falkland Islands, with episcopal oversight of Anglicans in the Falkland Islands, Tierra del Fuego, Chile, Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador and part of the States of Colombia. He based himself in Valparaiso, in Chile. The task Blair faced proved to be too much for him. The reduced diocese for which he was responsible seriously lacked financial resources, so he was forced in 1911-12 to return to England to look for funds. In 1912 he wrote to <em>The Times </em>threatening to resign unless £100,000 was raised. But the response did not match his hopes. He returned to South America but resigned in 1914. During the war years, 1914-19, the Diocese of the Falkland Islands returned to the jurisdiction of Bishop Every, until the appointment of Norman de <a href=\"/biographies/jersey_norman\">JERSEY</a> as fourth bishop.</p><p>Blair was unfortunate in not having the personal wealth of Bishop Every to support his work.

        "body": "<p>young writer, was born in England, the third child and second daughter of Robert <a href=\"/biographies/blake_robert\">BLAKE</a> and Dorothea (Dora) Blake, née Herford. Dora had taken her two older children to England in late 1885 in advance of her husband who had remained behind in the Falklands to complete the season's work. Bridget was born at Bridge, the Blake home in Somerset, in July 1886. Over the years the Blakes had a total of eight children, four boys and four girls. Their mother had trained as a teacher and was a very talented water colourist, so the children did not lack for education. She was a strict disciplinarian, and the children had their own chores to do, besides school work. They spent their early childhood years growing up in great freedom at Hill Cove on West Falkland.</p><p>At school in England, aged about twelve, Bridget wrote a small booklet, illustrated with photographs, to explain the very different life she had lived. The house (still inhabited today) is described, as are the additions to it required as the family grew. The valley to the west of the house where the gardens were is described, and there in the shelter the children played many games, including 'hairdressers' using grass clumps as customers. Their father had his tree nursery down in the valley, and the children their own small gardens. Bridget was very knowledgeable about the wild plants to be found, and those which were edible.</p><p>When the year's stores arrived there was great excitement as the children were allowed to help with the unpacking, and Bridget records that: 'Once a glass jar of French Plums had been broken on the voyage from England and we were allowed to have the plums for provisions in the Fort we were building up on the hill'. The simplicity of the children's lives is emphasised by Bridget's description of the Cottage, a playhouse made by their father, which had a small door at the front and a window at the back, with a ladder set against the side so they could climb on to the roof. Their chief treasures were kept here: 'an old coffee-pot, two or three chipped cups and saucers, a shiny blue sugar bowl, an earthen jar discovered in the middle of a gorse hedge when we were looking for hens' nests'.</p><p>By 1891 Dora thought that it was time to take her children back to school in England. The two eldest were getting beyond the stage where she could teach them for all subjects. She also felt that her daughters were running wild, for where in England would one find girls careering about bareback on a pony, or excitedly lassoing a pig? Her husband was less certain, and it was with mixed feelings that he kept to the agreement they had made. He had for some time been promising Dora that the whole family would make their home in Somerset if they could rent a suitable house; they could not afford to buy with so many children to educate. Dora and the five children, with Miss Firmin their governess, sailed in early 1892 for England, and were joined in June by Robert, by which time another daughter had been born. Robert left again four months later to oversee work at the estancia near San Julian,and to visit Hill Cove, and was not to return until February 1894. By this time it became obvious to Blake that he could not afford to keep his large family in England so, leaving the two eldest behind with Dora's sister, they returned to the Falklands for four years.</p><p>The children all learned to ride, for it was the only way to get from place to place. They had a long-suffering pony, Snipe, who lived in the house paddock, so was always available. Bridget says: 'When we were little, if we were going for a picnic, the things to eat would be packed in saddlebags and fastened on Snipe; the baby sat in front, and the older children took it in turns to ride behind and hold it on'. There is a photograph of Bridget as a girl with her horse, dressed in baggy trousers, gaiters and short boots.</p><p>In March 1898 they left the Islands for the last time. It seems that Bridget never returned, though her parents and sister Violet did as they were taken off the <em>Oravia </em>when she was wrecked on the Billy Rock in 1912. The <em>Falkland Islands Magazine </em>of March 1911 noted 'Miss Bridget Blake of Hill Cove has taken First Class Honours in English Literature at Oxford'. Bridget went on to teach at Ladybarn House in Manchester, a school run by her mother's sister, which had been started by her grandfather Herford. Little is known of the rest of her life, though she taught at Penarth in Wales and retired there. She and Violet became Christian Scientists in middle life which must have caused some comment in the family as they had been raised as Unitarians, just as all the Blakes were. Bridget died in 1956. <em>Bridget's Book </em>was published by the Alastair Cameron Memorial Trust in 2002.</p>",

        "body": " <p>colonist, was born in Taunton, Somerset in 1851, the fifth child of nine of William Blake and Fanny Follet Osler Blake, née Browne, a strong Unitarian family with a background in medicine, law and farming. He was a resolute and adventurous young man, the lively one of the family whose restlessness got him involved in conflict with authority and with fellow students at boarding school where he chafed at the discipline. A short period in Munich studying engineering was followed by further engineering studies in Manchester in 1871 but the profession did not appeal to him and he returned home to Somerset the following year. It <em> </em>was at that stage that an event occurred which was to transform his life. In March 1873 the Colonial Manager of the Falkland Islands Company, Frederick <a href=\"/biographies/cobb_arthur\">COBB</a>, himself only 27, <em> </em>arrived from the Falkland Islands to marry Blake's sister Emily. Cobb had assumed his important and prestigious position at the remarkably young age of 22 and he regaled the family with stories of his life in the remote islands and the challenges faced by the early settlers. He suggested to Blake that he should accompany the newly married couple and try his hand at sheep farming, initially at the Company's principal farm at Darwin and later to explore opportunities for farming in his own right. This idea greatly appealed to Blake and with the blessing of his parents he sailed to the Falklands on 9 May 1873.</p><p>Following a few days in Stanley Blake rode with Cobb to Darwin to spend a few months there as a cadet. Meanwhile, Ernest <a href=\"/biographies/holmested_ernest\">HOLMESTED</a>, a pioneer sheep farmer on West Falkland, visited Stanley where he was impressed with the hospitality and welcome of the Cobbs and particularly of Emily, a charming and thoughtful hostess. Learning of Blake's ambitions he invited him to Shallow Bay, West Falkland. Blake arrived there in mid December 1873 and was immediately plunged into the busy farming season, with fine weather and different landscape from Lafonia, providing him with the stimulation and outlet for his energy which he had been seeking. An opportunity soon arose for him to invest in farmland when Holmested's partner Rees decided to sell his interest and offered it to Blake. He accepted with alacrity and on 31 January 1874 he became the partner of Ernest Holmested in what was to become a highly successful sheep farm and an enduring and harmonious relationship between the two families lasting more than a century.</p><p>Holmested was impressed with Blake, his drive and ability to handle men, but decided to test him out by leaving him in charge for a couple of months despite his youth, being just 23. The plan was fully successful despite Blake's apprehension. The development of West Falkland for sheep farming took place later than on the East and there was much to do for the two men: new livestock to be imported, new buildings to be erected, a workforce to be recruited and stabilised and fencing and land improvements to be carried out. It is surprising that these two young men should share a small dwelling with relative equanimity despite their differences in outlook. They were reputed to be the hardest workers on West Falkland. They survived the vicissitudes of the wool market, probably with help from home, and on 14 March 1880 Robert sailed for Stanley by schooner en route to England and the family home in Somerset. During his visit he stayed with the Herford family in Manchester, also Unitarians, whom he had got to know during his engineering course, and whilst there proposed marriage to the elder daughter Dorothea who was two years his junior. They were not to marry, however, until 14 July 1881 mainly because Holmested's own marital arrangements had taken precedence. The couple arrived at Shallow Bay on 26 November 1881, having journeyed from Montevideo on a Kosmos Line ship, and soon got to work on their new home at Hill Cove which was to be the principal settlement of the farm for over 100 years. By 1888 the farm was shearing 25,000 sheep and Blake had enhanced his reputation for breeding rams. Other matters such as land drainage needed constant attention, much of the work being carried out by contract workers from the West Country. Blake was a pioneer of forestry in the Falklands and indeed it was his abiding hobby. During the 1890s he planted Corsican Pine and Southern Beech at Hill Cove and in the 1920s he extended his plantations with the help of James <a href=\"/biographies/reid_james\">REID</a> from Kew Gardens.</p><p>The Blakes had eight children: Elsie (b1882), Robert (b1884), Bridget <a href=\"/biographies/blake_bridget\">BLAKE</a> (b1886), Violet (b1887), Willie (b1890), Dorothy (b1892), Arthur (b1894) and Norman (b1896). Following the successful appointment of Sydney Miller as farm manager, Blake returned to Somerset early in 1892. He had delayed his own return to look at prospects in San Julian, Argentina where two former shepherds were struggling to establish sheep farms and had asked for his help, particularly with capital for livestock and buildings. A shipment of sheep had already been successfully made to San Julian and Blake was determined to view the surrounding land before committing himself to invest. The two shepherds had leased land and Blake, approving of the sheltered valley they were farming, agreed to enter into partnership with them whilst initiating the purchase of the land. Following his return to England he became involved in ordering the materials for San Julian and realised that he needed to supervise the work. He left for the Falklands late in the year, arriving just before Christmas and planning to spend a few weeks <em> </em>there before leaving for San Julian where his experience and organisational skills would be needed if the venture was to be established on a more commercial basis. His stay at Hill Cove, though brief, was most enjoyable <em> </em>because he could relax in the knowledge that the farm was being managed by the highly competent Sydney Miller. At this time Blake became involved with other sheep farmers in a bitter confrontation over the plans of Governor <a href=\"/biographies/goldsworthy_sir\">GOLDSWORTHY</a> (instructed by the Colonial Office) for land reform, with Blake joining his fellow farmers in refusing to serve as a Justice of the Peace. Hill Cove, as with many other farms, was at the time held under a government lease and the possibility that the lease would not be renewed following many years of physical struggle and capital investment was strongly resented. It is interesting in the light of current land developments that Blake, when expressing his relief at the subsequent lease renewals, stated that the prevailing view among the workforce was that if the land were subdivided the small farmers would employ less labour and the men would be worked harder.</p><p>There is no doubt that Blake enjoyed the new challenge he faced at San Julian although he increasingly missed his wife and family. He also missed the hilly landscape of West Falkland, disliking the flat plains of Patagonia. He became physically involved in the construction of farm buildings such as a wool shed and dip, there being no other outlet for his energies. He returned to England in February 1894 where, after a short while in Manchester where Emily Cobb had settled with her children near to her own family, they returned to Paignton. Blake became increasingly restless to return to Hill Cove however, and pleading financial difficulty in keeping a large family in England following substantial investment in Patagonia persuaded Dora to return with him, leaving the two elder children at boarding school. They returned to the Islands in October but his return to Hill Cove was beset with problems which would not have been resolved by lesser men than Robert Blake and Sydney Miller. Miller's appointment had been outstandingly successful and he had moved with his wife and young <em> </em>child into the house vacated by the Blakes so that the latter faced disruption to both their home and working lives.</p><p>The question of the lease renewal had been discussed with Blake by the Colonial Office shortly before he left England and he was advised that the lease would be renewed subject to the surrender of 10,000 acres of land at Coast Ridge. However, the land reform ideas collapsed and leases were renewed. It was at this stage that the unique solidarity of West Falkland farmers was probably born, manifesting itself not only in farming matters but in such issues as medical and mail services. Blake had promised his wife that they would return to England in 1898 to settle and although he was sorely tempted to accept an invitation from FE Cobb, his brother-in-law and the managing director of the Falkland Islands Company, to manage the company's farms, he declined but consented to spend a few months at Darwin to formulate plans. They were well received, and culminated in Blake being invited to join the board in London upon his return. From that time onwards until the Company was taken over in 1972 there was always a Blake on the board, and they made regular visits to San Julian, Hill Cove and the Company farms. Today the Blake family is still represented in the Falklands although Hill Cove farm has been sold and subdivided.</p>",

        "body": " <p>farm manager, was born at San Julian, Argentina, a family farm, on 2 June 1918, the son of Robert Blake and Edith Maclagen Blake, née Wedderburn. Educated at Eton and Cambridge University he put his name down for the Colonial Service whilst still studying, a somewhat surprising decision in view of his family's extensive farming interests in the Falkland Islands and South America but understandable in the context of that service being considerably depleted by enlistment in the forces following the outbreak of war in 1939, and there being an elder brother. He began his Colonial Service in 1940, following a spell in the Royal Artillery, by being sent as a district officer to Sekondi in the Gold Coast {Ghana}, travelling from village to village, often on foot, accompanied by a cook and a Ghanaian clerk whom he highly regarded. He warmed to the cheerful local people and learnt their language. One of his posts was that of receiver of wrecks, a responsibility which was enhanced by the war which led to boats being washed ashore from time to time. Blake was warmly regarded by the native population and when he left a prominent citizen pledged to fund a return journey. He left the Gold Coast and the Colonial Service because his elder brother Robert, an RAF pilot, was killed on active service during the war and the family turned to him to manage the Holmested Blake Farm at Hill Cove, West Falkland, following the imminent retirement of Hugh <a href=\"/biographies/harding_hugh\">HARDING</a>. He arrived soon after the war ended and served as a cadet from 1947 until assuming the managership for the 1952-3 season.</p><p>It was not an easy succession because Harding was a highly popular manager and the change resulted in one or two resignations, notably that of the foreman. There was much to do on the farm because of neglect following the depression of the 1930s which was followed by World War II when there was a severe shortage of materials. A programme was put in place involving the replacement of houses and modernisation and the erection of a recreation hall and schoolroom, all built with local labour. Upon his return from a first leave in Britain, Blake brought back a cine projector and films which proved so popular that other farms followed his example and Government then established a film library.</p><p>Blake's basic shyness concealed a deep concern and regard for the welfare of the people of Hill Cove. Not fully happy with inherited wealth, he settled most of his shares in the Company on long-standing employees following his retirement. He was an innovative and successful manager who increased wool production and was held in high regard by Hill Cove people. In 1965, he handed over management of the farm to his cousin LG (Tim) <a href=\"/biographies/blake_lionel\">BLAKE</a> and returned to England where he became Farms Director of the Falkland Islands Company in London in which capacity he visited the Islands in alternate years.</p><p>He married Doreen Dulcie Workman in 1942 but the marriage did not survive the move to the Falkland Islands and ended in 1955. Blake married Susan Copleston in 1966, a very happy and successful union which, during their time at Richmond, Surrey, became a welcoming focal point for visiting Islanders. He resigned from the Board of Directors of the Falkland Islands Company in 1978 having been unable to reconcile himself to the loss of independence of the Company following a succession of takeovers which began in 1972. He died at Yeovil, Somerset, on 17 January 1998.</p>",

        "body": "<p>architect, was born at Fulham Palace, Middlesex, on 6 March 1829, fourth son of Charles Blomfield, Bishop of London and his wife, Dorothy, née Cox. Following education at Rugby School and Trinity College, Cambridge, he graduated with a BA in 1851 and MA in 1853. He was then articled for three years to the architect to the Bank of England, Philip Hardwick. During 1856 Blomfield set up in independent architectural practice in London and rapidly developed a significant ecclesiastical practice through his family connections. He was a prolific architect whose primary activity was church building and restoration, his favourite style being English perpendicular which he considered particularly suitable for church designs.</p><p>He married, firstly, Caroline Smith (daughter of Charles Case Smith) in 1860 and they had two sons, Charles and Arthur, (both b1863). Caroline died in 1882 and in 1887 he married Sara, the daughter of Matthew Ryan.</p><p>Blomfield became a fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1867 and was made vice-president in 1886, after which he was awarded the Institute's royal gold medal. In 1883 he was appointed architect to the Bank of England, elected an associate of the Royal Academy in 1888, and knighted in 1889. He was active overseas and designed, among other church buildings, Christ Church Cathedral in Stanley. Bishop <a href=\"/biographies/stirling_waite\">STIRLING</a> raised £3,000, Queen Victoria gave £30 and the Islanders were expected to raise the other £3,000 needed for the building costs</p><p>Blomfield's plans of the Cathedral were brought by Bishop Stirling to the Islands in August 1889 and unanimously approved. It is reported that they were the same as the plans which were drawn up by the original architect, John Oldred Scott, 'only much reduced in massiveness' to cut costs. They included a square tower facing the harbour.  Working drawings were then to be prepared and the plans were sent back to England for this to take place. Cut stone, lime and wood for the Cathedral were exported from Britain and a ship was chartered to bring out this material. (This ship is reported to be the <em>Lady Elizabeth </em>, now wrecked in Stanley harbour, but the story is not confirmed.)</p><p>Work was begun under the supervision of Vinnell, one of Blomfield's most able clerks of works, towards the end of 1889. Two bricklayers were sent out by the Bishop's son-in-law Robinson, to erect the building with the aid of local labour.  In May 1890 work came to a standstill when some of the local masons gave notice that they would no longer work unless they were paid 12/6d a day - they had been receiving 1/- an hour when working.  The strike delayed progress by two or three months.</p><p> Bishop Stirling laid the foundation stone on 6 March 1890 and, although uncompleted and without an organ, the consecration of the Cathedral by the Bishop took place on Sunday 21 February 1892. Work then left to be completed included the tower and the ten foot high timber dado. The vestry also required some attention and only about half of the required seats had been provided.  An organ, made in Dublin and costing £270, was brought to the Islands by the honorary canon the Rev Aspinall and his wife in December 1892 and erected in the course of the next few weeks, to be completed and played for the first time on Sunday 22 January 1893.</p><p>The tower was completed in 1903 by Austrian stone masons following the decision to reduce its designed height by twenty feet to stand at ninety feet. The object was to gain stability, but there were also savings in material and labour. Although the original estimated cost of the building was £6,000, by the time it was completed this had risen to over £12,000. The Cathedral has become a Stanley landmark, the home of numerous memorials and the site for the solemn occasions of Falklands history.</p><p>Sir Arthur Blomfield died suddenly at the Royal Societies Club in London on 30 October 1899 and was buried at Broadway, Worcestershire, on 3 November.  His second wife, Sara, survived him.</p><p><a href=\"/biographies/stirling_waite\">See Image 331</a></p>",

        "body": " <p>with Operation Tabarin*, was born in Stanley on 31 October 1923, son of Alexander Latto Blyth and Christine Agnes, née Dickson. He spent most of his childhood in Stanley. In January 1944, as a member of the Falkland Islands Defence Force, he heard that a team of British scientists needed a cook for an Antarctic expedition. He immediately volunteered, as a relief from the sentry duty in which he was mainly engaged. He found himself a member of the then secret Royal Navy Operation 'Tabarin', launched to safeguard British sovereignty in the Falkland Island Dependencies (now British Antarctic Territory).</p><p>Sailing from Stanley in HMS <em>William Scoresby </em>in March 1944, Blyth joined the nine man party at Port Lockroy (Wiencke Island, Danco Coast), where they established a base known as Bransfield House. Although he had been engaged as cook, in fact he acted only as cook's assistant, for much of the cooking was taken over by the stores officer, old (47) Tom Berry, who had served as chief steward in RRS <em>Discovery  </em>before the war. In the best Antarctic tradition, Blyth adapted himself to the role of handyman, assisting in all the activities at the base, including carpentry, photographic work, and collection of scientific specimens.</p><p>Blyth returned to Stanley in December 1944 and, the following month, sailed south again for a further year, bound this time for Hope Bay, Trinity Peninsula, where he was a member of a 13 man party, working hard to establish a new base, known as Eagle House. Again he found himself as Berry's assistant in the kitchen and as handyman about the base, with the chance to take part in a few short sledge journeys with the newly arrived dog teams. He later recalled that on 8 May 1945 (VE Day) he heard George VI and Churchill on the radio, and drank a toast to the end of the war in Europe. He was a good man to have at base on such an occasion, and on party nights, for he played the accordion and had a good singing voice, although not everyone appreciated his crooning in Bing Crosby style!</p><p>Blyth returned to Stanley in January 1946. However, he had not finished with the Antarctic, for, towards the end of 1947, he signed on for a further year with the FIDS, returning to Port Lockroy as handyman in a four man party. His final year in the south was not without adventure. He achieved a record fast descent of Jabet Peak, above Port Lockroy, when a slip on ice launched him down the mountain at a speed that safely carried him over a four foot wide crevasse. On another occasion, he and two others from the base rowed over to the neighbouring Doumer Island for a one night visit, and then found their return cut off by drifting sea ice. As a precaution, they killed two seals to augment their food and fuel, but they had no radio to tell the base leader, alone at base, of their predicament. On the sixth day a change of wind dispersed the ice, and they were able to row home, to the intense relief of the base leader.</p><p>After his return from the Antarctic in early 1949, Blyth worked until his retirement in various jobs, including lighthouse-keeping, gardening and shepherding in Camp and Stanley and, for four years in the l970s, in the United Kingdom as a security guard. He looked back on his Antarctic years as the happiest of his working life, among some of the best friends he ever made. He was justly proud to receive the Polar Medal (with Antarctic clasp 1944-45) in 1953, and of being later commemorated in Blyth Spur, on James Ross Island. He also received the Long Service Medal of the Falkland Islands Defence Force.</p><p>He married his first wife, Hilary Maud McGill, at the Tabernacle in Stanley on 12 October 1949. They had two children, Gail (b1950) and Colin John (b1954). He married his second wife Paz Neri Igao from the Philippines in August 1985. With her, he visited the Philipines for the first time in the last year of his life. He died in Stanley on 1 May 1995.</p>",

Her father, Percy Reginald Bolus MD, was Falkland Islands physician with the British Colonial Office, as well as magistrate, customs officer and registrar-general. Her mother was a native Islander, Viola Constance Bolus, fourth child of James John <a href=\"/biographies/felton_john\">FELTON</a> and Sarah (Turner) Felton. She moved to England before the birth of her brother and sister, being educated at Bedales and Sydenham High School, matriculating from Clarks College. In 1926 her father was posted to Ottawa, Canada. Malvina Bolus held secretarial positions in the House of Commons, serving as personal secretary to Canada's first woman member of parliament, Agnes Macphail, from 1928 to 1936. In 1936 the two participated in a study trip through Scandinavia and Stalin's USSR. The next year, in a widely reported seven-month tour, she and a cousin drove around the United States demonstrating a large caravan.</p><p>In 1939, Malvina Bolus returned to London as personal assistant to the senior Canadian generals in Canadian Military Headquarters. In 1944 she was appointed private secretary to the Head of the London Mission of the US Office of Scientific Research and Development, moving in 1945 to New York, where she worked under Vannevar Bush and subsequently took a secretarial position with the Kellogg Foundation. In 1946 she returned to Ottawa as editorial assistant for the Canadian Geographical Society, becoming assistant editor of the <em>Canadian Geographical Journal </em>in 1948. A lifelong active member of the Canadian Women's Press Club, she compiled the first photographic anthology of Canadian landmarks and landscapes, <em>Image of Canada  </em>(1953). Bolus moved to the Hudson's Bay Company in Winnipeg, editing its magazine <em>The Beaver </em>from 1957 to 1972. She was noted for her exhaustive editorial checking, maintaining an exacting standard of 'total detailed accuracy' as well as writing several noteworthy articles. Under her editorship <em>The Beaver </em>became one of North America's foremost historical publications - its 1967 special issue, <em>Eskimo Art, </em>was reissued as a book. In 1972, she edited the anthology <em>People and Pelts. </em>Malvina Bolus made numerous excursions to the Canadian Arctic, where she acquired an exceptional collection of Inuit (Eskimo) art and was influential in arousing interest in the subject. She received a number of Canadian and American awards, including the Canadian Historical Association's 1961 Order of Merit, and in 1970 was one of 27 Canadians honoured by the Governor-General with the Medal of Service of the Order of Canada. In 1972, she retired to Victoria, British Columbia. She remained active in historical, natural history, and geographical societies, and travelled to Central and South America, the Orient, and New Zealand. Though she never returned to her birthplace, she maintained a lifelong interest in the Falklands, holding shares in the Falkland Islands Company and entertaining the Islands' athletes at the 1994 Victoria Commonwealth Games. She continued corresponding with her Falklands relatives until her death in 1997. Malvina Bolus was 'an extraordinary person who has made a great contribution to Canada.'</p>",

        "body": "<p>surveyor, mathematician and eccentric, was born of English parents in the Himalayan foothills at Dehra Dun, India, on 17 January 1927. His father was geodesist Guy Bomford, an officer in the Royal Engineers attached to the Survey of India, and his mother was Audrey Edith, née Barclay. In 1934 his parents divorced. His mother married Charles Trigg and had a second son, Nicholas. His father married Annette Brown, with whom he had two more sons, Rodney and Christopher. Bomford went to Shrewsbury School in England and immediately after leaving school in 1944 joined the Royal Engineers, who supported his engineering and mathematics studies at Pembroke College (Cambridge), where he achieved first class honours. In the late 1940s and early 1950s Bomford led several expeditions for the British Schools Exploring Society to northern Quebec, Iceland, and Finnish Lapland. In 1951 he married Adelaide-born Elizabeth Ann Honey. He worked for the British Overseas Survey in Tanganyika {Tanzania} from 1953 to 1955.</p><p>Bomford was the chief surveyor on Duncan <a href=\"/biographies/carse_verner\">CARSE</a>'s eight man expedition to South Georgia of September 1955 - April 1956. This was one of the highlights of Bomford's life. With him he took a remarkably durable homemade tent which he himself had made, stitching the tent's French seams on a Singer sewing machine bought with money given to him and his wife on their wedding. During six months on South Georgia he and his companions surveyed the whole island, often in most unsympathetic weather, manhauling sledges of surveying gear and living in tents. The resulting map of the island established a new standard in Antarctic mapping, for which he won the 1957 Ness Award of the Royal Geographical Society. For more than 40 years since then it has been the definitive map of the island.</p><p>His time on South Georgia was so successful that the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey (later British Antarctic Survey) invited Bomford to return to South Georgia as leader of an overwintering expedition to Marguerite Bay. He declined this offer in order to spend time with his wife and children, who eventually numbered four - Richard (b1952), Mary (b1953), Philip (b1960) and Annabel (b1964).</p><p>After working for the Australian Army Survey Corps (1958-60) and in Britain with the Ordnance Survey, he settled in Australia in 1961 and joined the Division of National Mapping. He was President of the Institute of Surveyors, Australia (1975-76) and Director of National Mapping (1977-82). From 1974, inspired by the work of MC Escher, he made hooked rugs with mathematical themes, two of which are now in the National Gallery of Australia in Canberra. Bomford retired early, aged 55, in 1982. Among his many journeys after that time, was one aboard Jerome Poncet's 20 metre ice-strengthened schooner <em>Golden Fleece </em>during its 1998 circumnavigation of South Georgia. He died of cancer in Canberra on 10 May 2003, attended by his family and Jenny Chapman, companion on many adventures in his last ten years. His papers are now in the National Library of Australia.</p><p>Bomford was 'essentially a restless, irrepressible adventurer' - an eccentric, a renaissance man and a generous person. He had a healthy imagination, great sense of humour and immense interest in other people, and was stimulating (and sometimes exhausting) company. His early work with young people through the British Schools Exploring Society is commemorated by the Bomford Prize for 'youthful endeavour', first awarded by the Government of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands in 2005. Eleven hundred and forty metre (3744ft) Bomford Peak on South Georgia (54°08'S, 37°38'W) is named after him, as is Mount Bomford (15°45'S, 125°55'E) in the Kimberleys, northern Western Australia, another feature which he mapped.</p>",

He began his military career on 28 April 1768 by joining the army as an  <em>alférez </em>in his native Plasencia. Bonavía transferred to the navy on 13 April 1782 as an  <em>alférez de navío </em>, although retaining his army rank. First he was given time to study mathematics at the Royal Military Academy of Barcelona. After various appointments, both ashore and afloat, Bonavía was promoted to  <em>teniente de navío </em>on 21 September 1789, by which time he had seen action at the blockade of Gibraltar and in South American waters against the Portuguese.</p><p>Following peace being signed with Britain, he was sent in the brig  <em>Paloma </em>to the River Plate, where he was appointed in command of the corvette  <em>Descubierta </em>and sent to the Spanish establishment in Puerto de la Soledad (Port Louis)to act as <em>comandante gobernador, </em>taking over from Ramón Fernández on 31 March 1802 and serving in this post until 21 July 1803 when he was relieved by Antonio <a href=\"/biographies/leal_de\">LEAL</a>. Bonavía returned to Puerto de la Soledad for a second term as governor, taking over from Leal in mid March 1804 until relieved, again by Leal, on 21 March 1805. Bonavía returned to Puerto de la Soledad for a third term as governor, taking over from Leal on 20 March 1806, serving there until the end of August 1808, when he was relieved by Gerardo <a href=\"/biographies/bondas_gerardo\">BONDAS</a>. In June 1807 provisions in the settlement almost ran out, new supplies only arriving on the day the last daily rations, consisting of six ounces of bread and some salt meat per person, had been issued. As Bonavía pointed out to the viceroy, the timely arrival was most fortunate as it was the height of winter when temperatures were extremely low. He added that the settlement now had supplies of flour for six months, dry pulses for fourteen months, dried beef and pork and wine also for six months. On 16 August 1808 Bonavía reported that there were 215 cattle of all ages in the settlement, mostly kept in corrals, and 828 horses of all ages, some of which were tame and presumably broken. This extended third term may have been caused by the British attacks on Buenos Aires and Montevideo in 1807. It also made Bonavía the Spanish governor with the longest accumulated period in this post. During his third term as governor Bonavía wrote to Viceroy Rafael, Marqués de Sobre Monte, on 6 July 1807 to assure him that he was prepared to defend the settlement and resist any invasion. He was also willing to accept a delayed replacement. This eventually occurred on 17 April 1808 when he was relieved by Bondas in command of the brig  <em>Nuestra Señora de Belén. </em>During his first term as governor Bonavía was promoted  <em>capitán de fragata </em>on 5 October 1802, serving in that rank until his retirement in 1811. <em> </em></p><p>Bonavia's wife, Cipriana Obes, was sister to Dionisia Obes, married to Jorge <a href=\"/biographies/pacheco_jorge\">PACHECO</a>, who in turn interested Louis <a href=\"/biographies/vernet_louis\">VERNET</a> in the Falkland Islands. <em> </em></p>",

This may have been due to a dearth of executive branch officers in the Montevideo naval command at the time, as Bondas was not a career naval officer nor did he belong to the <em>Cuerpo de Pilotos  </em>of the Spanish navy. Another factor may have been his acquaintance with the Falklands, having been sent there in 1796, during <a href=\"/biographies/aldana_y\">ALDANA</a>'s governorship, in command of the brig <em>Carmen y Ánimas </em>, when she was nearly wrecked following a severe gale, and once again in 1805, during Antonio <a href=\"/biographies/leal_de\">LEAL</a>'s governorship, when, in command of the brig <em>Nuestra Señora de Belén,  </em>he assisted in salvaging goods from the wrecked <em>San Agustín </em>. It seems likely that he made other unrecorded voyages to Puerto de la Soledad with stores and to carry out the routine yearly cruises round the islands. On 10 March 1808 he sailed once again from Montevideo in command of the brig <em>Nuestra Señora de Belén  </em>to take up his appointment as governor for the first of two terms that ran consecutively until he was relieved by Pablo <a href=\"/biographies/guillen_martinez\">GUILLÉN MARTÍNEZ</a> on 8 January 1810. One of his first tasks was to check with Bonavía the latter's all important report to the viceroy on livestock in the colony, particularly the number of cattle and horses. Well aware of the momentous events that were taking place around the River Plate and in the Iberian Peninsula, Bondas maintained the continuity of Spanish presence in the Falklands reporting regularly to the viceroy in Buenos Aires on all aspects of the colony's administration. On 1 July 1809 Bondas submitted to Viceroy Santiago de Liniers the prescribed report on the colony's defences, stating that the gun carriages which Bonavía had reported as useless had been turned into firewood and the mountings into forge iron. Significantly, shortly after leaving the governorship of Puerto de la Soledad, Bondas was appointed an <em>alférez de fragata </em>in the Spanish Navy.</p>",

        "body": " <p>landowner, was born at San Carlos on 11 March 1929 to John Francis (Jack) <a href=\"/biographies/bonner_john1\">BONNER</a> and Vickey Bonner, daughter of RB <a href=\"/biographies/baseley_reginald\">BASELEY</a>. His early years were spent at San Carlos and his primary education was carried out by his mother and was to prepare him for entry to his preparatory school in England, where he went in 1939. However war intervened and the family returned from England in 1939, so Christopher was not left at school as was planned. In 1941 he was sent to St George's College in Buenos Aires where he was to remain until 1947. He was captain of the school for his last term. As the school was run on English public school lines he was able to achieve the necessary passes in the School Certificate and Higher School Certificate Examinations to enter Queens' College, Cambridge in October 1948. He graduated in 1951 and subsequently attained Master of Arts in 1956. He also obtained the Certificate of Proficiency in Agriculture.</p><p>In 1952, he returned to the Falklands and worked as assistant manager to his father at San Carlos until May 1954<em>. </em>He then went to New Zealand in October of that year and worked on a variety of properties in the South Island gaining valuable sheep-farming experience. In early 1956 he had to return to the Falklands to take over the management of San Carlos as his father, Jack Bonner, had become seriously ill with heart disease. Later that year he returned to New Zealand to marry Marguerite, eldest daughter of Geoffrey Dixon, of Holton, Kaiapoi, near Christchurch. The couple returned to the Falklands in October 1956 and for the next 12 years managed San Carlos for the family sheep farming company, of which Bonner became Managing Director on the death of his father in 1958. During this time he endeavoured to carry out the good management principles laid down by his father and grandfather before him. Maintenance of high wool quality and efficient stock management were always top priority. To this end the importation of stud sires from New Zealand and the UK was continued with the establishment of the Corriedale as the preferred breed as opposed to the Romney of former years. Considerable subdivision to enable more efficient use of the pastures was also carried out. The welfare of the staff was not overlooked; three new dwelling houses were erected with modern facilities, electric power was laid on for the settlement and every shepherd's house was equipped with its own lighting plant. The cookhouse was also modernised with updated toilet facilities and the installation of central heating.</p><p>Four children were born during their time in the Islands: Sally (b1957), John (b1960) and finally twin daughters Katherine and Caroline (b1964).</p><p>Christopher Bonner was appointed a Justice of the Peace in 1957 and also served on various committees of the Sheepowners' Association. He was asked to run for election to the LegCo in 1960 and was elected Member for East Falkland. This was the last Council to have an official majority as during its term the ex officio seats were abolished giving the unofficial members a working majority. He ran for a second term but was replaced by Margery <a href=\"/biographies/vinson_marjorie\">VINSON</a> in 1964. However, he continued on Council as the nominated member for East Falkland. He was appointed to the ExCo in 1966 and became involved in the political crisis that year following a report of the Governor to the ExCo, upon his return from the United Kingdom, on the discussions which had taken place between Britain and Argentina on sovereignty. Bonner was one of four unofficial members of Council to break their oath of secrecy and to make a direct appeal to British parliamentarians. The appeal aroused public support and resulted in government assurances on the future of the Islands.</p><p>He did not seek re-election to either council in 1968. After much heart-searching, the family had made known their intention to return to New Zealand and they left San Carlos and the Falklands in 1968, thereby ending a family association of nearly 120 years. They settled in the Canterbury area of New Zealand and continued farming until Bonner's final retirement in 1997.</p><p><a href=\"/biographies/arrowsmith_sir\">See Image 12</a><br><a href=\"?q=node/63\">See Image 50</a></p>",

        "body": "<p>landowner, was born at Port Sussex on 23 October 1873, the second son of John <a href=\"/biographies/bonner_john\">BONNER</a> and Susan Bonner, née Reddy. He was educated privately at Southport where his parents had retired and enrolled at Liverpool University to study engineering. When the deaths of his elder brother, Harry and his father occurred in quick succession in 1891, he was obliged to leave his studies to go out to the Falklands to run the property at San Carlos. This he did with considerable success for 40 years until his final retirement in 1930. During his time the property was developed considerably, with fencing erected, housing improved and a new woolshed and cookhouse built in 1913 making the property one of the leading stations in the Islands. Livestock were not neglected and George Bonner built a considerable reputation as a judge and promoter of the Kentish Romney Marsh sheep which at that time was the principal breed of sheep in the Islands. He made several importations of stud rams from Kent and from New Zealand to improve the breed.</p><p>Bonner married Frances Anne Rigg, at Filey, Yorkshire in 1894. They returned to the Falklands in that year and lived at San Carlos off and on for the next 36 years. She was a keen gardener and it was due to her insistence on having shelter for her plants that the sod wall which still encloses the homestead garden at San Carlos was built. There were four children of their marriage, Kathleen (1895-1953), Muriel (1898-1989), Mildred (1902-1981) and John (Jack) <a href=\"/biographies/bonner_john1\">BONNER</a> (1905-1958) who succeeded his father as manager and subsequent owner of San Carlos in 1927.</p><p>George Bonner retired with his family to England in 1913 and bought a property in Harrogate. The main purpose of the move to England was to educate the family, and the farm was left under the management of his cousin Albert Bonner. George Bonner was in England throughout World War I, and being too old for active service he obtained a position with the Ministry of Munitions as supplier of scrap metal. This involved much travel about the country obtaining scrap for the manufacture of ordnance for the Army. The family was hit by the loss of his younger brother, Singleton, who died of wounds received at the battle of Etaples in 1917.</p><p>On his return to the Islands in 1919 he embarked on various projects to improve San Carlos. Housing was imported to improve living conditions for his staff, a hydraulic wool press was installed and he was also instrumental in introducing one of the first motor vehicles to the Islands. This was a Citroën-Kegresse half-tracked vehicle which had been developed by the Citroën Car Company of France to cross the Sahara. George imported one of these vehicles complete with driver in the mid 20s. Though not particularly reliable crossing the camp, it performed valuable service pulling a plough in subsequent pasture development round the settlement at San Carlos.</p><p>Bonner was a public-spirited man. He was a Justice of the Peace, a cathedral trustee, and served on ExCo from 1924-1930. In 1912 he agreed to make a paddock of land which was owned by San Carlos in the centre of Stanley available for the King Edward VII Memorial Hospital. In 1931 he was awarded an OBE in recognition of his services to the colony. But his letters show that he considered his highest honour was representing the colony at the Coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth in May 1937.</p><p>He was a genial man, fond of sport, a keen shot and a fisherman. He was also very fond of golf and though taking it up late in life, he became captain of his club in Harrogate. He had laid out a nine-hole course in one of the sheep paddocks behind the woolshed at San Carlos, which was to be the scene of many family games. He was devoted to the Falklands, was proud to be an Islander and continually promoted the Islands, their industry and their people. His obituary tells of him being universally liked and a good friend to many. He died at Droitwich, Worcestershire, on 13 February 1940, having suffered a stroke some months previously.</p>",

        "body": "<p>colonist, was born in Liverpool in 1825. He became a tanner by trade and was engaged by Samuel <a href=\"/biographies/lafone_samuel\">LAFONE</a> to go to the Falklands to supervise and hopefully improve the curing of cattle hides for export. At that time hides were the main export from the Colony, but due to poor preparation they were rotting during the voyage to the market in Britain and being condemned on arrival. Bonner arrived in the colony in 1850 and presumably achieved the purpose for which he was engaged as he continued in the Falkland Islands Company's employ and after three seasons at Darwin, or possibly Saladero, was appointed camp manager in 1854. He was to hold this position until he took up land on his own account at Port Sussex in 1861. He returned to Darwin after the then manager, William <a href=\"/biographies/rudd_john\">RUDD</a>, was murdered in the San Carlos river below Mt Usborne in 1864, to administer the Company's affairs for another two seasons, resigning finally in 1866.</p><p>In 1861 he had obtained a licence to kill 'wild bulls' over all land to the west of the San Carlos river and north of the Bodie Peak range of hills, comprising the sections Port Sussex, Bodie Peak, Campito and possibly Campo Verde. John Bonner was one of the five original licencees permitted to kill wild cattle. The others were Antonina <a href=\"/biographies/roxa_antonina\">ROXA</a>, the Falkland Islands Company, Andrez <a href=\"/biographies/the_pitaluga\">PITALUGA</a>, and Captain <a href=\"/biographies/packe_robert\">PACKE</a>. In 1868 he obtained a further licence to kill cattle over Third Corral section which covers the total area of what was to become the San Carlos land holding. A settlement was established at Port Sussex around where the existing house now stands and the farm was run from there until it was moved to the present location on San Carlos Water in the 1880s. When the land at Third Corral was acquired and the sheep flocks became established, a dip and a dwelling were erected and the sheep dipping was carried out there for several years before the settlement moved. John Bonner was a strong and intelligent man. According to family records he quickly adapted to colonial life, learning to ride and lasso cattle as well as any gaucho. He also must have acquired a working knowledge of Spanish which was very necessary in those days to deal with the gauchos who were the principal work force until the wild cattle were eliminated.</p><p>He married Susan Reddy, aged 17, in Stanley on 19 December 1866. She was the daughter of James Reddy, one of the Pensioners sent out to the Falklands in 1850. Both her parents died shortly after their arrival and she was brought up by foster parents in Stanley. They lived at Sussex and had a family of eight: Helen (b1868), Harry (b1869), Susan (b1871), George <a href=\"/biographies/bonner_george1\">BONNER</a> (b1873), Catherine (b1875), Gertrude (b l877), Singleton (b1879), and Elizabeth (b1883).</p><p>In 1884 John Bonner moved his family to England and settled in Birkdale, a suburb of Southport (Lancs) in order to educate his considerable family. His brother Sam was left in charge of San Carlos but John Bonner made frequent trips back for the seasons. About 1887 his eldest son, Harry, went back with his father to the Islands and was being trained up to take over the management. Sadly in April 1891 Harry contracted pneumonia and died, some weeks before his father who died in May. So George Bonner took over the management of San Carlos.</p><p>No records exist of John Bonner playing any part in the government or administrative side of life in the colony at that time. No doubt as camp manager for the FIC and one of the first landowners his opinions may have been sought from time to time. He was deeply religious, having connections with the Rev Carey Bonner, a well-known Victorian Baptist preacher, and was a devoted family man. He had prospered through his own endeavours, and his sudden death in 1891 came as a great shock to his young family, most of whom were still at school. San Carlos is still referred to as 'JB' after John Bonner (and in distinction to Port San Carlos, known as 'KC' after William Keith <a href=\"/biographies/cameron_william\">CAMERON</a>).</p>",

        "body": "<p>landowner, was born at San Carlos on 27 May 1905, the youngest child and only son of George <a href=\"/biographies/bonner_george1\">BONNER</a> and Frances, née Rigg. He grew up at San Carlos and received his early education from his mother and governesses. In 1913 when the family moved to England he was sent to Stanmore Park Preparatory School in North London and subsequently to Harrow School from 1918 to 1922. He returned to the Falklands in 1922 and after assisting his father for three seasons went to work as a cadet for the Patagonian Sheepfarming Company at Estancia Condor, Río Gallegos in Argentina. He was there during 1925 and 1926, returning to San Carlos after the 1926 season and taking over the management in 1927. In 1928 he married Vickey Baseley, daughter of RB <a href=\"/biographies/baseley_reginald\">BASELEY</a>, who had been director of public works in Stanley. They lived in San Carlos for the next 28 years until their retirement to Stanley in 1956. There were two children of the marriage, Christopher <a href=\"/biographies/bonner_george\">BONNER</a> (b1929) and Rosemary (1933-72).</p><p>Jack Bonner's life and main interest was the family property at San Carlos. He was an excellent stockman, a good horseman, and a keen sportsman. His main concern, however, was always to improve San Carlos. He ensured that the best breeding stock available was purchased and was in the forefront of the move into the Corriedale breed when it became apparent that the finer wool they produced yielded a better price. He participated in the import of stud rams from New Zealand, the UK and Chile and was immensely gratified when this investment was reflected in the wool prices which were consistently among the best in the Islands. He also imported pedigree pony stallions and stud bulls from England to improve breed of horses and cattle on the property. After the end of the war in 1945 and when materials became available, he spent considerable funds repairing and replacing old fencing and putting in new subdivisions to improve the stock-carrying capacity of the property and to make the gathering and mustering of stock easier. When funds allowed he improved living conditions for his employees. During his time running water and indoor sanitation were installed in every house on the station and several new houses of an improved standard were built.</p><p>Jack Bonner never really sought public office. He served his time on the Sheep Owners' Association committee, occasionally as joint chairman, and also served on the committee that met annually with the FI Labour Federation to sort out working agreements for each forthcoming season. He was elected to serve on the LegCo in 1950 as member for East Falkland. However, he resigned in 1951 due to a disagreement over Government policy and dissatisfaction over the Government's official majority on Council. He did not seek re-election. He was appointed to the ExCo in 1955 <em> </em>but had to resign due to ill health in 1956. He was reappointed by Governor <a href=\"/biographies/arthur_sir\">ARTHUR</a> in 1957 and was a councillor at the time of his death in 1958. He was appointed a Justice of the Peace in 1937 and was made a trustee of Christ Church Cathedral in succession to his father in 1940.</p><p>Jack Bonner was always concerned about the monoculture practised at the time in the Islands which placed so much dependence on the price of wool and the consequent heavy taxation burden on the farms. When in 1949 Governor <a href=\"/biographies/clifford_sir\">CLIFFORD</a> approached the Colonial Development Corporation about the possibilities of setting up a refrigeration plant for the processing of sheepmeat in the Islands, Jack Bonner gave the scheme his wholehearted support. He made land available at Ajax Bay for the plant and gave up much time as chairman of the local board of directors to attempt to get the enterprise going as an economic and viable concern. Its failure to operate economically and subsequent bankruptcy were a great disappointment to him.</p><p>Jack Bonner, as his father before him, was first and foremost a Falkland Islander. It was therefore a great honour for him when he and his wife were asked to represent the Falkland Islands at the 1951 Colonial Conference held in conjunction with the Festival of Britain. They were entertained for a fortnight in London and attended many meetings and receptions with the other delegates. His untimely death at the age of 53 deprived the colony of a very devoted resident who could have given the community many years of useful service, as he was looking forward to doing in his retirement.</p>",

        "body": "<p>zoologist, was born in Holloway, London on 15 February 1928, the second son of Frederick Bonner and Constance, née Hatch. He was educated at the Stationers' Company's School and University College, London where he studied zoology. He shared a laboratory balance with Jennifer Sachs, whom he later married. They had two children: Martin (b1958) and Lucy (b1962).</p><p>Bonner's interest had been entomology, especially beetles, and he had planned to work in East Africa, but in a life-changing decision he was beguiled into joining another classmate, Bernard Stonehouse, on an expedition to South Georgia. Stonehouse had persuaded Miles <a href=\"/biographies/clifford_sir\">CLIFFORD</a>, Governor of the Falkland Islands, to fund an expedition to study king penguins. In August 1953 the two men sailed on the whaling transport <em>Polar Maid </em>and on the night they arrived at Leith Harbour Bonner developed acute appendicitis. After a month in a fire-devastated hospital, he joined Stonehouse at FIDS base 'M', a garden shed nicknamed 'Shrillwillie Hall', erected at Paul Beach in the Bay of Isles. For 15 months, Bonner studied elephant seals while Stonehouse studied penguins.</p><p>After working up the results of his fieldwork and marrying Jennifer at Hampstead Registry Office in August 1955, Bonner returned to South Georgia in 1956 as government biologist and sealing inspector, charged with implementing a management plan which would successfully rescue the elephant seals from years of over-hunting. The job required accompanying the Norwegian sealing crews around the beaches of South Georgia and supervising the killing of seals under licence. To provide information on the seals' biology, large numbers were tagged and teeth taken from carcases were sectioned to assess their ages. A study of the fur seal, which was recovering from near extinction, became a subsidiary project and Bonner set up another garden shed, 'Bonner's Bothy', on Bird Island where the breeding population was concentrated. Bonner also made the first study of the introduced reindeer at South Georgia. The original one-year contract was extended to six years, and his wife and infant son joined Bonner for three years in one of the houses of the small administrative settlement at King Edward Point. The couple became fluent in Norwegian and made friends among the whalers, which enabled Bonner to gain a deep knowledge of South Georgia and its whaling industry. Einar STRAND, the long-serving blacksmith at Grytviken, became an unofficial <em>bestefar, </em>grandfather, to Martin Bonner.</p><p>From 1962 to 1967, Bonner was lecturer in zoology at Sir John Cass College and he then became director of the Natural Environment Research Council's Seals Research Unit. Starting with a team of three which included Bill Vaughan, his successor at South Georgia, he was responsible for rationalising the management of British grey and common seals, which were being hunted both for their skins and to protect fisheries. In 1974, Bonner became head of the Life Sciences Division of the British Antarctic Survey and he retired in 1988 as deputy director. These posts brought him back to South Georgia and he was able to regale a younger generation with tales of the now extinct way of life of the whalers and sealers. He became concerned with Antarctic environmental and conservation issues and was chairman of the Conservation Subcommittee of the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) from 1974 to 1992.</p><p>After retiring from BAS, Bonner became involved with South Georgia again. He accompanied a team which cleared some of the environmental hazards at the abandoned whaling stations where storms and vandalism had caused extensive damage. From this work sprang the concept of a Whaling Museum which, with funding from the South Georgia Government and the enthusiastic assistance of a small team, was set up in 1991 in the manager's house (Villa) at Grytviken. As Bonner wrote 'If [the museum] causes [visitors] to think a little more deeply about the whaling industry, the management of natural resources, and the society of whalers, I think we shall have achieved our objective'.</p><p>Bonner had many other interests. He served as president of the Mammal Society for a unique two terms, being awarded the Society's Silver Medal, and was active in the Zoological Society of London. In 1987 Bonner was awarded the Polar Medal for his Antarctic work. Most of Nigel Bonner's professional life was devoted to the study of seals and he is best known for his pioneering research on the fur seals of South Georgia and for placing the management of British seals on a firm basis. His early employment as a sealing inspector gave him a love of South Georgia that reached its final expression when he established the South Georgia Whaling Museum.</p><p>He died of a heart attack on 27 August 1994 at home in Godmanchester, Cambs; his ashes were later scattered at Bird Island, South Georgia. A beach in Larsen Harbour, South Georgia, where Weddell Seals breed, is named after him, as is the BAS laboratory at Rothera in the British Antarctic Territory.</p>",

Educated locally in elementary school and at the Wade Deacon Grammar School, Widnes, he trained as a teacher at Chester College. By this time World War II had broken out and he served as a chemist in a chemical defence research establishment for the duration. On release he taught in various schools of the Liverpool Education Department for five years. During this time, in 1946 he married Jessie Kay, a Hollerith machine operator (an early form of mechanical computing). He had great interest in the natural sciences, flowers, birds and wild life. Most of his vacations were spent in the mountains of the British Isles.</p><p>In 1951 he answered an advertisement for a teaching post in the Falklands and was accepted as a teacher in the Stanley Senior School. The school leaving age was fourteen, although there was a continuation class for those pupils who wished to continue for a further year. In the following years a science course was developed and in time a science laboratory was built and equipped. There was, of course, little or no road transport outside Stanley but expedi­tions to Kidney Island on the government harbour launch  <em>Alert </em>were enjoyed by groups of senior pupils. Booth and his wife walked along the Wickham Heights to Ajax Bay, living mostly on pemmican and porridge. In those days both staff and pupils were occupied in the summer months with gardens, peat-cutting and rickling*. It was possible to fish locally along the coasts (no minefields).</p><p>In 1964 he was appointed headmaster of the Stanley schools. In 1968 the age limit was raised to fifteen, giving the senior pupils the opportunity to extend their education. At that time there were few job opportunities in Stanley for girls. A few trained for nursing, but most available jobs were in domestic service, mainly with farm managers in Camp. With the extra year available Booth initiated a commercial course: book-keeping, shorthand and typing to RSA standard, with himself teaching book-keeping and his wife teaching shorthand and typing. The course proved very successful and many pupils passed the RSA examinations and found careers in various offices. In 1970 the school was badly damaged <em> </em>by fire, which meant that for several months some classes had to be held at 44 Davis Street while the main building was repaired. The frequent climbs up and down Davis Street/John Street each day were good for the wind if not for the limbs.</p><p>Booth retired in 1976 and then had a varied life acting as a locum for officers on leave. Among other positions, he served as harbour master, customs officer and central store officer. When Madge <a href=\"/biographies/biggs_madge\">BIGGS</a> retired he took over the position of librarian and also found himself almost overwhelmed with requests from a number of farms and small businesses in Stanley to deal with their bookkeeping and accountancy. It was not until he was eighty years old that he retired for the second time from all the further work he had taken on. In addition to other responsibilities, he and his wife Jessie were both active as JPs.</p><p>They now spend their time bird-watching, walking and gardening. They also make regular visits to Australia, to the family of their unofficially adopted daughter, Joan Halliday. They live at Racecourse Cottage in Stanley, their home for the past thirty years.</p>",

Dannie (junior) was one of four siblings, sisters Agnes and Cathie and brother Malcolm. He was also part of a large and closely-knit extended family to which his mother Mary was matriarch. He was educated at Govan High School and Glasgow University, graduating with a degree in mathematics. On leaving university, Borland joined the RAF and was commissioned in the meteorological branch of the RAF Volunteer Reserve. After the War, he worked as a met officer at Renfrew airport for a short time before on 13 October 1948 taking up the position of forecaster in the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey. He sailed from Southampton in November 1948 on the <em>John Biscoe </em>, as senior meteorological officer with a party of scientists bound for South Georgia. He returned to UK for a stint of leave in 1951, sailing south again on the <em>Southern Opal </em>on 15 Sept 1951. Following leave in 1953, he returned to South Georgia for a further tour of duty.</p><p>His position was made permanent and pensionable on 21 January 1954 and thereafter, apart from regular leave to the UK he remained on South Georgia as meteorological forecaster until March 1968. The acting colonial secretary reported on his visit to South Georgia in 1958: 'Borland is considered by the whalers to be a first-rate forecaster and he appears to be doing an excellent job. He is rather an odd character but seems to like South Georgia'. His leave passages home, on the most appropriate vessel sailing northward from South Georgia, always seemed to take a long time. The colonial secretary in the Falklands, Tommy <a href=\"/biographies/thompson_willoughby\">THOMPSON</a>, wrote to the Commissioner on South Georgia (DJ Coleman): 'Mr Borland apparently makes a habit of overstaying his leave; on analysis it would be wiser to say he never earns enough to cover the leave South Georgia circumstances force him to take'.</p><p>In 1967 the South Georgia Met Service went through an upheaval and Borland was asked to transfer to the Falklands. This he did, accepting the post of meteorological forecaster in April 1968. Thereafter he served continuously in the Falklands, rising to the position of senior forecaster and living at 15 Ross Road West. Because of his splendid forecasting, many of the then scattered community depended on his advice for weather-dependent activities, so he often received gifts of produce from grateful farmers. Visiting him, it was not unusual to see the carcass of his most recent gift of mutton lying in the bath waiting to be butchered!</p><p>On his 60th birthday, 1981, Borland confirmed he did not want to retire and went on leave to Buenos Aires in November of that year. He was traumatised by the Argentine invasion in early April 1982 and returned to the UK on 15 April, retiring in the same month. He had spent almost 15 years on South Georgia and 14 years in the Falklands, giving him an unparalleled knowledge of the weather and climate in the region. His outgoing and relaxed nature helped him make lifelong friends with many officers and crew from visiting ships. For many years he corresponded with them, also exchanging postage stamps with those who shared his interest in philately. He spoke fluent Norwegian, Russian and Spanish. In the Falklands his position brought him into contact with the Argentinian LADE pilots with whom he had an excellent working relationship. This may well have accentuated the shock of the conflict and the sense of betrayal he felt. He was well-read and travelled, good company, kindly and had a certain taciturn disposition towards authority. To be entertained to a meal in his house was an experience to be remembered. A somewhat unconventional, but friendly character (some might say eccentric), he remained single all his life. His many hobbies included stamp collecting (he had a fine collection of Falkland Island and South Georgia first day covers), photography, opera and classical music, science fiction novels and corresponding with his many friends worldwide. Above all, he was close to his extended family and during his leaves loved entertaining with his famous meals (gargantuan but messy) and regaling his many nieces and nephews with stories of his travels and adventures.</p><p>On leaving the Falklands, he at first retired to Dunoon, Argyll in 1983 then in 1993 he returned to Glasgow, where he lived at Shieldhall, some two miles from his original birthplace in Govan. He died peacefully on 22 December 2003.</p>",

        "body": "<p>French soldier, sailor, explorer, scholar and writer, was born on 12 November 1729 the youngest of four children of Pierre-Yves de Bougainville, a lawyer from a cultivated and well-connected professional family. Bougainville began his career in the French army and from October 1754 he spent nearly a year as a young man in London at the Court of St James in diplomatic duties and attending meetings of the Royal Society, to which he was elected a Fellow at the age of 27 after the publication of his  <em>Treatise on Integral Calculus </em>. Recalled to his regiment, he spent much of the Seven Years War in Canada, where he acted as  <em>aide de camp </em>to the Marquis de Montcalm, the French commander. He saw action against British forts, accompanied by French regular soldiers and their Indian allies, at whose cruelties, ferocity and insolence he shuddered. He was sent by Montcalm to Paris to ask King Louis XV for men and supplies to prosecute the war in Canada. Instead he was promoted colonel and sent away more or less empty-handed, the campaign in Europe being given priority. On returning to the St Lawrence River in May 1759, he was given duties which kept him from the decisive battle of the Heights of Abraham, during which both his hero Montcalm and General Wolfe fell. At the Treaty of Paris in 1763, Canada was ceded to the British, and France lost most of her other colonial possessions.</p><p>The young colonel pondered on the words of Admiral Lord <a href=\"/biographies/anson_george\">ANSON</a> on future British expansion into the Pacific, and the strategic importance of the Falkland Islands which commanded the gateway there. On his own initiative, largely at his own expense and with the backing of relatives, Bougainville obtained the permission of King Louis XV to establish a French settlement there. The frigate  <em>Aigle </em>and the corvette  <em>Sphinx </em>sailed from St Malo on 9 September 1763 under the command of the newly appointed naval captain, Bougainville. In the words of his English-speaking biographer, Michael Ross: 'The officer of the royal armies faded into the past; the sailor had been born'. The twenty-nine settlers were Acadians from Nova Scotia, largely of Breton descent. This was the first expedition ever to set out specifically for the Falkland Islands.</p><p>It is interesting that in his original short secret submission to the duc de Choiseul, minister for the Navy, of November 1762, Bougainville intended the Islands to be a springboard for the discovery of the great supposed southern continent ( <em>Terra Australis </em>), or failing that for the establishment of a French settlement north of California. The little colony at Fort Saint Louis (Port Louis) flourished for three years and more settlers joined the establishment, which was headed by Bougainville's cousin, Monsieur Bougainville de <a href=\"/biographies/nerville_michel\">NERVILLE</a>.</p><p>Bougainville returned to France in June 1764 and sailed for the Islands on 6 October with further settlers. On 5 January 1765 he saw his colonists again, and found them happy and healthy. In February Bougainville sailed to the Straits of Magellan to collect wood, closely watching the ships of Commodore <a href=\"/biographies/byron_john\">BYRON</a>. In April he left once more for France, arriving after a long voyage in August. To his disgust he discovered that, owing to the Family Compact between the Bourbon kings of France and Spain, the Islands were to be formally handed over to Spain. Bougainville visited Madrid in April 1766 to try to persuade the Spaniards to drop their claim and, once he had failed, to negotiate compensation - which was received to the tune of 618,000 livres (roughly £27,000).</p><p>As what may be called a consolation prize, Bougainville was permitted by Louis XV to undertake his circum-navigation of 1766 to 1769, in the frigate  <em>Boudeuse </em>and the smaller  <em>Etoile </em>. He began with a call at Port Louis to witness the handover of his colony on 1 April 1767. A few of his settlers volunteered to stay, but the majority departed in Spanish frigates for the long journey home, apart from ten who joined Bougainville's expedition. This was notable for the discovery of the Louisiade archipelago (off New Guinea) and other islands and for Bougainville's  <em>Voyage autour du Monde </em>, with its description of that supposed earthly paradise Tahiti. First published in 1771, a second, augmented edition appeared the following year. An English translation by JR Forster -  <em>Voyage around the World </em>- appeared in 1772. In the first volume of this work there is a folding chart (one of a number in the book) entitled  <em>Carte des Isles Malouines, nommées par les Anglois Isles Falkland  </em>(Map of the Malouine Islands, called by the English Falkland Islands). It depicts East Falkland, with  <em>Baye Françoise  </em>as the only placename, and also indicates the bay in West Falkland, where it was suspected that  <em>les Anglois sont establis  </em>(the English are established). The major part of Bougainville's narrative relates to his circumnavigation. However, he does summarise the history of the Islands (believing Amerigo Vespucci to have been their First DISCOVERER) and provides a most interesting account of the French settlement. A whole chapter is devoted to the natural history of the Malouines, based on observations made by de Nerville during his three years there. In describing the  <em>loup-renard  </em>(the warrah), which rare and often starving fox frequented the coastal dunes, making paths there which the French at first thought must be those of human inhabitants, Bougainville wonders how it can have reached the Islands. Despite the uninviting appearance of the land at first sight:</p><blockquote><blockquote>a horizon bounded by bare mountains; land intersected by the sea and whose dominion it seems to dispute; lifeless countryside, devoid of inhabitants; no trees to welcome those destined to be the first colonists; a vast silence sometimes broken by the cries of sea monsters; everywhere a sad uniformity...</blockquote></blockquote><p>on closer acquaintance, it was found that an equable and healthy climate, unsuspected food, peat and other resources made the settlement, with hard work and timber from the Straits, viable. Efforts to plant tree seedlings from the Straits appear to have been unsuccessful, although grain from Europe did grow. In concluding this chapter, Bougainville happily describes the Islands as being like Ireland, with a similar climate and similar advantages.</p><p>Having proceeded westwards across the Pacific Ocean and then via the Dutch East Indies and the Cape to France,  <em>Boudeuse </em>anchored at St Malo on 16 March 1769 followed by the arrival of  <em>Etoile </em>at Rochefort on 14 April, the former having lost only seven men during a round the world voyage of well over two years, and the  <em>Etoile </em>only two as a result of illness. According to the historian Etienne Taillemitte, Bougainville's narrative of his voyage and the voyage itself made little impression on his French contemporaries, praise and honour being largely reserved for Captain <a href=\"/biographies/cook_james\">COOK</a>. A minor sensation was caused by the arrival with Bougainville in Paris of the Tahitian Aotourou (Ahu-toru). He sadly died during his voyage home.</p><p>Bougainville had become interested in an attempt to reach the North Pole, which materialised in fact as the British (Phipps) naval expedition of 1773. He became a member of the Académie de Marine in 1770. He was given a command during the War of American Independence and was able to take refuge in the countryside with his wife and sons during the worst excesses of the French Revolution. Promoted vice-admiral in January 1792, he resigned one month later from a hopelessly undisciplined naval force at Brest. In 1799 he was appointed Senator and in 1808 became a Count of the Empire. He was to die on 31 August 1811 at his home in Paris, full of honours, at the time when Napoleon controlled all Europe. His ashes were interred at Paris in the Panthéon.</p><p>Since he had served his country on land and at sea, it is perhaps fitting to quote here from  <em>A History of Arctic Voyages, </em>which he wrote as  <em>Citizen </em>Bougainville, published in 1801. In the following paragraph he illustrates the difference between the soldier reaping glory in battle and the lonely navigator in uncharted seas:</p><blockquote><blockquote>A man who has ventured on the path of discovery and who has waged war on land and at sea may occasionally be allowed to compare the courage of the soldier with that of the sailor intent on discovery. In war, all is excitement and comradeship, the uniform, the force of example, the crowd of onlookers; and for each day of seductive danger there are a hundred of enjoyment which flatter one's self esteem. If eventually the soldier perishes, he is among his own, and the laurel will crown the urn where his ashes are laid. But the seafarer, that lonely being, has to fight dreadful and ever-recurring dangers in the vast emptiness between the often threatening sky and waves; it is in every moment of the days and months and years when he needs cold courage, unfailing steadfastness; and moreover he knows that if after a long sequence of strivings eventually crowned by success, he perishes perhaps at the end of his enterprise, no more will remain of him than the wake which his vessel has left on the waves.</blockquote></blockquote><p>In the twentieth century two notable studies, each of two volumes, were published in Paris. The first is the definitive biography by Jean-Etienne Martin-Allanic  <em>Bougainville navigateur et les découvertes de son temps </em>(1964)  and the second by Etienne Taillemitte,  <em>Bougainville et ses compagnons autour du monde 1766-1769  </em>(1977), which reproduces the surviving original manuscript journals of the seafarers. To end, here is the eighteenth century philosopher Diderot's lively sketch of Bougainville's character:</p><blockquote><blockquote>He loves women, entertainments, fine food, he lives in the whirlwind of high society, to which he lends himself with as good a grace as he did to the uncertainties of the element on which he had been buffeted for so long. He is good-natured and high spirited. He is a true Frenchman, weighed on one side by a treatise on integral and differential calculus and on the other by a voyage around the world. He was well endowed with the attainments necessary to benefit from his long journey. He is philosophic and steadfast, has courage, perception, frankness, a glance which sees through to the truth and cuts short the time for observations, caution, patience, the wish to see, to learn and to be useful; he is mathematical, mechanical, knowledgeable of natural history, geometry and astronomy.</blockquote></blockquote><p>Bougainville's name was given to a large island in the Solomons group and to the strait dividing it from Choiseul Island. He is perhaps best remembered by gardeners who cherish the beautiful climber  <em>Bougainvillea </em>. His son Hyacinthe commanded the circumnavigation of 1824-26 in the  <em>Thétis </em>but was disappointed in being unable to approach the deserted settlement of Port Louis because of poor visibility.</p><p>Bougainville has been credited with the first French circumnavigation, during the years 1766 - 1769, but it appears that this in fact had been accomplished by a number of merchant ships earlier in the eighteenth century. However, his was the first French official circumnavigation and it was the outcome of his own initiative in establishing and then having to abandon the settlement of Fort St Louis on the Falkland Islands. A man of considerable charm, he packed a great deal into his long life. Fortunate in surviving the Terror of the French Revolution, he was honoured by both the Kings of France and the Emperor Napoleon.</p>",

He was educated at Liverpool College and at Pembroke College, Oxford, and joined the Colonial Audit Service in 1939. After service in Nigeria until 1943, <em> </em>his next overseas appointment was to the Falkland Islands as Colonial Auditor from 1947 to 1951, during Sir <em> </em>Miles <a href=\"/biographies/clifford_sir\">CLIFFORD</a>'s term as Governor. It was typical of Boumphrey that he should interest himself in the history of the Islands and also in Antarctic exploration, following a visit to South Georgia and, early in 1950, a tour of British bases as a member of the Governor's party in RRS  <em>John Biscoe.  </em>His next posting, at the opposite extreme of climate, was as senior auditor in the Federation of Malaya, whence he moved to Singapore, there finishing his colonial service as deputy director of audit in 1958-59. He now turned to a new career, first as bursar of Godolphin School, Salisbury, then as finance officer of Durham University, and finally, in 1964, as the first bursar of the newly formed Lancaster University, where he served until his retirement in 1982.</p><p>Boumphrey was a kindly man whose ordered mind, scholarly pursuits and wide travel made him a stimulating companion under any circumstances. Outside his family and professional work, his abiding interests were in genealogy and heraldry, and he was an authority in both fields, being the author of several books. His tour of duty in the Falkland Islands led to the publication of papers on the Islands' placenames and on the early history of Port Louis; an annotated translation of <a href=\"/biographies/klutschak_heinrich\">HW KLUTSCHAK</a>'s paper on a visit to South Georgia in 1877-78; and an edited account of the discovery of Victoria Land in 1841.

        "body": "<p>civil servant and businessman, was born in Stanley on 7 October 1919 to Napoleon Bound (the obvious source of his nickname) and Mary Anne Bound, née Hutchinson. The family lived at Rincon Grande farm and later Saunders Island, but returned to Stanley in the late 1920s, seeking a better education for Nap and his older brother John (who also became a senior and respected civil servant). Nap Bound left school at 14 and became a government messenger. By 1937 he was a clerk in the Treasury and Customs department; a minute sent to the colonial treasurer described him as 'a young man of promise'. On the outbreak of War in 1939 he joined the Falkland Islands Defence Force, spending alternate two-week periods on 'outpost' and back at his desk in the Treasury. Promoted to sergeant and trained as a signaller, he operated Aldis lamps and the obsolete heliograph system. After military service he rejoined the Treasury full time.</p><p>In April 1951 Bound married his Treasury colleague Joan Biggs and they immediately left for Gibraltar where he was seconded to the governemnt, travelling aboard the RMS  <em>Fitzroy </em>and RMS  <em>Andes </em>. Back in the Falklands, they had two sons: Michael (Mensun) (b1952) and Graham (b1957). Bound's career was going well: for a period he had sole responsibility for the collection of income tax and later he was given the relatively senior acting post of assistant treasurer. In 1955 he was appointed acting assistant colonial secretary. In February 1957 he succeeded EW Enestrom as postmaster. It was something of a dream job for him, as he had been a serious philatelist since his childhood. In January 1960 he was appointed assistant colonial secretary, taking over from his brother John Bound, who had been appointed superintendent of post and telecommunications. The duties of ACS also included those of clerk of councils, preparing the agenda, papers and bills for both Legislative and Executive Councils. Later - and largely from interest rather than for the small salary - he also took on the role of film officer, managing the considerable library of feature films imported by the government for viewing in Stanley and on the Camp stations. He was appointed a Justice of the Peace of the Stanley Bench in 1963.</p><p>In 1966 Bound was directly involved in one of the most remarkable chapters of Falklands history. With the governor in the UK for consultations and the colonial secretary on leave, he and fellow Falkland Islander Les <a href=\"/biographies/gleadell_leslie\">GLEADELL</a> were, respectively, acting colonial secretary and acting governor. The two Islanders found themselves at the helm when Argentine nationalist guerrillas, calling themselves the <a href=\"/biographies/condor_group\">CONDOR</a> Group, hijacked an Aerolineas Argentinas Douglas DC4 airliner. They ordered the crew to fly them to Stanley, and with no airstrip the pilot made a skilful forced landing on Stanley's racecourse. As the emergency unfolded, Gleadell and Bound cabled Whitehall, describing the event as 'air piracy'. They received an unhelpful reply suggesting that they should use their own initiative. Fortunately, there seemed to be plenty of that, and a two-day siege of the aircraft co-ordinated by the few Royal Marines attached to the Defence Force ended in the Condor Group's surrender.</p><p>Bound was awarded an MBE in January 1970, when his health was deteriorating. Serious childhood asthma had returned, combined with a developing heart condition. On 29 December 1972, having suffered a heart attack, Bound wrote to the chief secretary, Tom <a href=\"/biographies/layng_thomas\">LAYNG</a>, requesting early retirement. ExCo agreed this and Governor <a href=\"/biographies/lewis_ernest\">LEWIS</a> wrote thanking him for 'sterling service during your long and distinguished career'. The governor especially valued his support as acting colonial secretary 'at a particularly difficult time in the affairs of the colony'. Retirement from government was not an end to public service. Bound was nominated to LegCo and spent several relatively uneventful years as a councillor. More satisfying was his renewed involvement in philately as a member of the Stamp Committee, which guided policy on the issuing of stamps. Stamp sales were still a major source of revenue. <em> </em></p><p>Bound had a heart bypass operation in 1976, and for a while enjoyed much better health. He worked closely with his wife on their retail business. The shop began life selling books and magazines, but rapidly developed into clothing, outdoor equipment and many other lines, challenging the virtual retail monopoly of the Falkland Islands Company. Bound also took a keen interest in the establishment of  <em>Penguin News </em>, founded by his second son, Graham. Writing anonymously, Nap Bound skilfully penned a satirical column which needled the colonial administrators. 'Little Chay's' adventures with authority and his apparently innocent questioning of 'Uncle Wrecks' (a scarcely veiled reference to Governor Rex <a href=\"/biographies/hunt_sir\">HUNT)</a> caused laughter and irritation in equal quantities. Along with his compatriots, he endured the Argentine invasion and occupation, writing letters about the occupation and the fighting which were subsequently published. At 64, however, Bound, was looking forward to real retirement and spending more time fishing and visiting Britain and Spain. But this plan was dashed in 1985 when, while in Britain, he suffered a heart attack and died.</p><p>Every community needs principled, hard-working public administrators and Nap Bound was an exemplary career civil servant, ultimately becoming deputy chief secretary, the highest post permitted to locally-born officials under the colonial government.</p>",

Slater meanwhile responded by sending the much larger sloop of war  <em>Germantown </em>, Captain William Francis <a href=\"/biographies/lynch_william\">LYNCH</a>, to Stanley.</p><p>Shortly after his arrival in the Islands Boys arrested the  <em>Washington  </em>and brought her and the  <em>Hudson </em>into Stanley on 2 March, so that their American masters could be put on trial. This was seen by Lynch, who had arrived in Stanley earlier that day and he immediately engaged in a policy of bluster towards both Governor Rennie and Boys. The following morning Lynch, accompanied by Smyley, called on the Governor, having previously beat to quarters and shotted his guns. A heated interview ensued. Lynch next wrote to Boys demanding to know what right he had to put his men on board American vessels. Boys replied that he was acting on the governor's instructions. Next morning the governor and Boys paid a formal call on the US Captain and were received with a 21 gun salute, after which Lynch moved his ship to dominate the  <em>Express </em>and the small shore battery. On 7 March, Hiram Clift, master of the  <em>Hudson </em>, appeared in court. The day before Lynch had moved his ship opposite the courthouse and during the trial trained his guns on the building. In spite of this the magistrates refused to be intimidated and Clift was duly fined, the  <em>Hudson </em>and  <em>Washington </em>leaving for America a week later. Lynch remained in Stanley for a month, concentrating his anger on Boys, again demanding what right he had to set foot uninvited on the two American vessels. Boys's reply is not known. On 12 April Henderson received a letter, dated 16 March, from Rennie reporting on the steps taken by Boys and on the same day the Admiral received a letter from Boys, dated 17 March, detailing his proceedings and enclosing copies of correspondence between himself, Rennie and Lynch, 'drawing attention to the tone of the latter'. Boys's tact and firmness in the face of Lynch's bluster must have prevented an unpleasant incident becoming more serious.</p><p>Boys's subsequent career was distinguished. He remained in command of the  <em>Express </em>until 1856, when he returned home and married. He was promoted Captain on 17 October 1857. After commanding the  <em>Pelorus </em>and  <em>Barrosa </em>on the China station he took command of the 9,210 ton  <em>Warrior </em>, the first sea-going ironclad, for her second commission in July 1867 (The  <em>Warrior </em>has been preserved and is now a tourist attraction in Portsmouth Harbour). He was later appointed in command of the gunnery training ship  <em>Excellent </em>, in which many future leaders of the navy served on his staff, including the legendary Jackie Fisher. In May 1874 he was appointed director of naval ordnance during a period of rapid technical development. He was promoted rear-admiral on 30 July 1875, vice-admiral on 1 April 1881 and full admiral on his retirement on 1 June 1885. He died at Blackheath on 16 March 1904. Boys was a fine seaman and one of the modernizers of the navy in its transition from sail to steam.</p>",

When she was two the family moved to Bordeaux in France, but they had returned to Kent by 1901. She began to earn a living as a typist of manuscripts and a compiler of catalogues for antiquarian booksellers.</p><p>In about 1918 she was asked by Rupert <a href=\"/biographies/vallentin_rupert\">VALLENTIN</a> to edit his notebooks of Falkland Islands natural history with a view to publication. She suggested that the work might be of more general appeal if he appended a history of the Islands to the book. Vallentin was too busy to undertake the necessary research and suggested Boyson should write the history as well as editing the notebooks. She agreed and wrote to Lord Milner, Secretary of State for the Colonies, seeking permission to consult Colonial Office files, with particular reference to the events of 1832 and 1833 when the colony was formally established. The Colonial Office were not prepared to allow complete disclosure - she was permitted to see the official reports but not to read the correspondence.</p><p>By late 1923 she had finished the work, which now comprised the history, sections on the industries, geophysical notes and an appendix of statistics all by Boyson and the Zoology by Vallentin. The Clarendon Press in Oxford agreed to publish the work but wanted the costs subsidised. Miss Boyson approached the then governor of the Islands, John <a href=\"/biographies/middleton_sir\">MIDDLETON</a>, who was keen to see the book published and arranged a grant of £100 from the Colonial Office. This presented difficulties on two fronts. First, the government indicated that they believed the grant gave them editorial control and were most anxious that nothing in the book could be used to promote the Argentine claim to the Islands. Second, Vallentin wished to refuse the government grant lest its acceptance led to a boycott of the book by the sheep farmers. Miss Boyson dismissed this idea, writing to the publisher Kenneth Sisam '...there are precisely 21 sheep farmers only 5 of whom ever open a book'.</p><p>Initially intended for publication in April 1924 to coincide with the opening of the British Empire Exhibition, copyright issues for the illustrations delayed the book until September. <em>The Times  </em>included it in the new books list on 10 and 24 October but did not review it. <em>The Royal Geographical Society Journal </em>did review it in March 1925 and described the book as '...important and most useful'. But sales were not encouraging; the first edition went out of print only in 1942.</p><p>Despite limited sales the importance of the book should not be underestimated. Boyson discovered many previously unpublished or unpublicised documents relating to the discovery and subsequent settlement of the Islands both in the Colonial Office and the British Museum. Almost all subsequent histories of the Islands have drawn extensively on her work, which remains the standard work on the history of the Islands.</p><p>Always a reclusive character, she retired in about 1937, and died in Arundel Hospital in West Sussex on 20 June 1946.</p>",

His father died when he was three and he was educated at Wellington and University College Oxford. He entered the Colonial Service in 1925 and was posted to Northern Rhodesia {Zambia}. He served as district officer in the bush and in the Secretariat at Lusaka. During the early years of World War II he was information officer in Lusaka when he was offered the post of colonial and financial secretary in the Falkland Islands. After sailing from Capetown via Buenos Aires and Montevideo, he was told on arrival by the captain of the <em>Fitzroy </em>: 'Don't imagine that you're going to achieve anything here. No colonial secretary ever has'. Bradley added: 'He was right', and clearly he found the trivia of administration in a small colony unsatisfying and perhaps Governor <a href=\"/biographies/cardinall_sir\">CARDINALL</a> uninspiring. 'We were two men and a boy keeping the parish pump going,' he wrote in his memoirs. However he did find the chores of colonial secretary in the Islands useful preparation for similar duties on a larger stage in Africa. Organising the logistic backup to Operation Tabarin* was a challenge he enjoyed and he managed one trip with the <em>Fitzroy </em>to the Antarctic which left a deep impression.</p><p>In November 1945 he left Stanley for the Gold Coast {Ghana} to become under-secretary as that colony entered a troubled period of strikes in the run-up to independence. In 1948 he returned to London to edit a new journal for the Colonial Service called <em>Corona </em>. In 1953 he became director of the Commonwealth Institute and supervised the building of the new institute in Holland Park which was opened in 1962. He retired in 1969, but remained a trustee until l971. He was awarded the CMG in 1946 and created a Knight Bachelor in 1963.</p><p>Bradley wrote a number of books on Africa and the Commonwealth of which <em>Diary of a District Officer </em>was the most successful.

        "body": "<p>was born in Carlow, Ireland, on 25 January 1846, the fourth of seven sons of the Rev William and Jane Brandon. They also had five daughters. Six of the seven brothers became ordained Anglican clergymen of the Church of Ireland, all of them having graduated from Trinity College, Dublin. Brandon achieved a second class <em>testimonium </em>* in the divinity school in 1867. The girls all either worked in missions or married clergymen.</p><p>Brandon was ordained in 1869, just at the time of the disestablishment of the (Anglican) Church of Ireland. He served as a curate in Clonmore, Co Wicklow, from 1869-1872 and then as rector of Kilnehue, Co Wexford, for five years. In 1877 he was appointed to the post of colonial chaplain in the Falkland Islands. With the job of chaplain went the duties of schools inspector, and he also served on ExCo from late 1883 to 1889. After four years he returned to Ireland on leave, and married his cousin Josephine Jameson in Donnybrook, Dublin in 1881. They had no children.</p><p>The Brandons lived all their time in the Falklands in the 'old Deanery' of which the Dean wrote in 1902: 'The house is composed of two small houses which were the first two houses erected in Stanley; they were connected by the Reverend Mr. Bull' and further 'It has been the residence of the Colonial Chaplains since the appointment of the Reverend Mr. Moody in 1845'. When the building was pulled down in 1935 it was described in the <em>Penguin </em>as 'an unhealthy ramshackle patchwork of rooms'.</p><p>Brandon was a man of enormous energy and drive. He rode all over East and West Falkland, visiting the most remote shepherds' houses as well as the main settlements, baptizing children and holding services. The WM Dean papers record that Brandon:</p><blockquote><blockquote>...tried each year to visit every family in the Islands. A stupendous task. He always travelled with a large magic lantern to amuse the children. Station managers at times were not too pleased at having to house this outfit, especially as the Dean, though shortsighted, had his own ideas about the track, so he would often veer away from his guide, eventually having to be rescued with his horse bogged up to the belly.</blockquote></blockquote><p>In his capacity as schools inspector in 1889 Brandon reported:</p><blockquote><blockquote>When visiting the West Falkland Island and several of the smaller adjacent islands in October and November 1888, I examined fifty children, all of whom were receiving instruction from their parents. In many cases little can be done owing to the defective education of the parents themselves.</blockquote></blockquote><p>In February 1890 Brandon reported that during his annual visit to the Western Islands 'there were 17 baptisms and one marriage - at Keppel 62 children were catechised and examined'</p><p>Brandon embarked on a number of crusades, one of which was to form abstinence societies to combat the evils of drink, one for women and the other for men and youths. In 1879, when he had not been long in the Islands he was active in a petition for the release of Thomas Alday, who had been imprisoned for embezzlement. In 1890 something of a dispute with Governor <a href=\"/biographies/kerr_thomas\">KERR</a> arose when Brandon petitioned the Secretary of State, Lord Knutsford, with reference to the 'Educational appliances etc. in the Government School in Stanley Falkland Islands'. It was a severe criticism of the public buildings used as schools, and as a residence for the schoolmaster and his family. Governor Kerr wrote a long report to accompany the petition, and also commented that both Roman Catholic and Protestant children left the Government school when the Roman Catholic priest, Father <a href=\"/biographies/diamond_patrick\">DIAMOND</a>, opened his school.</p><p>Josephine Brandon was very much like her husband, working tirelessly for the church. She devoted herself to the Sunday schools, one held in the morning and the other in the afternoon, the Band of Hope (for children), and the music and choir of the church. She established a Sunday school library, and later the Falkland Island Children's Lending Library which opened in 1890. She also established the Stanley Lending Library, which operated from the service room of Holy Trinity Church in the first instance, and later from the vestry of the Cathedral. On occasion she also travelled with her husband. In 1909 a subscriber writing in the <em>Falkland Islands Magazine </em>said: 'All acquainted with its history will acknowledge that the Library was one of the chief interests of Mrs. Brandon. A diligent and omnivorous reader herself, she spent much time and thought on the Library' and goes on to say that in recognition of her thirty years of unselfish toil and self-denial which she gave for the good of young and old in the Colony it would be a fitting tribute to name the Library after her.</p><p>In May 1889 Brandon launched the monthly <em>Falkland Islands Magazine </em>which he typeset and printed himself. Today these magazines are a wonderful source of information for researchers, and in their own time must have been a much-appreciated source of local news to the isolated settlements. Each begins with a full-page homily, gives information on services for the coming month, including the epistle and gospel readings, and psalms for each Sunday. Births, marriages and deaths are recorded, and news of shipping giving dates of incoming and outgoing mails and passengers carried. Ordinances passed, information about the Falkland Island Social Club and Mutual Improvement Association, proceedings of the Destitute Poor Fund, the Children's Penny Savings Bank, news of Stanley Social Club, the Stanley Benefit Club and the formation of a limited Joint Stock Company to build the Public Assembly Rooms are all to be found in the first year of publication. Also circulated with the magazine were leaflets imported from England, <em>Home Words </em>to begin with, and by 1894 the <em>Church Monthly.  </em>The magazine originally cost one shilling and sixpence per annum, but owing to the cost of printing was raised the following year to two shillings and sixpence per annum. However the advertisements were very much more expensive; five shillings for five lines and one shilling for every additional line of ten words or under.</p><p>Perhaps Brandon's greatest challenge came with the building of Christ Church Cathedral. In 1886 the building housing Holy Trinity (which was never consecrated) and the schoolroom was badly damaged in a peat slip, and thereafter services were held in a sail-loft fitted up for the purpose. It was decided to build a Cathedral on the site of Holy Trinity, and in 1888 Bishop <a href=\"/biographies/stirling_waite\">STIRLING</a> issued an appeal in the English papers for this. He records in his booklet, published in Buenos Aires in 1891 in connection with fund raising for the new church, that the colonial contributions exceed £3,000, and 'as an encouragement Her Majesty the Queen graciously sent £30'. The Bishop, and more particularly his daughter and his son-in-law Mr FW Robinson, also raised £3000, making a total of £6000, the estimated sum needed, but inevitably costs were far greater than anticipated. Indeed Mr Robinson, a busy bank manager who never set foot in the Islands, seems to have been pivotal to the whole enterprise, keeping the rather complicated accounts between South America, England and the Falkland Islands. He also oversaw the purchase in England and the freighting out of materials. Locally, fundraising bazaars and sales of work continued apace.</p><p>Bishop Stirling visited Stanley in August 1889 with the plans. The church was to be built with the stone of the old church and school, the corners being brick, and cut stone from England imported for the windows and doors. A ship was chartered to bring materials from England, and a foreman mason arrived in December. By January 1890 the excavations for the new church were almost complete, and sand was being procured from the beach for the foundations. A clerk of works and two bricklayers had arrived by February. They were to be assisted by local labour, the work force amounting to twenty men. Building was commenced, but not without delays and a tragic death. The ship <em>Dux </em>was badly delayed, which meant a shortage of materials, the labour force stopped work demanding a higher rate of pay, and Joseph Alazia died while quarrying stone.</p><p>By early 1892 the building was ready for consecration by Bishop Stirling, which took place on Sunday 21 February. Brandon was made Dean of the new Cathedral. A good deal still remained to be done however. The Building Fund debt stood at over £500 and this amount was loaned by Mr WW <a href=\"/biographies/bertrand_william\">BERTRAND</a> on the strength of an I.O.U. The <em>Falkland Island Magazine </em>records that the 'Tower remains unfinished. The Dado is not yet provided. The Vestry requires attention. An organ is wanted'. This last seemed an urgent requirement, for the harmonium which had done duty for nearly thirty years was worn out. In December of that year not only did the organ arrive, but also an assistant for the Dean, the Rev EC Aspinall, who three months later went on an extended tour of West Falkland and the adjacent islands, while the Dean made a tour of the south of East Falkland. Bishop Stirling visited again in early 1893, and his address pointed out in no uncertain terms that there remained much to be done, both inside and outside the Cathedral.</p><p>In early 1900 Mrs Aspinall's health broke down, and the family left the Islands in August, to be replaced in October by the Rev C Blount and family from Co Carlow, Ireland. A year later money was being raised to build Church House to accommodate the Blounts, his quarters now being required by the colonial secretary. The land had been presented to Christ Church by Mr Alex Pitaluga some years previously. The house was completed and the Blount family moved in on 1 July, 1902.</p><p>Work continued on the Cathedral for some years, as money became available from the endless fundraising efforts and generous contributions. The tower was completed in 1903, the decision having been taken that it should be ninety feet high rather than the planned one hundred and ten. The bells and clock were given by one of the main benefactors of the church, Mrs GM (Orissa) <a href=\"/biographies/dean_orissa\">DEAN</a>, and were hung in April 1905. The clock was set going on Easter Day, but not the chimes.</p><p>During all this time the normal life of the church in Stanley and the camp continued, with the Dean and his assistant making weeks long journeys round the East and West Falkland. The hundreds of miles covered by horse and by boat give an indication of their zeal and determination to help their far-flung parishioners. The new Bishop <a href=\"/biographies/every_edward\">EVERY</a> visited in 1903, and returned again the following year.</p><p>The Dean and Mrs Brandon went on holiday to England in 1904. They had been given a cheque for £63·15s 'with strict instructions that it was not to be expended on anything except their relaxation and enjoyment during a well earned holiday'. Notwithstanding this, it seems to have been a very busy time. Separately and together they visited many Islanders now living in England, the Dean went to the foundry to see the bells destined for Christ Church Cathedral, and 'spent many hours at Messrs. Benson learning the mechanism of the Clock'. When he returned he brought the materials for a porch at Church House.</p><p>The following year saw the new school building begun, at the rear of the Cathedral. This was opened in October 1906, and boasted a playground with a swing and a merry-go-round.</p><p>In August 1906 the Reverend C Rome Hall arrived to replace Blount who was going to Buenos Aires, and then in February the following year came the announcement that the Reverend Cyril Henry Golding Bird had been appointed to succeed Dean Brandon.</p><p>Dean and Mrs Brandon left in May 1907, going back to live in Ireland. The Dean died in July 1933 at Rathbran Glebe, Stratford on Slaney, Co Wicklow where he had been incumbent of this small Irish parish. He is commemorated by Brandon Road in Stanley.</p>",

At the beginning of his life there his status was ill-defined: too young to be a missionary and too old to be treated as a child. He was set to working physically, mixing freely with the Indians. The result was a growing bond and understanding between Bridges and the Fuegian Indians that lasted his whole life. One of its fruits was his Yahgan Dictionary, published posthumously. Another was Bridges' deep care for these tribal people that led to his ordination and his subsequent work among them at Ushuaia, and ultimately to his settling at Estancia Harberton on the Beagle Channel. On Despard's leaving Keppel in 1861, Bridges and <a href=\"/biographies/bartlett_william\">BARTLETT</a> were left in charge of the depleted Keppel Mission, pending the arrival of the new superintendent and the renewal of its objectives. In the intervening 16 months, Bridges spent many hours with <a href=\"/biographies/okokko\">OKOKKO</a> and Camilenna, learning the intricacies of their speech.

        "body": "<p>mariner and sealer, was born in Perth, Tayside. Nothing is known of his early life or schooling, but his brother was master of a brig trading between Liverpool and Quebec. It can be assumed that Brisbane's seafaring started in the merchant service as there is no trace of any service in naval records. As he was of an age during the Napoleonic Wars to be press-ganged into the Royal Navy this shows either a remarkable astuteness or an ability for anonymity.</p><p><strong>Sealing with Weddell</strong></p><p>He first swam into the general public's gaze in 1825 within the covers of a book:  <em>A Voyage Towards The South Pole Performed In The Years 1822-24 </em>by James <a href=\"/biographies/weddell_james\">WEDDELL</a>. This was the narrative of a sealing voyage into the Antarctic with two vessels, the 160 ton brig  <em>Jane </em>commanded by Weddell, and owned by him with two other partners. Her consort was the small 65 ton cutter  <em>Beaufoy </em>commanded by Brisbane with a crew of thirteen; this small vessel also being part owned by Weddell. Weddell was no stranger to Antarctic sealing, having sailed  <em>Jane </em>to the Falkland Islands and South Shetland Islands in 1819-20 and  <em>Jane </em>and  <em>Beaufoy </em>(commanded by Michael McLeod) to the Falkland Islands, South Georgia, South Shetland Islands and South Orkney Islands in 1821-22.</p><p>The  <em>Jane </em>and  <em>Beaufoy </em>sailed from England on 17 September 1822:  <em>Jane </em>and Weddell bound for Madeira to stock with the island's wine,  <em>Beaufoy </em>and Brisbane for Bonavista in the Cape Verde Islands to load salt for the curing of sealskins. Weddell rejoined Brisbane at Bonavista and both vessels sailed in company on 20 October, bound for South America. By 19 December they were anchored in the bay of Port St Elena on the South American coast to repair a troublesome leak in the brig. Brisbane sailed south in search of seals, arranging to meet Weddell at Penguin Island off the Patagonian coast. On New Year's Day 1823 the two vessels were reunited and sailed for the South Orkneys. These islands, discovered on 6 December 1821, were relatively unknown, and Weddell was determined to explore them for both seals and hydrography. On 12 January 1823 they sighted the peaks of the islands. Two days later they were sealing, but with little success. The southerly coast of the South Orkneys was roughly surveyed by Brisbane; and in tribute Weddell gave the name Brisbane's Bluff (now Cape Faraday) to the cliffs on the north point of Powell Island. Few seals were found and Weddell decided to sail south in the hope of finding undiscovered sealing islands. It was, however, but slow progress, with frequent fogs, snow squalls, and the necessity to heave to at night to avoid damaging collisions with ice floes. By 27 January they had reached 64°58'S. Here Weddell decided to sail north and look for land between the South Orkneys and the South Sandwich Islands. No land was found and on 4 February the  <em>Jane </em>and  <em>Beaufoy </em>turned south again. During one day of their southern quest they sailed through a massed phalanx of 66 icebergs. On 20 February 1823 they reached 74°15'S and 34°16'W: making a furthest south record which was to last until James Clark <a href=\"/biographies/ross_sir\">ROSS</a> reached 78°10'S in the Ross Sea on 23 February 1842.</p><p>As the season was now growing short and with the wind freshening from the south, Weddell made the decision to head north and the two vessels bore away for South Georgia, but not before colours were raised, cannons fired and an extra tot of rum issued to all hands. On 5 March they anchored in South Georgia's Undine Bay. After five months at sea, fearing the onset of scurvy, they quickly set about collecting fresh greens and young albatross for the pot. A month was spent at South Georgia before sailing for the Falkland Islands. The passage proved stormy, but on 11 May the two vessels came to anchor at New Island. As the rest of the winter was to be spent in the Falklands the anchorage was shifted to Weddell Island where the  <em>Jane's </em>topmasts were struck down and all was made secure for winter gales. The  <em>Beaufoy  </em>was kept in commission in the constant search for fur seals. On 7 October, both vessels were again prepared to sail for the South Shetlands. On 16 October, some 95 miles from the South Shetlands, they came across thick packice. Weddell and Brisbane now ranged along the edge of the pack for a over a month, seeking a lead to the islands. On 16 November, with both vessels damaged by ice, the men frostbitten and with clothes worn to shreds, the decision was taken to sail for Tierra del Fuego. They came to anchor on 23 November in Wigwam Cove {Caleta San Martin} on Hermite Island, some ten miles north-west of Cape Horn. On 9 December Brisbane sailed for one more attempt at the South Shetlands; but found the packice impenetrable. Returning to Tierra del Fuego the  <em>Beaufoy </em>'s sails were split in a vicious squall and, seeking a harbour to make repairs, Brisbane came upon a sheltered anchorage some miles up a narrow sound. The next day, repairs completed and sailing away from his new-found harbour, Brisbane sighted the <em>Jane  </em>sealing off the Ildefonsos Islands. Brisbane told Weddell of the anchorage; they then made their way up New Year's Sound {Seno Año Nuevo} and into Indian Cove, coming to anchor on 26 December. The next day Brisbane sailed for the Diego Ramirez Islands, some 55 miles south-west of Cape Horn. On the last day of 1823 he returned to Indian Cove with a small quantity of sealskins, plus meat and blubber for the Fuegians camped at the cove.</p><p>On 4 January 1824 Weddell and Brisbane separated: Weddell to sail for the eastern Patagonian coast; Brisbane to remain sealing in the immediate neighbourhood until 20 January and then sail for the Falkland Islands and South Georgia. The two vessels were to rejoin off the coast of Patagonia in March. Southerly gales blew the  <em>Beaufoy </em>far north of the rendezvous position, and Brisbane made the decision to sail for England, arriving on 20 June 1824. Weddell arrived two weeks later and plans were made for Brisbane to sail south again for another sealing voyage, this time alone.</p><p><strong>Sealing as Master</strong></p><p>On 23 August 1824 Brisbane and the  <em>Beaufoy </em>sailed from the Downs. They sealed along the Patagonian coast and the Falkland Islands before sailing into Maxwell's Harbour, twelve miles north-east of Cape Horn, on 16 October 1825. The Fuegians recognized both Brisbane and several of the crew: Brisbane had made a great impression upon them during the previous visit with his skill at using their favourite weapon, the slingshot. Brisbane sailed from Tierra del Fuego on 17 December, bound for Patagonia's east coast. Here Brisbane shot an animal 'of the lion species' though not before it had killed the cutter's pet bulldog. (Brisbane brought back the skin and skull for identification; it was identified as a puma.) On 15 January 1826 the  <em>Beaufoy </em>sailed for home, arriving at the Downs on 29 March.</p><p>A few months later, on 16 June 1826, Brisbane became master of the 103 ton schooner  <em>Prince of Saxe Coburg </em>, the owners being Pirie &amp; Co of Freeman's Court, Cornhill, and outfitted for a sealing voyage to the South Shetlands. The voyage proved disastrous. Meeting atrocious weather off the South Shetlands, and then being beset and damaged by packice, Brisbane was forced to run for Tierra del Fuego to make repairs. But, on 16 December 1826, lying at anchor in Fury Bay, at the southern end of the Cockburn Channel, the schooner was driven ashore by violent 'williwaws' and wrecked. Brisbane and his crew of twenty-one survived and managed to rescue three of the schooner's boats and most of the provisions. Having established a camp ashore with improvised tents, Brisbane was faced with the problem of organizing an escape from their desolate and remote island. Over the next few weeks one man died, one man accidentally exploded a cask of gunpowder and was badly hurt, and three mutinous crew were isolated on three separate islands with a week's provisions. Seven other crew, with Brisbane's permission, took the largest of the boats and set off to make their way through the maze of the Fuegian channels in an attempt to reach the Río Negro on the Atlantic coast of South America, over a thousand miles away. Here it was believed lay the nearest point of civilized habitation. (They did survive their voyage, and then volunteered for service with a Buenos Aires squadron engaged in a war with Brazil.)</p><p>Brisbane organized the remaining party. Some were sent out in the two boats to scour the channels in the hope of finding other sealing vessels. The rest set to work to construct a vessel from the wreckage of the schooner. Two weeks later the boats returned unsuccessful. But more attempts were made, and, on 3 March 1827, one of the boats was sighted by HMS  <em>Beagle </em>, commanded by Captain Pringle Stokes, engaged in the survey of the South American coast. Stokes then set off with two ten-oared launches to cover the eighty miles through the Barbara Channel to Fury Bay and rescue the castaways.</p><p>Brisbane returned to London towards the end of 1827, where he found another command, also owned by Pirie &amp; Co., the 145 ton schooner  <em>Hope </em>outfitted for sealing. By 17 January 1828 Brisbane was heading south across the Bay of Biscay. During the April of 1829 Brisbane was wrecked again, but this time in South Georgia. He and the crew made a shallop from the wreckage and sailed for Montevideo. The building of the shallop and the passage across to Montevideo must have been accomplished with some speed, as the  <em>Hope's  </em>certificate of registration was delivered to the British Consul on 20 May.</p><p>Brisbane's third shipwreck, aboard the sealer  <em>Bellville </em>commanded by Captain Bray, happened during February 1830 on the east coast of Tierra del Fuego, fourteen miles to the west of Cape San Diego at the northern entrance to the Le Maire Strait. The castaways had great trouble from the Fuegians stealing their tools during the construction of a decked shallop from the remains of the wreck. By 9 April the provisions saved from the wreck were finished. Close to starvation they existed on hides, putrid blubber, berries, limpets and fish. On 1 May they set to sea in what proved a very leaky boat, their only provisions being hides. Four days later they sighted Cape Meredith on the southern extremity of West Falkland. The following day two men died. This was followed by a gale and the near foundering of the shallop. But they managed to make a landing in a sheltered cove, promptly killed geese, and were just as promptly ill from the sudden change of diet. On 17 May they landed at Port Pleasant and killed two wild cows - promptly eaten, but this time with no illness. By 30 May they were safely at Port Louis.</p><p><strong>With Vernet</strong></p><p>That same year a British naval officer met Brisbane at Louis <a href=\"/biographies/vernet_louis\">VERNET</a>'s house in Port Louis, for Brisbane had a sealing contract with Vernet. Buenos Aires had granted fishing rights to Vernet and, in order to protect these, Vernet made Brisbane his director of fisheries. Brisbane visited Buenos Aires in 1830 and gave information to the  <em>British Packet and Argentine News </em>on Vernet's fishing claims and warnings to sealers. Woodbine <a href=\"/biographies/parish_sir\">PARISH</a>, the British minister, met Brisbane and warned him not to interfere with any British vessels. In July and August of 1831, three American schooners,  <em>Breakwater, Harriet,  </em>and <em>Superior,  </em>were seized by Vernet and Brisbane. The  <em>Breakwater </em>escaped and the  <em>Superior  </em>was allowed to continue sealing, but under certain conditions. Vernet and his family then sailed aboard the  <em>Harriet </em>for Buenos Aires in order to legalise her seizure, reaching Buenos Aires on 19 November 1831. While Vernet told the Argentine authorities that he had left Henry Metcalfe in charge at Port Louis, Brisbane was particularly exposed as the person who had actually seized the American schooners.</p><p>The seizure of the American schooners proved disastrous for Vernet, Brisbane, and the settlers at Port Louis. Silas M <a href=\"/biographies/duncan_silas\">DUNCAN</a>, commanding the powerful USS  <em>Lexington </em>, then at the River Plate, heard of Vernet's action. Branding Vernet a pirate and his actions an outrage on American citizens, Duncan sailed for Port Louis to exact revenge. On 31 December 1831 the  <em>Lexington </em>came to anchor off Port Louis. Brisbane was brought on board, the settlement's guns spiked, magazine fired, weapons seized. On 3 February 1832 the  <em>Lexington </em>arrived at Montevideo carrying Brisbane and six settlers, all under arrest. On 16 February Vernet wrote to Brisbane reporting that Duncan's attack on Port Louis had ruined him, that Brisbane had been wronged, but hoping that when Brisbane got to America 'justice will be done you'. On 16 April the seven prisoners were transferred to the USS  <em>Warren </em>. Brisbane was later released on the orders of Commodore Rogers.</p><p>Brisbane returned to the Falklands as pilot of the  <em>Sarandi </em>, commanded by Jose Pinedo, bringing the unfortunate Major Juan <a href=\"/biographies/mestivier_joseph\">MESTIVIER</a> appointed as governor by Buenos Aires to replace Vernet. The  <em>Lexington </em>incident and the rumour that Washington contemplated taking possession of the Falklands to safeguard American sealing and whaling interests prompted the British to repossess the islands. On 3 January 1833 the Union Jack was raised at Port Louis on the orders of John <a href=\"/biographies/onslow_john\">ONSLOW</a>, commander of HM sloop  <em>Clio </em>. The flag was entrusted for its raising and lowering to William <a href=\"/biographies/dickson_william\">DICKSON</a>, Vernet's storekeeper. The <em>Sarandi,  </em>carrying the lowered Argentine flag, sailed for Buenos Aires on 5 January and Brisbane resigned as pilot.</p><p>On 1 March 1833, HMS  <em>Beagle </em>, commanded by Captain Robert <a href=\"/biographies/fitzroy_robert\">FITZROY</a> and with Charles <a href=\"/biographies/darwin_charles\">DARWIN</a> on board as naturalist, anchored in Berkeley Sound. A boat was sent to Port Louis and returned with the news that Brisbane had just arrived from Buenos Aires aboard the schooner  <em>Rapid </em>. Brisbane had been delighted to meet the <em>Beagle </em>'s officer as he had been one of those who helped save his life when wrecked in the  <em>Prince of Saxe Coburg </em>. The next day Brisbane came aboard  <em>Beagle </em>and presented his papers. These showed that he was only acting as Vernet's private agent to look after the remains of his private property, and there was not the slightest reference to civil or military authority. FitzRoy then visited Port Louis and, expecting a thriving community, found nothing but desolation. Brisbane told him that it was all due to the  <em>Lexington </em>, and that he had been treated as a pirate and abused 'most violently' by Duncan on the quarterdeck. Brisbane and FitzRoy had many conversations on a variety of subjects concerning the Falklands: the growing of wheat and vegetables at Port Louis, the wool sent to Liverpool from East Falkland selling for nearly double the price of Buenos Aires wool, the collecting of pearls from the large mussels (Brisbane had a bottle full), the whalebones found a hundred feet above high water. And FitzRoy, in his account of the Falklands, pays due regard to these conversations, writing that he was indebted to Brisbane for most of the information. But FitzRoy sailed from the Falklands with 'gloomy forebodings' on the lack of regular authority in a virtually lawless group of islands.</p><p><strong>Death at Port Louis</strong></p><p>FitzRoy was proved right. On 26 August 1833, resenting Brisbane's fearless attempts to protect Vernet's property, five Indian convicts and three gauchos led by Antonio <a href=\"/biographies/rivero_antonio\">RIVERO</a> went on a killing spree in Port Louis, murdering Brisbane, William Dickson, Antony Wagner, Juan <a href=\"/biographies/simon_jean\">SIMON</a> and Venturo Pasos. John <a href=\"/biographies/helsby_thomas\">HELSBY</a>, who had arrived with Brisbane aboard the  <em>Rapid </em>, narrowly escaped being murdered and described seeing Brisbane lying dead upon the floor: 'he appeared to have been making towards his pistols before he fell, and there was a smile of contempt or disdain very strongly marked in his countenance'. The killers later dragged his body behind a horse and left it some distance from the house.</p><p>A year later, on the  <em>Beagle's </em>second visit to the Falklands, FitzRoy visited Port Louis to find Brisbane's feet protruding above the ground from a shallow grave. Dogs had fed upon the corpse. FitzRoy's anger is palpable:</p><blockquote><blockquote>This was the fate of an honest, industrious and most faithful man: of a man who feared no danger, and despised hardships. He was murdered by villains, because he defended the property of his friend; he was mangled by them to satisfy their hellish spite; dragged by lasso, at a horse's heels, away from the houses, and left to be eaten by dogs.</blockquote></blockquote><p>In 1842 his body was reburied by Captain James Clark <a href=\"/biographies/ross_sir\">ROSS</a>, then in the Falklands with the  <em>Erebus </em>and  <em>Terror </em>. A wooden memorial was erected over his grave, inscribed:</p><blockquote><blockquote>To the</blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>MEMORY</blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>of</blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>Mr. Matthew Brisbane</blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>who was barbarousley</blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>murdered on the</blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>26th August 1833</blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>___________</blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>In the command of the</blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>Beaufoy Cutter he was</blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>the Zealous and able</blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>Companion of Captn</blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>James Weddell during</blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>his enterprising Voyage</blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>to beyond the 74th Degree of</blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>South Latitude</blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>in February 1823</blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>___________</blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>His remains were removed to</blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>this spot by the crews of H.B.M.</blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>ships \"Erebus\" and \"Terror\"</blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>on the 25th August, 1842.</blockquote></blockquote><p>On 3 April 1906 the wooden headstone, being much weathered and barely legible, was replaced with a new memorial bearing the same inscription. This in turn was replaced in 1933 by a marble slab. The wooden headstone is now in the museum at Stanley, where there is a Brisbane Road. Brisbane's other memorials are on charts: Cape Brisbane and Mount Beaufoy on Henderson Island in Tierra del Fuego, and Brisbane Heights on Coronation Island in the South Orkneys.</p><p>Weddell, Ross, and FitzRoy, all superb seamen, had the highest regard for Brisbane. For here was a man with a tough pioneering quality about him and one who was obviously fascinated by the Falklands. But then he would probably have found himself at home on any nineteenth-century frontier. For the Falklands he should be remembered as a man striving to bring some order to a virtually lawless community.</p>",

Brooke attempted to assert his authority over the soldiers of the garrison and tried to use them as jurors. He also imprisoned an American sea-captain, Sweeney, for non-payment of his steward - an action which the captain alleged was inspired by Lane. In July 1860, while Brooke was on leave and angling for another job, a Colonial Office official minuted: 'he is a perverse functionary, bad in his judgement and vexatious in his conduct: but he has never gone beyond the law' [ie and cannot be dismissed].</p><p>Reason for dismissal was soon provided: Governor Moore informed London that when clearing his wife Emma's papers after her death, he had come across a letter from Brooke in terms which would have justified him throwing Brooke out of the house. When the Colonial Office taxed Brooke with 'domestic treachery', he replied with a long letter accusing Moore of brutish and suspicious behaviour, but without specifically denying the implied relationship with Emma Moore. 'The letter can not be read without a most unfortunate impression of Captain Moore's character', noted the Colonial Office, 'but that can not alter the decision as to Mr Brooke'. Indeed Brooke disappears from view at this point.</p>",

His father explained to the Admiralty that he had 'run' on account of his debts and on 15 December 1871 he was 'discharged the Service to avoid a court martial'. He was appointed assistant district clerk at Grand Port, Mauritius in 1874 and selected by the governor to enquire into the treatment of labourers employed in the lesser dependencies of that colony.

        "body": " <p>foreign secretary and baron, was born on 2 September 1914, son of George Brown, grocer's packer, and Rosina, née Mason. He was educated at local schools and ended his schooling at age 15. He took a strong interest in trade union work and was elected Labour MP in 1945. Brown held junior ministerial posts in the Attlee government. When Labour returned to power in 1964, Brown became secretary of state for economic affairs. On 11 August 1966 he was made secretary of state for foreign affairs</p><p>Brown does not mention the Falkland Islands in his political memoirs <em>In My Way </em>(1971). The internal affairs of the Islands were still dealt with by the Commonwealth Relations Office and Brown's direct involvement in Falklands matters does not appear to have been very great. Nevertheless his period as foreign secretary was important in Falklands-British-Argentine relations. It was during this time that the draft Memorandum of Understanding between Britain and Argentina took shape. This was eventually to be abandoned by the British Government in December 1968 but not before it had led to profound mistrust on the part of Islanders of British intentions. All this came to a head in March 1968 when, coincidentally and for reasons unconnected with the Falklands, Brown resigned as foreign secretary.</p><p>When Brown took office, talks between Britain and Argentina were proceeding at official level from time to time. Michael <a href=\"/biographies/stewart_robert\">STEWART</a>, who had been Brown's predecessor and was to be his successor, had agreed to their resumption when visiting Buenos Aires in January 1966. Britain's main intention was to improve communications between the Falklands and Argentina which were made difficult, if not impossible, by Argentine restrictions. Talks in London in July 1966 between officials ended with agreement to their continuing in October after both sides had consulted their governments. In the words of the Franks Report: 'the British delegation rejected the implication that Britain's occupation of the Islands was illegal but there was agreement that there should be detailed examination... of ways of decreasing friction and of limiting the scale of the dispute'.</p><p>However, in late September 1966 when the Duke of Edinburgh was visiting Argentina for the 150th Anniversary of the Argentine Republic, leaflets were thrown at him by students, shots were fired at the house in which he was staying and there was a news agency report of a plot to kidnap him and ransom him for the Falkland Islands. On 28 September the <a href=\"/biographies/condor_group\">CONDOR</a> Group hijacked an Argentine airliner which landed in the Islands. These incidents embarrassed the Argentine government but they also drew public attention in Britain to the ongoing dispute.</p><p>Further talks were held in November 1966. At these talks a British proposal for a sovereignty freeze for a minimum of thirty years, at the end of which the Islanders could choose between British and Argentine rule, was rejected. In March 1967 the British Government for the first time accepted in talks between officials that they would be willing to concede sovereignty under certain conditions, provided that Islanders' wishes were respected. This was the genesis of the eventual Memorandum of Understanding. But the inherent contradiction between British and Argentine positions was apparent from the start. On 23 June 1966 Brown saw the Argentine foreign minister, Costa Mendez, in New York. Costa Mendez stressed that making a transfer of sovereignty dependent on the wishes of the inhabitants would not be acceptable to Argentina. Brown argued strongly that he could not defend any transfer of sovereignty before parliamentary and public opinion if it disregarded the wishes of the Islanders.</p><p>This remained Brown's position throughout his term of office and it was the position maintained by officials in many discussions held with Argentina in 1967 and 1968. HMG told the Islanders as much as they felt they could without compromising the negotiations over the wording of the Memorandum. An account of the general thrust of their thinking, covering the various conditions regarding human, cultural and property rights which would have to accompany any change of sovereignty, was given to ExCo by WH <a href=\"/biographies/thompson_willoughby\">THOMPSON</a>, the colonial secretary acting for Governor <a href=\"/biographies/haskard_cosmo\">HASKARD</a> in July 1967, and in February 1968 they were eventually shown a draft of the Memorandum by Haskard. The general run of Islanders knew little or nothing of what HMG was proposing.</p><p>Shortly before this, on 14 February, Brown had seen the governor in London. The FCO minute of the meeting records that Brown was 'exceedingly angry at the situation'. Having been advised that there was 'no division of opinion on our side', he had discovered that both the governor and the British ambassador in Buenos Aires were now saying that the existing British policy could not succeed because of the reaction it would provoke in the Islands. Brown denied that he had been aware of the governor's reports of Island opinion. He resented being put out on a limb and had a suspicion that somebody was 'organising a campaign to upset things'.</p><p>Indeed they were. On 27 February, after they had seen the draft of the Memorandum, four Executive Councillors sent a statement to all Members of Parliament and <em>The Times </em>asking for urgent intervention to prevent HMG making an agreement with Argentina over the heads of the local inhabitants. As they stated: 'you are aware that negotiations are now proceeding between the British and Argentine Governments which may result at any moment in the handing over of the Falkland Islands to Argentina'. Reference was made in the statement to Lord Caradon's strong words in the UN General Assembly in 1965: 'the people of this territory are not to be betrayed or bartered. Their wishes and their interests are paramount and we shall do our duty to protect them'. This, councillors said, contrasted with the silence of ministers 'since 1967'. Conservative parliamentarians rallied to the Falklands cause. Though <em>The Times </em>commented on 12 March 1968 that there was 'no sign that the British Government are contemplating any change from their position up to now', an all-party Falkland Islands Emergency Committee was formed.</p><p>On 15 March <em>The Times </em>, having reported what it described as Lord <a href=\"/biographies/chalfont_alun\">CHALFONT</a>'s 'flaccid equivocations' in defending the government's position in the House of Lords and the optimism of the Argentine Foreign Minister, Costa Mendez, that there might be a favourable outcome to the negotiations, now talked in a leading article 'Betrayal or Barter?' of 'suspicious signs that the Government were contemplating a wholly pointless abandonment of people who believe in them and have trusted them'.</p><p>The next day, 16 March 1968, Brown resigned over a failure of the Prime Minister to consult him, reflecting not only his concern at being left out but his mounting dissatisfaction at the way in which the government was being run. His explosive temperament, not helped by his weak head for alcohol, meant that his departure was greeted with some relief.</p><p>Brown married Sophia Levene in 1941. He died at Truro on 2 June 1980.</p>",

        "body": "<p>explorer, was born in London on 1 August 1867 the son of Samuel Noble Bruce and his wife Mary (Sara), née Lloyd. His father was at that time working in London as a physician, as William's grandfather had moved south to London in 1851 and Bruce went to Norfolk County School and then on to study medicine at London University. This was a result of his father's pressure because his real interest was in natural science, to which he had been introduced by Professor Patrick Geddes during his holidays. He quickly changed from London to Edinburgh so that he could study biology and oceanography under Geddes. Bruce also became involved in the research which was being carried on in Geddes's floating laboratory in Granton Harbour on the Firth of Forth, appropriately known as 'The Ark'. His residence in Edinburgh brought him into contact with two people who would influence his life enormously, firstly HR Mill, later the distinguished librarian of the Royal Geographical Society, and secondly, WG <a href=\"/biographies/burn-murdoch_william\">BURN-MURDOCH</a>, a painter, with whom he shared a room. It was Burn-Murdoch who persuaded him to go on the  <em>Balaena </em>expedition.</p><p>The Dundee whaling expedition of 1892-3  <em>(Balaena) </em>confirmed Bruce's interests in Polar regions and their biology and oceanography. It was on this expedition that he made his first visit to the Falkland Islands. In his book  <em>From Edinburgh to the Antarctic </em>Burn-Murdoch wrote some very vivid accounts of life on the Islands which he described as 'very homely and just like Shetland'. The bird life made an enormous impact on Bruce as did the large number of wrecks lying in the harbour which all told 'of some storm, gale and narrow escape - the dismal side of sea life'. As the  <em>Balaena </em>was the first of the four ships to arrive Bruce had time to do some research, and Burn-Murdoch describes him as 'disappearing with flowing mackintosh, vascular, geological hammer, Jaeger snow cap and shooting boots - the perfect Antarctic pytheas'. There is another vivid description of Bruce playing his pipes in a potato patch. The  <em>Balaena </em>returned again to the Falkland Islands on 27/28 February 1893 when Bruce was amazed to find himself eating gooseberries and redcurrants in February. The expedition was a slight disappointment to Bruce as whaling very much took precedence over science.</p><p>On his return to Scotland, Bruce applied for the job of assistant meteorological observer at the meteorological station placed on the summit of Ben Nevis. He left this job when, in 1896, he was asked to become a member of the Jackson Harmsworth expedition to Franz Josef Land, which was then in its second year. Arctic exploration was very much in fashion and this fashion spread to the Antarctic as a result of the Sixth International Geographical Congress in 1895. The next seven years were to see seven major expeditions - two English, one Swedish, one German, one Belgian, one French and - thanks to Bruce - one Scottish.</p><p>When Bruce launched the Scottish National Antarctic expedition, it was highly disapproved of by the Royal Geographical Society in London and no finance was forthcoming from the British Government. Bruce therefore was financed more or less entirely by the Coats thread manufacturing family, who won immortality with the discovery of Coats Land. The Scottish expedition was extremely well planned and highly successful in achieving its scientific objectives. It cooperated closely with Drygalski and <a href=\"/biographies/nordenskjold_nils\">NORDENSKJOLD</a> to make sure they did not overlap on research of oceanographical and meteorological matters. During the Scottish expedition Bruce visited the Falkland Islands again, firstly from 30 December 1902 to 26 January 1903. The account of the expedition makes little comment on the Islands except to mention the tremendous help they received from the Royal Navy's ships <em>Cambria </em>and  <em>Basilisk </em>and the high price of coal. Bruce returned to the Falkland Islands with the  <em>Scotia </em>on 2 December 1903, staying until 9 December. He again commented on the great help he received and the kindness and hospitality and on the smell of burning peat which hung in the air and made many of them feel at home.</p><p>On his return to Scotland, Bruce immediately set up an oceanographic laboratory at Leith, modelled on the one set up by his friend the Prince of Monaco, in Monaco. But he was completely captivated by polar exploration and he proposed the crossing of the Antarctic continent in 1910/11. Finance was not forthcoming but the idea was taken up by Ernest <a href=\"/biographies/shackleton_sir\">SHACKLETON</a> who was at that time secretary of the Royal Scottish Geographical Society. The rest of Bruce's life was spent in arctic expeditions, leading a series of visits up to Spitzbergen. He formed the Scottish Spitzbergen Syndicate whose purpose was to try to extract coal commercially. This was not a success.</p><p>Bruce married Jessie Mackenzie in 1901 and they had two children: Eillium Alastair (b1902) and Sheila Mackenzie (b1909). He wrote a large number of articles on polar themes as well as the seven-volume report on the scientific results of the  <em>Scotia </em>expedition. He died in Edinburgh on 28 October 1921 and was remembered by all those who knew him as a man of exceptional kindness. His philosophy of life was 'to lift the veil from the unknown, to add to human knowledge in the belief that all knowledge is of value'.</p>",

During a distinguished academic career, Bryce undertook several long journeys in Russia and the Near East, publishing his impressions. He entered politics and served in several Liberal administrations, notably as president of the board of trade (1894-5) and chief secretary for Ireland (1905-6). In 1888 he had published a study of American politics - <em>The American Commonwealth </em>- after several visits to the United States and in 1907 he was posted to Washington as ambassador, where he remained until 1913. During this time, in the last months of 1910, Bryce embarked on a four-month tour of South America, from Peru round to Uruguay, including a stop of one day, 4 October, in the Falkland Islands while sailing from Punta Arenas to Montevideo on board the RMS <em>Oropesa </em>. In his book - <em>South America. Observations and Impressions </em>, published in 1912 - Bryce records his fairly conventional opinion of the Islands. He had never seen 'any inhabited spot that seemed so entirely desolate and solitary and featureless' and he noted that 'the colony is one enormous sheep farm, probably the biggest in the world'. Of Stanley he wrote: 'all was plain and humble, but decent and not without a suggestion of internal comfort', and Government House seems to have cheered him: 'inside we found a cheerful little drawing room with a cheerful blaze in the grate, a welcome sight to those who had not seen a fire during three weeks of almost constant cold'. He walked up Sapper Hill with Acting Governor TAV <a href=\"/biographies/best_sir\">BEST</a>. Although he also visited Argentina ('a nation in the making, not yet made'), Bryce did not mention that country's claim to the Islands.</p><p>Created viscount in 1914, he became an advocate of the League of Nations during World War I and died in Sidmouth on January 1922. He married Marion Ashton in 1889; they had no children.</p>",

        "body": "<p>colonial chaplain, was born on 9 June 1828 in Hampstead, London. He was educated at a private school to a sufficiently high standard to become tutor in a Church school at Bury St Edmunds. With these references and a desire for ordination, but without the wherewithal to go up to university, Bull at 20 years of age was recommended by the Rev AH Duthie of Minster, Kent, as tutor to his brother Captain Duthie's children in Belvidere, Cape Colony, South Africa, and also as catechist in the Knysna district with unofficial sponsorship by the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel (SPG) and the Society for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge. Bull was subsequently engaged at a salary of £60 a year, plus 'free living, lodging and washing', to teach the children, with the hope that he would be ordained a clergyman. From the beginning, his zeal, humility and earnestness were evident. On 30 May, 1848 Bull, who had landed at Plettenberg Bay, rode to Belvidere (a distance of thirty miles), and on the next day, so Captain Duthie reports, 'the children began with Mr. Bull after breakfast'. The children did so well under their young tutor that paterfamilias was slightly put out when Bull announced that he was going to marry Louisa Rex, his employer's sister-in-law, the ninth of 13 children of George Rex. (George Rex was reputed to be the illegitimate son of King George III). Louisa's engagement was the subject of great amusement in the district for she was ten years older than Bull. They were married on Christmas Day 1849, in Holy Trinity Church, Belvidere. Bull and his wife, who was a splendid hostess, were untiring in their work for the church and community - he travelled up to ten miles on a Sunday to conduct services usually in large rooms in private houses, preparing candidates for baptism and confirmation whilst still tutoring the younger Duthie children. On his episcopal visits Bishop Gray of Capetown always spoke highly of Bull's commitment and professionalism. On 8 April 1850 Bull purchased a property in Ashford Grove in the new village of Belvidere and had to move there, but happily this was within walking distance for the Duthie children.</p><p>It was after this that Bull's career became rather chequered. He was ordained deacon in 1851 by the Bishop of Capetown, appointed catechist at Plettenberg Bay, and later curate at St. John's-in-the-Wilderness in the Long Kloof. He never paid his dues on the property at Ashford in full and he ended his stay in the Colony dramatically by being arrested on board ship in Table Bay as he and his wife were about to sail for England (1854). He had apparently passed bills for £100 on Bishop Gray which were not honoured. Somehow this must have been resolved, for Bull became curate of St. Anne's, Soho, was ordained priest by the Bishop of Winchester (acting for London) in 1856 and granted a Lambeth MA by the Archbishop of Canterbury in 1859 before setting sail as colonial chaplain to the Falklands on a salary of £400pa plus £25pa from the Admiralty for conducting a weekly Parade Service for the garrison of 35 Marines which had been brought out in January 1859. Henry <a href=\"/biographies/faulkner_henry\">FAULKNER</a>, the previous chaplain, had died in April that year and Governor <a href=\"/biographies/moore_thomas\">MOORE</a> had to take services during an eight month interregnum. Mr and Mrs Bull arrived in the Colony on 29 December 1859. Bull complained about the religious indifference of the people, there being only seven or eight communicants at that time with the school being taught by a pensioner. Bull immediately accepted the offer of the post of inspector of schools. At that time Stanley had 540 inhabitants, including 210 children. A schoolmaster and schoolmistress arrived in 1860 and in 1862 Governor James <a href=\"/biographies/mackenzie_james\">MACKENZIE</a> forbade Bible reading in school so as not to offend the susceptibilities of non-Anglicans. Bull protested strongly, but in vain, and in 1865 resigned as Inspector of Schools. It was not until 1871 that a new governor (George <a href=\"/biographies/darcy_george\">D'ARCY)</a> allowed Bible reading and reinstated Bull. In addition to keeping an hospitable open house to visiting strangers (mainly seamen,) Mrs Bull ran a Sunday School for the duration of their stay.</p><p>Three years before Bull arrived Governor <a href=\"/biographies/moore_thomas\">MOORE</a> had moved the Church into the east wing of the Exchange Building and made the west wing into a school. In 1862 the Church was named Holy Trinity and Governor Moore transferred responsibility for it to the churchwardens. Bull must have been a keen early photographer for a photograph taken by him of the newly named church appears in the South American Missionary Society Magazine for 1862. However, the churchwardens were unwilling to bear the expense of its maintenance and in 1865 responsibility for the building reverted to the Government. As colonial chaplain Bull was responsible for settlers in Camp, but there was a development on Keppel Island, which had been partly bought and partly leased by the Patagonian Missionary Society, of which Bull had been highly critical at first. He wrote to SPG: 'The practice of gathering natives from Fuegia to Keppel Island will never do, it is like kidnapping them.' He advocated a settlement on the mainland at Woolya. Perhaps this was too hasty a judgement, for less than five months later he was asking if SPG would aid a native school for Stanley. By 1867 Bull had become the honorary secretary of the (re-named in 1865) South American Missionary Society in Stanley. The Rev Waite Hockin <a href=\"/biographies/stirling_waite\">STIRLING</a>, the new superintendent on Keppel, arrived in the Falklands in January 1863. He and Bull soon became firm friends, and on 15 September, 1868 a letter signed by 54 people of Stanley expressing joy at Stirling's nomination as the first bishop was sent to the Bishop of London, no doubt at the instigation of Bull. The newly-consecrated Bishop Stirling was enthroned by Bull in Holy Trinity Church on 14 January 1872. In April 1872, the Bulls sailed for England on leave of absence. In May 1872, Bishop Stirling wrote well of Bull's work to the Archbishop of Canterbury: '...he has had to face some animosity in a small community. If he returns, as a mark of respect I shall make him Archdeacon.' Bull never returned but sent a locum and kept half his salary until resigning in October 1873. Their South African relatives say that the Bulls considered the Falkland Islands appointment was 'virtual banishment' as communication with the outer world was negligible. The 'animosity' may simply have arisen from Bull's principled stand on what he considered to be important Christian matters. There is a Goss family legend that Charles Bull actually 'murdered' Jacob Napoleon <a href=\"/biographies/goss_jacob\">GOSS</a> (who in fact died of apoplexy) and stole all his money.</p><p>Upon resigning as colonial chaplain Bull became vicar of Nankeeling, Hull, 1873-75, vicar of St. Silas, South Lambeth, 1875-77 and then vicar of St. John, North Woolwich from 1877 until his death. Mr <a href=\"/biographies/hocking_james\">HOCKING</a> the gaoler in Stanley wrote to former Governor D'Arcy to complain that Bull still owed him money. In 1872-3 he had entrusted his life savings to Bull who had invested them in the Goss business - which had then gone insolvent. Hocking had only managed to recover £270 of his investment and wanted the rest back from Bull. A letter from Bull explains that he too had suffered loss of £900 and he had only been trying to help Hocking. By July 1882 he was himself in liquidation. The Colonial Office took Hocking's side: 'I think this slippery gentleman [Bull] ought not to escape so easily' minuted one official and Lord Kimberly (Secretary of State) agreed that Bull's pension should be docked by £50 a year until the debt was repaid.</p><p>While Bull lived in London he examined the registers in Kew Chapel as it was believed that the marriage between George III and Hannah Lightfoot, as well as the remarriage of the King and Queen Charlotte, was recorded there. For some reason his search at the Chapel was regarded with suspicion and he had to abandon it before he could find the early dates in which he was interested. An unaccountable fire which broke out in Bull's study not long after his search was probably unconnected, though it was commented on at the time. Bull died in 1884. His wife lived for another five years and died on 23 October 1889. They had no children but at different times adopted three. Two were taken back when their widowed mother contemplated remarriage; the third, who grew up with them and to whom they were greatly attached, was sent back to the Falkland Islands to take up work there shortly before Louisa's death. The 1881 British Census shows an unnamed 13 year old male 'servant, house Boy and Chorister' living with them in Woolwich.</p>",

        "body": "<p>naval officer and expedition leader, was born in Dyserth, Flintshire on 28 September 1927, the second son of Leonard Burley and his wife Edith, née Baker. He was educated at Solihull School and entered the Royal Navy in September 1945. Having served in various ships, including HMS <em>Kenya </em>during the Korean War, he was appointed to the Antarctic guardship, HMS <em>Protector </em>in 1960. After a successful ascent of Mount Liotard, the highest mountain on Adelaide Island off the Antarctic Peninsula, permission was obtained to climb the highest mountain on South Georgia - Mount Paget, 9,625 feet. Burley, in company with three Royal Marines, reached the second-highest peak on 10 December 1960, but bad weather and lack of time forced them to return to their ship.</p><p>This failure rankled and subsequently, partly to redress it, Burley planned and led the Combined Services Expedition to South Georgia in 1964-1965. The expedition came by air through Montevideo and from there in HMS <em>Protector </em>to South Georgia via the Falkland Islands. The expedition had three main aims, run in separate phases. First, to land at King Haakon Bay and retrace and evaluate the route taken by Sir Ernest <a href=\"/biographies/shackleton_sir\">SHACKLETON</a> and his two companions across the Island to Stromness in 1916; to explore possible alternative routes that he might have taken; and to film the journey for ITV (where it featured as part of the 'Survival' series). This was completely successful and the expedition was the first to retrace Shackleton's route. The second aim was to climb Mount Paget, and as many other peaks in that area as could be climbed in the time available. Paget and Mount Sugartop (7,623 feet) were successfully climbed, but attempts on Mounts Fagerli and Paulsen failed narrowly owing to poor snow conditions. The third aim was to complete a large-scale survey of the area to the north of Royal Bay, not covered on the ground during the <a href=\"/biographies/carse_verner\">CARSE</a> surveys of the 1950s, but drawn in by <a href=\"/biographies/bomford_anthony\">BOMFORD</a> to reflect the terrain as best he could. The field work for this was successfully completed on the last day of the expedition and the map later compiled and printed at 42 Survey Engineer Regiment. Some additional geological and ornithological work was also done, mostly during this third phase. Mount Burley in the survey area was subsequently named after him.</p><p>A major achievement of the expedition was the crossing at the end of stage two by the full expedition, with all equipment, including sledges, of the formidable Allardyce range from east to west close to the highest point of the range near Marikoppa (6,035 feet). This was a highly successful expedition in all its phases, in which Burley's positive and cheerful personality was very evident. He proved a superb leader, as was recognised by the subsequent award of an MBE (also awarded to two other members of the expedition). The members of the party were (in their ranks at the time): from the navy and marines, Lt Cdr MK Burley, Lieut SH Down, Control Artificer PC Langdon and Sgt TD Thompson; from the army, Major JDC Peacock, Capt PF Fagan and Sgt TJ Lynch; from the RAF, Sqdn Ldr AH Back, Sgt HG Hutt and SAC JR Chester.</p><p>The expedition returned from South Georgia in HMS <em>Protector, </em>working up the results en route and giving lectures to schools and other bodies around South America. In 1966 Burley was awarded the Cuthbert Peek prize of the Royal Geographical Society for leadership of the Combined Services Expedition to South Georgia. In 1989 a set of South Georgia postage stamps was issued to mark the 25th anniversary of the expedition.</p><p>In 1970-1971, Burley planned and led another Joint Services Expedition, this time to Elephant Island. The expedition made the first topographical survey of the island and completed a comprehensive scientific programme. Burley retired from the navy in the rank of commander in 1973 and then served as bursar at Stowe School until he retired for the second time in 1986. In 1986 he was made a Freeman of the City of London.</p><p>He married Fiona Macdonald at the Canongate Church in Edinburgh in 1965 on his return from South Georgia. They have three daughters: Ailsa (b1966), Leonie (b1969) and Erica (b1972). He presently lives in Suffolk.</p>",

He was educated at Oliphants Collegiate School and the University of Edinburgh, going on to study art at the Academy of Antwerp under Charles Duran and then at Florence, Naples and Madrid. He was nearly 30 and already an active painter by the time he met the explorer WS <a href=\"/biographies/bruce_william\">BRUCE</a>. He came from a reasonably wealthy background and when Bruce met him was living 'in state' at Riddle Court in Edinburgh. Their friendship appears to have been instantaneous and when Bruce asked him to join him on the Dundee whaling expedition of 1892 he only gave Burn-Murdoch two days' notice of sailing (luckily they were both bachelors).</p><p>This expedition comprised three whalers - the <em>Active,  </em>the <em>Diana  </em>and the <em>Balaena -  </em>on which Bruce and Burn-Murdoch were quartered. He brought to this adventure the eyes of an artist and also a lively wit when describing events and scenery. There is an early description of Bruce performing his first operation after the <em>Balaena  </em>had been hove to for 20 days in bad weather. Again, the first Christmas on the ice he described as 'a cold, dreamy, white Christmas morning, beautiful beyond description'. The expedition visited the Falkland Islands from 8 to 18 December 1892 and again from 28 February to 5 March 1893. Burn-Murdoch had some very descriptive passages: 'The appearance of a coast was to us very homely.' He went on to say that <a href=\"/biographies/darwin_charles\">DARWIN</a> must have written his bleak account of the Falklands when suffering from one of his frequent attacks of seasickness. In fact he thoroughly enjoyed the short visit, both for the wildfowling, the hospitality and his ability to play the tune <em>The Perthshire Highlander </em>on his pipes when walking through a potato patch. It is interesting to note that the expedition was not able to catch the fin whale as their harpoons and equipment were not sufficiently robust. He wrote: 'To try our harpoon on this finner, one might as well have tried a dry fly for the Scottish Express.'</p><p>Burn-Murdoch never went back to the Antarctic after his return home but he helped Bruce financially on more than one occasion, and when Bruce was unemployed he arranged for him to be manager of a whaling company based in the Seychelles. Burn-Murdoch did not appear to exhibit widely because of his wealth and it is a pity that his drawings and pictures are not better known since his talents were considerable. His paintings and sketches in his book <em>From Edinburgh to the Antarctic </em>make it one of the best illustrated Antarctic books. He married Jean Usher in 1897; they had no children. Burn-Murdoch died on 19 July 1939.</p>",

        "body": "<p>Spanish naval officer, was born at Ontaneda, Santander, on 1 April 1759, the son of Joaquín Antonio de Bustamante and Clara Ignacia Guerra de la Vega. He enrolled in the Spanish navy as a  <em>guardiamarina* </em>at Ferrol at the age of eleven and after serving in several ships he joined the store-ship  <em>Santa Inés </em>in November 1777, sailing in her to Manila. On the return voyage to Spain she was captured by a British ship on 22 September 1779 and taken to Cork, Ireland, where Bustamante remained until the following year, recovering from the grave wounds received in action. He saw action at the Battle of Cape Spartel on 20 October 1782 against the British fleet commanded by Admiral Howe. On 10 September 1788, shortly after being promoted to <em>capitán de fragata </em>, he and  <em>Capitán de fragata </em>MALASPINA submitted to the Spanish Government a plan for a political and scientific voyage around the world. On the proposal being approved, Bustamante was appointed as commanding officer of the corvette  <em>Atrevida </em>and second-in-command under Malaspina of the expedition, which sailed from Cadiz on 30 July 1789. After calling at Montevideo and Port Egmont in West Falkland, the expedition rounded Cape Horn and worked its way slowly up the west coast of South and North America, during which Bustamante was promoted  <em>capitán de navio </em>and several times acted independently of Malaspina. On 20 December 1791 the expedition sailed for the Philippines, spending the next six months surveying these islands. Thence the expedition called at the British convict settlement at Port Jackson in New South Wales, before setting off across the Pacific once more for Callao. Here Malaspina learnt that Spain was at war with France and decided that the two corvettes should sail independently to lessen the risk of losing all the expedition's records if they should encounter French frigates.</p><p>Bustamante was ordered to proceed to East Falkland to report on the Spanish settlement of Puerto de la Soledad (Port Louis) in Berkeley Sound and then to search for the Aurora Islands, reported in 1762 by a Spanish frigate of that name to lie 35 leagues (105 miles) east of the Falklands. On 23 December 1793 Bustamante sighted Beauchêne Island and passing to the south worked his way cautiously up the south-east side of East Falkland, identifying Shag Rock, south of Lively Island, until he was met by a launch off the entrance to Berkeley Sound, which he entered on Christmas Day, anchoring the following day in Port Louis Harbour. Here he found the snow*  <em>Santa Eulalia </em>, commanded by Don Pedro <a href=\"/biographies/sanguineto_pedro\">SANGUINETO</a>, who was also acting as governor of the Spanish settlement. While parties were sent out daily to survey Berkeley Sound, Bustamante drew up a report on the settlement, which he noted consisted of thirty-eight convicts and 102 seamen, the crew of the  <em>Santa Eulalia.  </em>He commented that very little effort was being made to grow green vegetables and that the prohibition of women in the settlement was an issue much debated by all the Governors of the colony since its foundation. Opinion supporting the ban, however, finally carried the day, against all the dictates of reason and experience. Bustamante commented: 'I will pass over the dreadful offences committed because of the lack of that sex which appears to have been created by Providence solely to prevent them. One cannot but be horrified by such crimes, as repugnant to Nature as they are offensive to civilized society'. Bustamante hoped that the Real Compañía Marítima would set up a large scale fishery (i.e. for whaling or sealing) in the Islands as a counter to the number of foreign ships which Sanguineto reported were visiting the Islands every year for the fishing, resulting not only in the loss of revenue to the Spanish crown, but also surreptitiously killing cattle for food during the winter.</p><p>On sailing from Puerto de la Soledad on 11 January 1794 Bustamante began a search for the Aurora Islands, being convinced of their existence from the  <em>Aurora </em>'s report and subsequent apparent sightings of these islands by other Spanish ships. So when he sighted 'islands' in the approximate position reported by the  <em>Aurora </em>, he accepted them as genuine islands and fixed their position by astronomical observations, and so in due course they found their way onto navigational charts. However, in 1820 James <a href=\"/biographies/weddell_james\">WEDDELL</a> made a comprehensive search for these islands, reaching Bustamante's position in excellent visibility 'without observing the least appearance of land'. Weddell first considered the possibility that Bustamante might have sighted icebergs grounded on Shag Rocks, but concluded that the difference in longitude of 6° between Bustamante's position for the Auroras and the known position of Shag Rocks was too great to admit of this possibility, concluding that Bustamante must have sighted icebergs incorporating earth, similar to ones he {Weddell} had sighted far to the south.</p><p>Bustamante extracted himself with some difficulty from an extensive ice field and duly rejoined Malaspina in Montevideo, returning to Cadiz on 21 September 1794 without further incident, from where he proceeded to Madrid to put in order materials from the voyage for publication. Bustamante was promoted to  <em>brigadier de real armada </em>in September 1795 and in September 1796 was appointed military and political governor of Montevideo and general commander of shipping in the River Plate, taking up his post in February 1797. He was promoted to  <em>jefe de escuadra  </em>on 5 October 1802. Considered as the most effective and popular of all the governors of Montevideo during the Spanish vice-regal period, he was relieved from both posts in January 1804 to take command of a squadron of four frigates carrying treasure from Lima to Spain. He set sail from Montevideo on 9 August 1804 flying his flag on the  <em>Medea </em>. On 5 October the Spanish ships were intercepted near Cadiz by four British frigates tasked to detain the Spanish squadron and take it to England. Bustamante refused to comply and in the ensuing battle the Spanish frigate  <em>Mercedes </em>blew up with a considerable loss of life. The affair created a great stir in Madrid, resulting in Spain declaring war on Britain on 12 December 1804. Bustamante returned to Spain from Plymouth in August 1805. Court-martialled, he was exonerated from all charges and sent to Madrid on 1 June 1807 where he was appointed a member of the Committee for the Defence and Fortification of the Indies. On 29 March 1810 the Council of Seville appointed him  <em>capitán general  </em>of Guatemala and president of its high court. He was promoted to  <em>teniente general de la armada  </em>the same year and took up this post on 15 March 1811, remaining there until 1818 and returning to Cadiz in April 1819. On 9 May 1820 he was appointed director-general of the Navy, a post which he held until August 1822. He died on 10 March 1825 in Madrid.</p>",

        "body": "<p>Yahgan Indian, was born about 1818 and bought for a pearl button by Captain Robert <a href=\"/biographies/fitzroy_robert\">FITZROY</a> in 1830 and given his nickname. With three other Indians, he was taken to England on board HMS <em>Beagle </em>. There they were educated and, before they left, were presented to King William IV and Queen Adelaide. Button stood  out as intelligent and quick to learn. At the end of December 1831, the <em>Beagle </em>set sail again for Tierra del Fuego, with the Indians on board. After an interrupted voyage of 13 months, they were settled at Wulaia, Navarin Island.</p><p>On the first visit by the <em>Allen Gardiner </em>to Tierra del Fuego in November 1855, the missionaries encountered Button, his wife and children. They found that Button still remembered much of the English he had learnt. Finding the Indians' attitudes too threatening, the missionaries departed without taking the Button family with them. In June 1858, <a href=\"/biographies/despard_george\">DESPARD</a>, by now in charge of the Mission, visited Wulaia. He met Button and his wife and persuaded them to come to Keppel Island with the three youngest children. Among them was their son Three Boys, who later was to go to England with <a href=\"/biographies/stirling_waite\">STIRLING</a>. With Button's cooperation, the missionaries began to build up a dictionary of Yahgan words and their meanings. Five months later the Indians were returned to Wulaia.</p><p>When in November 1859 the <em>Allen Gardiner </em>returned another group of nine Indians to Wulaia, without warning other Indians set upon the missionaries and the crew of the mission vessel. Eight were killed and only the cook escaped. At the subsequent enquiry in Stanley, Button gave his deposition in English. It decided that Button did not participate in the massacre of the missionaries, but did share some of the spoils. He had done what he could to alleviate the situation, and had rescued the ship's boats from drifting away. <a href=\"/biographies/okokko\">OKOKKO</a> and Alfred Cole both attested to his innocence of the charge of murder. Later Button was influential in encouraging some of his relatives to spend time at Keppel. Contact was again made with Button in 1863 on Stirling's first trip with <a href=\"/biographies/bridges_thomas\">BRIDGES</a> and Okokko to Tierra del Fuego. Three Boys was among the party who returned to Keppel on the <em>Allen Gardiner </em>. At the beginning of March 1864, Button died, with many other Indians, of an unknown disease.</p><p>Button made an impact on the Europeans who met him. Despard in 1868 described him as about 40 years, 5'1&quot; or 2&quot; tall, broad and straight. His hands, feet, and teeth were small; he had a pleasing look. He was sensitive to slights, affectionate, courteous, cleanly, orderly, good memory, slow to comprehend, taciturn, and avoided hard work.</p>",

        "body": "<p>naval officer and explorer, was born on 8 November 1723, the second son of William, fourth Baron Byron and his third wife Frances, née Berkeley. He joined the Navy in 1737, and as a midshipman sailed in the ill-fated  <em>Wager  </em>on <a href=\"/biographies/anson_george\">ANSON</a>'s voyage round the world in 1740-44. In May 1741 the  <em>Wager  </em>was wrecked on a desolate island off the coast of Chile, and Byron suffered great hardships from hunger and cold before he fell into Spanish hands. After many misadventures he eventually returned to England in 1746. Little of Byron's experiences in those years was known at the time of his appointment to  <em>Dolphin  </em>in 1765, for he only published his  <em>Narrative...of the Great Distresses Suffered by Himself and his Companions </em>in 1768, almost a quarter-century after the event. Like others who sailed with Anson, Byron achieved swift promotion on his return, and became captain in 1746. As commander of the 74-gun  <em>Fame  </em>he distinguished himself in North American waters during the Seven Years War. Although at the end of the war in 1763 he was placed on the half-pay list, his experiences on Anson's voyage and his more recent service made him an obvious choice to command the expedition being planned for the South Atlantic and the Pacific, though his nickname of 'Foulweather Jack' was not a reassuring one.</p><p>Byron's voyage of 1764-66 was the first of the discovery expeditions of George III's reign which were to culminate in Cook's three Pacific voyages, but in essence the expedition was a revival of that planned by Anson in 1749, only to be abandoned because of Spanish objections. Although Byron's secret instructions struck a new note as they proclaimed that 'nothing can redound more to the honor of this Nation as a Maritime Power, to the dignity of the Crown of Great Britain, and to the advancement of the Trade and Navigation thereof, than to make Discoveries of Countries hitherto unknown', the body of his orders contained little that was fresh. Like the aborted expedition of 1749, Byron was to search in the South Atlantic for (the imaginary) Pepys Island before surveying and taking possession of the Falkland Islands. These, he was told, lay between latitudes 50°S and 53°S. He was then to search for three hundred leagues eastward for any previously unknown lands, a reference to the hoped-for southern continent. The motive behind this first part of the voyage was clear, and had been expressed by Anson in the official account of his circumnavigation published in 1748 which pointed out that to acquire the Falklands would 'even in time of peace...be of great consequence to this Nation; and, in time of war, would make us masters of those seas'. From the South Atlantic Byron was to sail through the Strait of Magellan into the Pacific and then north to Drake's New Albion (an ill-defined region stretching, in modern terms, from northern California to British Columbia) where he was to search for the entrance of the Northwest Passage.</p><p> <em>Dolphin  </em>was a 24-gun frigate, among the first Royal Navy vessels to be copper-sheathed, and was accompanied by the  <em>Tamar  </em>sloop. Their crews, unusually, were to be paid double wages, an act of generosity which the Admiralty later regretted as it struggled to avoid it being treated as a precedent for further discovery voyages. The ships left Plymouth in July 1764 under a subterfuge whereby Byron as commodore was officially bound for the East Indies where he was to take command of the station. After calling at Río de Janeiro Byron searched in vain for Pepys Island before sighting the 'high, ragged barren Rocks' of the northwest tip of West Falkland on 12 January 1765. Three days later he reached 'one of the finest Harbours I ever saw in my life', which he named Port Egmont after the first lord of the admiralty. The ships spent almost two weeks in Port Egmont, where the crews picked wild celery and other greenstuffs, hunted seals, penguins and sea-lions, and killed a hundred geese a day, while the surgeon of the  <em>Tamar  </em>planted 'a pritty little garden'. Before leaving, Byron took possession of 'this Harbour &amp; all these Islands' in the name of George III, fired three salutes from the ship, and served the crew an allowance of brandy. He was also careful to note in his journal that Richard <a href=\"/biographies/hawkins_sir\">HAWKINS</a> had already carried out an act of possession in 1593 (actually in 1594). Byron then sailed along the northern coastline of East Falkland to 'a very deep sound', which he named Berkeley Sound, but with 'a prodigious great Swell' threatening to carry the ships onto a lee shore they stood off to the north. If they had sailed up the sound to its head they would have found a French settlement, St Louis, established the previous year by Louis-Antoine de BOUGAINVILLE.</p><p>The rest of the voyage was anti-climactic. Byron made no attempt to search the Atlantic east of the Falklands as he had been instructed; nor, once in the Pacific, did he head north to New Albion. He was back in England by May 1766, having completed the quickest circumnavigation on record. The immediate importance of his voyage lay in his stay at Port Egmont. In a letter of February 1765 to the first lord of the admiralty carried to London in a store ship, Byron had repeated his claim that it was 'One of the finest Harbours in the World', with plentiful supplies of water and wildfowl. He had heard a report that the French had been in the islands 'lately', but he was convinced that as far as Port Egmont was concerned his ships were the first to call there 'since the creation'. Moreover, as he reminded Egmont, the French navigator Frézier in his account of his voyage to the South Seas a half-century earlier had specifically acknowledged that Richard Hawkins was the first discoverer of the Falklands.</p><p>Egmont was not slow to respond. Soon after receiving Byron's report he informed the Duke of Grafton (secretary of state for the northern department):</p><blockquote><blockquote>Falkland Island...is undoubtedly  <em>the Key to the whole Pacifick Ocean </em>. This Island must command the Ports &amp; Trade of Chili, Peru, Panama, Acapulco, &amp; in one word all the Spanish Territory upon that Sea. It will render all our Expeditions in those parts most lucrative to ourselves, most fatal to Spain...Your Grace will presently perceive the prodigious Use hereafter to be made of an Establishment on this Place by that Nation who shall first fix a firm Footing there.</blockquote></blockquote><p>That nation, Egmont was determined, should be Britain, and in September 1765 Captain John McBRIDE with three ships and a company of marines sailed for the Falklands 'to compleat the Settlement begun there [Port Egmont] last year'. The 'Settlement' of 1765 was represented only by the surgeon's little garden, but the British were determined to buttress their claim to the islands with the dual arguments of prior discovery and effective occupation. The stage was set for a contest between Britain, Spain and France that in 1770 took Britain to the verge of war. Three years later Byron's journal of his voyage was printed in the first volume of John Hawkesworth's  <em>Voyages </em>, but because of a certain amount of editorial rewriting Byron seemed to pay more attention to Patagonian giants than to the Falklands.</p><p>Byron's career after his return from the circumnavigation continued its upward momentum, although it finished on an unsuccessful note. He served as governor of Newfoundland from 1769 to 1772, while in 1775 he was promoted to rear-admiral. In 1778 he was made vice-admiral of the White, and sent to American waters to intercept a French fleet commanded by Comte D'Estaing. Byron with twenty-one ships of the line encountered the French fleet off Grenada in July 1779, but too late to save the island from capture, and the subsequent battle was inconclusive. Ill health forced him to return to England, and he was not again employed. He died on 10 April 1786, leaving a wife, Sophia (Trevannion), two sons (the elder the father of George Byron the poet, the younger a captain in the Royal Navy), and three daughters.</p><p>He is remembered by Byron Sound in West Falkland.</p>",

        "body": " <p>foreign secretary, prime minister and baron, was born on 27 March 1912, son of James Callaghan, an Irish CPO in the navy. Educated at Portsmouth North Grammar School he entered the Inland Revenue as a clerk and became increasingly interested in trade union affairs. After service in the navy during World War II he was elected to Parliament for Cardiff South in 1945 and held junior ministerial posts in the Attlee government. He was opposition spokesman for the colonies during the fifties and shadow chancellor of the exchequer. When Labour returned to power in 1964 he served as chancellor and then as home secretary. In opposition again, he was shadow foreign secretary and he assumed this post in the Wilson government of 1974.</p><p>Both as foreign secretary and as prime minister, Callaghan took a continuous interest in Falklands affairs. When he took office the idea of condominium was still being mooted as a basis for further negotiations. The Argentines proposed it as a preliminary to the transfer of sovereignty, while British officials advised that there should be talks on safeguards in the event of joint administration without prejudice to the sovereignty question. It became increasingly unlikely that Islanders would participate in such talks and Callaghan minuted 'Leave this poisoned chalice'. There followed a period of misunderstanding in which the Argentines hoped for further progress and Islander opinion, influenced by the Falkland Islands Committee in London, remained suspicious and hostile.</p><p>While Callaghan was causing Falklands policy to be re-examined, an Argentine newspaper began a campaign advocating the invasion of the Islands. The Argentine foreign minister, Vignes, appeared to support this at a press conference on 19 March 1975. Callaghan, revealing the tough position he was invariably to adopt over possible Argentine military action, instructed the new British ambassador, David Ashe, to threaten 'serious consequences' in the event of unilateral action by Argentina. In May 1975 Callaghan had concluded with Prime Minister Wilson that the best way ahead lay in prompting discussions on economic issues, in particular oil and fisheries. They hoped that collaboration in these areas would postpone discussions on sovereignty, although it was acknowledged that it would have to be discussed eventually. Both Wilson and Callaghan insisted that the views of Islanders were paramount. The Argentines refused to discuss economic collaboration, proposing the lease-back of the Falklands and immediate occupation of the Dependencies. This was in turn rejected.</p><p>Nevertheless Callaghan continued his attempts to interest the Argentines in economic collaboration, including over Lord SHACKLETON's economic survey of the Islands. He refused to discuss sovereignty and maintained his firm stance towards any suggestion of an invasion. Various devices to involve Argentina in the survey were rejected with a warning of 'a head-on collision' and an implied invasion threat. On 3 January 1976 Shackleton and his team arrived from Montevideo in HMS <em>Endurance </em>. Ambassadors were withdrawn.</p><p>Relations remained tense. Callaghan made a conciliatory statement in the Commons on 14 January 1976 but on 4 February an Argentine destroyer fired on and attempted to arrest the RRS <em>Shackleton </em>(Captain <a href=\"/biographies/warne_philip\">WARNE)</a>. This resulted in the further deployment of HMS <em>Endurance  </em>in the South Atlantic which was to occur each year under successive Labour ministers until its withdrawal was announced by the Conservative defence secretary on 30 June 1981.</p><p>The 1976 Shackleton Report, apart from prompting an extreme reaction from the Argentines, was an embarrassment to Callaghan. He had expected it to conclude that the Falklands had no future except in collaboration with Argentina. In the event Shackleton concluded that the Islands had a reasonable future without Argentina provided that they received financial aid from Britain totalling some £14m over five years, including, most importantly £2m to extend the runway at Stanley airfield.</p><p>When Callaghan became prime minister he appointed Anthony Crosland as foreign secretary. Crosland died prematurely in February 1977 and was succeeded by Dr David <a href=\"/biographies/owen_david\">OWEN</a>. The entries for Ted <a href=\"/biographies/rowlands_edward\">ROWLANDS</a>, minister of state under Crosland and Owen, cover the principal Falklands events of Callaghan's premiership. However two events were subjects of controversy in the aftermath of the invasion. Both Callaghan and Owen were concerned at the relevance of each for their reputation and the record of the Labour Government.</p><p>The first was the Argentine military presence, detected by a helicopter from HMS <em>Endurance </em>in December 1976 in Southern Thule, an uninhabited island in the South Sandwich Islands. After protests and negotiations the Argentines withdrew in March 1977 and a proposal for joint scientific cooperation was launched which was still on the table when Callaghan left office. In face of criticism from Mrs Thatcher in Parliament on 3 April 1982, Callaghan made a virtue of necessity by maintaining that his government's dealing with Southern Thule was 'the correct way to handle the problems of the small uninhabited islands - keep the temperature down and do not get boxed in to the point of having to surrender or to fight'.</p><p>The second event was the despatch in December 1977 of a nuclear submarine to Falklands waters, when it seemed that the next round of talks with Argentina to be held later that month in New York would be especially tense. In his memoirs, Callaghan says:</p><blockquote><blockquote>... when it seemed possible that our next round of talks might result in considerable tension, a force was despatched even before the negotiations began, backed by a nuclear-powered submarine with orders to remain submerged and exercise surveillance over the several approaches to the islands. This submarine carried out a very valuable function in observing ship movements in order to assess any build-up that might point to an invasion.</blockquote></blockquote><p>Callaghan goes on: 'We made no formal communication to the Argentines of these precautionary moves but I informed the Head of MI6 of our plans before the ships sailed and it is possible that, as I hoped, some information reached the Argentine Armed Forces'. Lord Franks's report states that 'Cabinet Committee papers show clearly that the forces should remain covert'.</p><p>In his contribution to the Franks Debate (Hansard 26 January 1983) Callaghan declined to be drawn on the question of whether the Argentines had received information that the submarine had been sent. He accepted the view expressed by Franks reiterating his words that 'the Argentine threat receded, and it was agreed after the talks that the naval force could be withdrawn'. He went on to say 'The major issue at that time...was... that we were there. We were in a position ... to buttress our negotiations were they to break down'.</p><p>In the Franks Debate generally Callaghan was highly critical of the way in which Mrs. Thatcher had handled the Falklands situation in the period immediately preceding the conflict, accusing her of 'lack of vigilance and foresight in the months leading up to the invasion' and the Government of 'an error of judgment in preparing to meet an act of aggression'. He concluded: 'But if I must sum up the past decade, I do so by saying that there was a Labour Government who preserved an honourable peace and a Conservative Government who won a costly war'.</p><p>His government lost a vote of confidence in the Commons in March 1979, he was defeated in a general election in May, and he resigned the leadership of the Labour party in 1980. He was made a life peer (Baron Callaghan of Cardiff) after he retired from the Commons in 1987. He died on 26 March 2005.</p>",

He studied at Trinity College Dublin and at Lincoln's Inn in London. He held the appointment of Barrington lecturer on Political Economy to the Dublin Statistical Society, was called to the Irish Bar in 1854 and was counsel to the attorney general for Ireland.</p><p>He was appointed chief magistrate in Hong Kong in 1860 and began a career in colonial administration. From 1861-1867 he was governor of Labuan and consul general for Borneo. In 1871 he was administrator of the government of the Gambia. He was appointed governor of the Falkland Islands in 1876 with a salary of £1,200 plus fees.</p><p>Callaghan arrived in May 1876 succeeding the disorganised Governor <a href=\"/biographies/darcy_george\">D'ARCY:</a> 'poor D'Arcy ought not to be regarded as a responsible being in matters of business,' he noted. The colony had liabilities of £3,973. He proved an efficient governor and an official in London minuted: 'I think that Mr Callaghan deserves praise for the trouble and success with which he has dealt with this subject'.</p><p>Like many governors, he was concerned by the power of the Falkland Islands Company. Writing in London (where he had returned in 1878 after his mother's death) he told the Colonial Office:</p><blockquote><blockquote>I can assure you that I have been no \"Company-phobe\" and since I have been here have done all I could to oblige them and Mr [John Markham] <a href=\"/biographies/dean_john1\">DEAN</a>, but their demands from time to time have been most unreasonable. These two interests will before long become a formidable and troublesome power to the government if some effort is not made to bring them to their proper bearings.</blockquote></blockquote><p>The following year he wrote a confidential despatch giving an interesting account of the power of monopolists [FIC &amp; Dean] in the colony and the detrimental effect they had on colonists' wish to save money. Their mails contract had reinforced the power of the FIC. 'If the present state of things is allowed to continue the colony will never progress nor prosper'. Callaghan was disturbed that on his leave <a href=\"/biographies/bailey_arthur\">BAILEY</a>, who had been left in charge, 'from his long residence here has become too subject to local influences to be able to withstand the strong pressure put upon him [by the land-owners]'. He believed that FE <a href=\"/biographies/cobb_frederick\">COBB</a> was guilty of sharp practice in inducing Bailey to grant land to the FIC in 1879 just before Callaghan himself returned from leave.</p><p>In July 1879, Callaghan asked for a transfer on account of his wife's health. In 1880 he became governor of the Bahamas and was still in service when he died in New York on 8 July 1881. A road in Stanley is named after him.</p>",

        "body": "<p>sheep farmer, was born in London on 26 October 1900, the third son of William Keith <a href=\"/biographies/cameron_william\">CAMERON</a> and Ellen Maria, née Eddols. He was educated at Cheam School, Dartmouth Naval College and Eton.</p><p>His father wanted him to take over the management of Port San Carlos and he spent his first season there in 1922/23, accompanied by his elder brother, Donald. At the beginning of the following season, they crossed to Patagonia to visit Lochiel, the <em>estancia  </em>in Santa Cruz province established by their father in partnership with the <a href=\"/biographies/greenshields\">GREENSHIELDS</a> family. In order to gain experience, NKC then worked as a cadet at Los Yngleses, the Gibson family <em>estancia </em>in Buenos Aires province and also spent time in New Zealand. In 1929 he returned to the Falklands to take over the management of the farm.</p><p>One of his first actions on his return was to change the name by which the farm was known, to try and end the confusion between the <a href=\"?q=node/62\">BONNER</a> farm, which was known as San Carlos and the Cameron farm which was known as San Carlos North. He wrote to government requesting that in future San Carlos North should be known as Port San Carlos. Although this helped somewhat, confusion continued to arise and the two farms were more colloquially referred to by the initials of their founders, J.B. and K.C., or simply spoken of as 'Bonner's' and 'Cameron's'.</p><p>One of the challenges NKC had to deal with during his first years in farming was the economic depression of the early 1930s, which badly affected the wool market. Government instituted a loan scheme to assist farmers and Port San Carlos submitted an application. In his report DS Weir, the agricultural adviser, wrote:</p><blockquote><blockquote>I am of the opinion that a loan...would be a good investment for the Government....Mr.Cameron, who is an excellent manager permanently residing on the property, would thus be enabled to carry out a general scheme of improvement.....Port San Carlos might well become a demonstration area for the rest of the Colony, in matters pertaining to sheep farming generally, as Mr.Cameron is a young man of wide experience and progressive ideas.</blockquote></blockquote><p>While devoting most of the 1930s to building up the farm, NKC was also involved in community affairs. In 1935 he was made a JP and appointed to LegCo for a term of five years, renewed in 1940 for a further five. He served as chairman of the Stanley Sports Association and was awarded the King's Silver Medal at the time of the Coronation in 1937. He also had the honour, in November 1934, of being, as the <em>Penguin </em>reported, 'the first civilian passenger by air in the Falklands', travelling from Stanley to San Carlos in one of the two seaplanes attached to HMS <em>Exeter. </em></p><p>In World War II, leaving Port San Carlos in the capable hands of Chris <a href=\"/biographies/andreasen_christian\">ANDREASEN</a>, NKC returned to Britain during the mid (southern) winter of 1940 and joined the Coldstream Guards. He saw active service in Italy, was mentioned in despatches and rose to the rank of major, becoming adjutant of the 3rd battalion. In 1945 he married Rose Anne Henniker Heaton, eldest daughter of Sir Herbert <a href=\"/biographies/henniker_heaton\">HENNIKER HEATON</a> and in 1946 they returned to the Falklands, where NKC once again took up the management of the farm. In 1949 he was appointed to ExCo and served for three successive five-year terms. He was awarded an OBE in 1953 and a CBE in 1963. He and his wife had four children, Jane (b1950) Alastair (b1951) Donald (b1953) and Susan (Sukey) (b1956).</p><p>Partly due to the Korean War, the 1950s saw a boom in wool prices, which enabled farmers in the Falklands to substantially invest in their land for the first time in many years. NKC was keenly interested in subjects such as grasslands improvement and sheep breeding and greatly enjoyed discussions with visiting specialists. He also believed that the future development of the Falklands would be dependent on a programme of road building and that without good communications no real progress would be possible in the long term.</p><p>In many ways NKC was ill-suited to the life of a Falklands sheep-farmer. He was a gentle, sociable man, who loved history and the classics of English literature and would have enjoyed an academic career. He always carried a book in his pocket on long rides and was particularly devoted to the works of Anthony Trollope and James Boswell. His other principal interest in life was fly-fishing and taking a house near a good trout or salmon river was a priority when on leave in Britain, preferably in Scotland, a country for which he had a great fondness. In the years after World War II he introduced brown trout into the San Carlos River and was delighted by their gradual metamorphosis into huge sea trout.</p><p>In 1965 NKC retired as manager of Port San Carlos and returned to Britain, eventually settling with his wife in her birthplace, Ireland, where he died on 2 January 1971. His old friend, Arthur Grenfell <a href=\"/biographies/barton_arthur\">BARTON</a> paid tribute to him on Falkland Islands radio:</p><blockquote><blockquote>He was a wonderful conversationalist and correspondent, with an infectious sense of humour. Though not a Kelper by birth, he was a true Kelper in every other respect and supported the Islands' cause magnificently in 1968 when the sovereignty issue became critical. Some of those who spent a lifetime at Port San Carlos have already passed on, but there are still many employees, past and present, who valued him highly as a Boss. This sentiment was well-expressed in one of the many telegrams of sympathy sent to his widow and family: \"The flag is at half-mast for a man who held the respect and affection of all at Port San Carlos\". Never were truer words spoken.</blockquote></blockquote><p>After NKC's death, his wife Anne took his place as managing director of the family company that owned Port San Carlos. She continued in this role, with regular visits to the Islands, for almost twenty years, until in 1989 the farm was sold to government for subdivision. Anne Cameron died in County Kerry in 2002.</p>",

        "body": "<p>sheep-farmer, was the second of five children of Donald Cameron and his wife Flora, née Kemp, of Gairloch in Ross-shire. His parents later moved to Dumfriesshire, where his father was a gamekeeper on the Drumlanrig Estate. As a young man WKC also trained as a gamekeeper, but in 1867 he was recruited by the Falkland Islands Company, who had an agent in Dumfries. Poor economic prospects in Scotland sent many young men from this part of the world overseas in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries and they formed a large proportion of the Company's workforce, easily adapting to the landscape and climate of the Falklands. The minutes of the FIC London Directors meeting of 29 May 1867 record the submission of an Agreement with ' <em>William Cameron, Storekeeper and Teacher for Darwin Harbour </em>'. WKC sailed from Swansea early in June 1867 on the barque  <em>Epsilon </em>, which also carried seven other passengers, a cargo of coal, and general stores. The cost of his passage (£18) like those of many other emigrants, had been paid by the Colonial Land and Emigration Commissioners, who were keen to encourage new settlers in the Colonies. The ship arrived in the Falkland Islands on 12 August after a voyage of 67 days.</p><p>In April 1868, eight months after his arrival at Darwin, WKC wrote to his elder brother Norman, who had remained in Scotland, a description of his life in the Falklands:</p><blockquote><blockquote>I still continue to like this place well enough. There is not much society. There are about 12 wooden houses in the settlement of which I occupy one and the shepherds' houses are scattered up and down the camp...I very often take a turn out into the camp, of course on horseback. No one thinks of walking here. At first I was a very poor equestrian, but now I can ride like a gaucho...it is a very healthy country. I have not had a day's illness since I came.</blockquote></blockquote><p>Even at this early date, WKC's thoughts were already turning to the prospects for sheepfarming. He continues the letter 'I see that they are advertising farms to let. The sheep farming is not paying ...owing to the number of sheep that die every year with scab*. They lose about half of them that way'. He encounters William Wickham <a href=\"/biographies/bertrand_william\">BERTRAND</a> and his companion John Switzer, also investigating the possibilities: 'There were two men from New Zealand out here about a week ago, looking at the land. I think they are going to take farms. They crossed over here from Monte after crossing the Andes from Chilli.'</p><p>In 1871 WKC moved to Stanley at the request of FE <a href=\"/biographies/cobb_frederick\">COBB</a>, the Company's young colonial manager, who had also arrived in the Islands for the first time in 1867, only six days before WKC himself. William Markham Dean wrote in his history of the Company that 'W.K.Cameron was ...a great favourite with Mr. Cobb from his first arrival'. In his annual report for 1871 Cobb recorded that 'I found it necessary to dismiss the [Stanley] storekeeper ... and to give the care of the store to Mr. W.K. Cameron from Darwin Harbour, a very intelligent and trustworthy man.'</p><p>In May 1875 however, Cobb had to admit to the Directors that storekeeping was not WKC's forte:</p><blockquote><blockquote>I feel it to be my duty to say that I think the Directors would do well to engage another Storekeeper for Stanley.... Mr. Cameron, as you know, came here as Darwin Storekeeper in 1867 and was promoted in 1871. With every desire to do his best, pleasant and genial in manner so that he is generally a favourite, an excellent sportsman and the best shot in the Falkland Islands, he yet lacks the ability to handle the store well and his previous training - he was a gamekeeper - was not calculated to fit him for such a sedentary post...In fact he was built for out of door pursuits and his occupation is anything but a congenial one to him.</blockquote></blockquote><p>An amicable parting of ways must have been arranged, as Cobb wrote again to the Directors in August 1875: 'Mr. Cameron on leaving the Company will join A. Petaluga and Mr. Smith in a sheep venture and has undertaken to purchase 1,000 sheep next autumn'. Edward Smith had arrived in the Falklands in 1873 as stipendiary magistrate. Andrez <a href=\"/biographies/cameron_william\">PITALUGA</a> was one of the most successful cattle farmers in the Islands and held leases on extensive tracts of land in East Falkland. However, neither had experience of sheep-farming and it was to this that WKC turned his attention. He made his headquarters at Port San Carlos (then known as San Carlos North, or confusingly simply as San Carlos, which name was also used of the <a href=\"?q=node/62\">BONNER</a> family's land on the south side of the river) and began to build up a settlement there. One of his first aims was to tackle the scab he had noticed at Darwin as being such a threat to sheepfarmers. Governor <a href=\"/biographies/callaghan_jeremiah\">CALLAGHAN</a> wrote in his Colonial Annual Report for 1877:</p><blockquote><blockquote>I regret to say that the ravages of scab were as usual very severe during the year.... I am informed that 'dipping' of sheep ...has become more general of late years... The dip most in use in the Islands ... is the 'tobacco dip'...it is, however, very expensive...Mr. Cameron has kindly given me the receipt of a dip prepared from lime and sulphur which he has used very successfully at the San Carlos Station ... where the sheep are reported to be exceptionally clean.</blockquote></blockquote><p>In 1878 Andrez Pitaluga died, leaving eight children and a widow, Margaret, who herself died the following year. Alexander Pitaluga, then aged 26, took over management of his father's estate, basing himself at Salvador. WKC gradually built up the sheep stocks at Port San Carlos and by 1881 the FIC estimated shipping 140 bales of wool from 'Smith &amp; Cameron'. Around this time, WKC invited his nephew John Gibson Cameron, known as 'Jack' to come from Scotland to help with the farm. In 1884 Alexander Pitaluga sold the leases held by his family in the Port San Carlos area to WKC, who undertook to pay outstanding rent arrears. There were apparently accusations of improper dealings, because in 1887 Alexander Pitaluga and three of his siblings ratified the agreement in a second deed.</p><p>In 1891 WKC applied to purchase his leaseholds, but permission was refused by the new governor, <a href=\"/biographies/goldsworthy_sir\">GOLDSWORTHY</a>, who had decided that government would retain some of the most valuable parts of the land formerly leased to, and developed by, the pioneering farmers, to sell to new applicants. This understandably incensed most of the existing leaseholders, who stood to lose the best of the land they had invested in, and WKC banded together with others to appeal to the secretary of state. Their appeal was allowed and Goldsworthy defeated, but farmers were still only permitted to renew their leases rather than purchasing.</p><p>In spite of his difference of opinion with government, WKC was made a JP in 1892. He continued to develop the farm. The  <em>Falkland Islands Magazine </em>of February 1891 described the arrival of a freezer ship, the  <em>Hengist </em>, at Port San Carlos with <em> </em>'materials for the erection of killing and hanging sheds, cook-house and refrigerating works there'. Two years later the enterprise seemed to be developing well and the  <em>Magazine  </em>for June reported that:</p><blockquote><blockquote>The 'Hengist' left San Carlos for London on June 5 with her fourth cargo of frozen mutton from the Falklands. She had over 16,000 carcasses on board from the East and West Falklands. At San Carlos this season a Tryworks has been erected, thereby enabling the farmers on the East to have the offal boiled down, which had formerly been thrown on the beach.</blockquote></blockquote><p>Around this time WKC also purchased, in partnership with James Greenshields, an estancia in Patagonia, which he named 'Lochiel' after the Clan Cameron home ground in Scotland. He began exporting sheep from Port San Carlos to stock the new farm. In July of 1899 the Falkland Islands Magazine reported that 'The 'Albatros' arrived at San Carlos (N) on April 29th: she commenced loading at 2 p.m. and finished at 5 p.m., having taken on board 1340 sheep. She also took in 70 tons of water and left early ... for Camarones Bay.' (This was the site of Lochiel Station in Santa Cruz Province).</p><p>During the 1890s WKC began to hand over management of the farm to his nephew Jack, who had married in 1891 Frances Williams, sister of Louis <a href=\"/biographies/williams_louis\">WILLIAMS</a>. WKC had himself married Ellen Maria, née Eddolls, of Bristol and four children, Donald, Alastair, Norman <a href=\"/biographies/cameron_norman\">CAMERON</a> and Una were born to them between 1894 and 1902 in London, where WKC now based himself. However he continued to visit the Falklands and Patagonia, where William Markham Dean encountered him. 'W.K.Cameron was a tall, fine-looking man...he was a great sportsman and a fine snipe shot. I was fortunate to travel with him up the Argentine coast to Camarones Bay in 1902 on a visit to his Lochiel Station, when he thrilled us with his tales of cattle killing'. In 1906 WKC applied to Executive Council for permission to purchase the land currently leased by him and, like many other Falklands farmers who also applied during that period, was finally able to buy the freehold.</p><p>After his retirement to England, he still visited the Falklands and continued to support local bodies such as the Stanley Sports Association and the King Edward VII Memorial Committee. He remained friends with FE Cobb and in 1919 helped him set up the Falkland Islands Battle Memorial Fund. In London he became a leading light of the Caledonian Society. He died in an accident at Knightsbridge Underground station on 6 December 1920.</p><p>The farm at Port San Carlos continued to be colloquially referred to as 'K.C.'- for Keith Cameron - after WKC's death. (Just as San Carlos, across the estuary, was also known by the owner's initials as 'J.B.' for Jack Bonner). The farm bale stencil remained as WKC until Port San Carlos was sold for subdivision in 1989. Cameron's Ridge and Cameron's Brook, named after the family, lie just south of the settlement on the other side of the San Carlos river.</p>",

        "body": "<p>pilot, was born in Stanley on 28 November 1933, the youngest child of Thomas Watson Campbell and Marion Anne, née Binnie. His childhood was a contented one - he attended the Government School and received good grades in all subjects. He was 13 when his father died and the loss had a huge impact on him. At the age of 16 he was apprenticed to the FIC as a carpenter under the guidance of Percy Dixon. He joined the Boys' Brigade in his early teens and wholeheartedly enjoyed all the Brigade offered, especially the physical training, becoming expert in parallel bar work. At 19 he was promoted lieutenant and relished the responsibilities which that involved.</p><p>The turning point in Campbell's life came towards the end of 1954 when he was accepted for the position of student pilot with FIG. His five-year carpentry apprenticeship was due to finish in November 1954, so the timing was perfect and he joined FIGAS on 1 January 1955. John Huckle and Jim Kerr became influential in Campbell's life, tutoring him in the theory of flying. A small Auster seaplane which was no longer used for passenger carrying was used for practical tuition. After 12 hours of flying his private licence was issued and he continued to study and fly in preparation for moving to England to finalise his commercial licence.</p><p>He married local girl Nadine Evans on 12 July 1956 and they left the Islands two days later for training which started in Hamble (Hants) in September. He earned his commercial pilots' licence in February 1957 after completing his cross-country out of Stansted airport. The couple returned to the Islands in April 1957. After a conversion from landplane to Beaver seaplane, Campbell settled in to flying in the Islands for FIGAS; over the years he flew 11,000 hours and never lost his enthusiasm for doing the job he loved. In 1973 he was awarded the MBE, which almost everyone in the Islands celebrated.</p><p>In the 1960s Campbell purchased the MV <em>Redwing </em>from Port San Carlos and in his off-duty time spent many happy hours relaxing on the small cutter. At weekends he would often make trips up Berkeley Sound and annually he and a friend visited various parts of the Islands, including one memorable trip to the Jason Islands from West Point in the summer of 1973.</p><p>Ian and Nadine Campbell went on overseas leave in June 1976, returning in September. Five weeks later on 14 October 1976, Campbell's Beaver seaplane was reported overdue on a flight from Brenton Loch to Stanley. A search was mounted and the only passenger on the flight was located on a small island in Mare Harbour within 24 hours. Some 19 days later, Campbell's body was recovered from the sea in the same area, thanks to the tenacity of a group of local divers. His funeral was held on 5 November at Christ Church Cathedral, Stanley, where he had been baptised, confirmed and married.</p><p>The circumstances of the crash were never satisfactorily explained and aroused deep public concern, which was aggravated by Governor <a href=\"/biographies/french_neville\">FRENCH</a>'s maladroit handling of the enquiry. The British Accident Investigation Branch sent two inspectors down to investigate the accident. Their report noted Campbell's flying experience and concluded: 'The accident was caused when the passenger, who was flying the aircraft, lost control during a landing manoeuvre which caused the aircraft to stall, capsize and sink'.</p><p>Campbell was a charismatic Islander who loved his homeland and its people and with his infectious charm endeared himself to all who knew him. In a despatch to London, the succeeding Governor, James <a href=\"/biographies/parker_james\">PARKER</a>, described him as 'the only Islander pilot in the internal air service, a hero to his people'. The FIG honoured his memory by naming a street in Stanley after him.</p>",

        "body": " <p>Spanish naval officer. Ramón de Carassa entered the Spanish navy as a  <em>guardiamarina </em>on 19 February 1758. After successive promotions he was promoted  <em>teniente de fragata  </em>on 13 January 1771 and in this rank he was appointed in command of the schooner  <em>Santa Engracia </em>on 14 July 1774, sailing in her to Vera Cruz and later to Buenos Aires, from where he was sent to the Falklands as  <em>comandante gobernador  </em>of the Spanish settlement at Puerto de la Soledad (Port Louis), taking over as governor on 19 February 1777 when Govenor <a href=\"/biographies/gil_de\">GIL</a> (whose relief for health reasons had been granted six months earlier) was eventually able to leave Puerto de la Soledad. Carassa's tenure was an eventful one. In 1778 Vertiz, viceroy of Río de la Plata, proposed the transfer of the governor's seat from Puerto de la Soledad to Port Egmont (Puerto de la Cruzada), arguing that it offered greater advantages as it was at a shorter distance from the mainland. The King did not agree, considering that the small army garrison of 30 men and a ship of the Spanish Navy should prevent foreign encroachment. Consequently while fulfilling the usual administrative duties as governor, Carassa was specifically instructed to prevent any attempt by foreigners, especially the British, to set up an establishment in the islands. In particular he was to reconnoitre Port Egmont and destroy any buildings and fortifications found there, to ensure that 'pirates' did not have an opportunity to settle there. In February two snows*, the  <em>San Cristóbal </em>and the  <em>Gloria, </em>with the sumaca* <em>Nuestra Señora de Olivera </em>were dispatched with stores and further instructions for the governor. On 5 June 1778 Carassa informed the viceroy of the loss by shipwreck of the sumaca  <em>San Antonio, </em>and on 18 June 1778 he reported his inability to carry out the yearly examination of Port Egmont, as required by the King, because at the appropriate season no ship had arrived for that purpose. However, from information brought by the  <em>Gloria </em>, shipwrecked in the vicinity of that port, he was confident that, since the previous examination in April 1777, there were neither inhabitants there nor any signs that any had returned. In November 1779 he was relieved by Salvador de <a href=\"/biographies/medina_juan\">MEDINA</a>. Carassa's final promotion was to  <em>capitán de navío  </em>on 11 March 1786.</p>",

        "body": "<p>governor, was born at Ardleigh near Colchester, Essex on 21 March 1887, the third son of Durrant Edward Cardinall and Norah Louise of Tendring in the north-east of the county where the Cardinalls were a long-established landed family. He was educated at Winchester and at the University of Heidelberg in Germany and then taught in preparatory schools in British Columbia and in England; during his time in Canada he also worked briefly as a journalist with the Vancouver News Advertiser. In 1914 he joined the West African Administrative Service, as it then was, spending eighteen years in the Gold Coast {Ghana}; most of his service was up-country in Ashanti, the Northern Territories and that part of the former German colony of Togoland which was governed by Britain under a League of Nations mandate. His African experiences led to several books, <em>Natives of the Northern Territories of the Gold Coast </em>(1920), <em>In Ashanti and Beyond </em>(1927), <em>Tales Told in Togoland </em>(1931), <em>The Gold Coast </em>(1931, 1933), <em>A Bibliography of the Gold Coast </em>(1933) and <em>A Gold Coast Library </em>(1954). Like so many colonial administrators he developed an interest in anthropology and gave several artefacts to the Pitt-Rivers Museum at Oxford.</p><p>He retired from the West African service in 1932 and went on to represent Great Britain at the League of Nations on behalf of the Togoland mandate in 1932 and 1933. This was followed by a move to the Colonial Service mainstream when he was appointed commissioner of the Cayman Islands, then a dependency of Jamaica, in 1934. Like so many of the smaller British island territories the Caymans were a backwater, dependent on shipbuilding, fishing and farming and a far cry from the offshore banking and tourist centre of today. Cardinall's term of office began when the islands were still recovering from the effects of a hurricane in 1932 and economic depression was widespread all over the Western world. There were no roads; access to most places was by boat, on foot or on horseback. Cardinall's first step was to improve external communications by encouraging the opening of a wireless station; this was done by the Cuban government in George Town in 1935, originally to monitor the weather, and it was followed by the establishment of a station on Cayman Brac. In 1935, too, he was responsible for the first roadbuilding programme in the islands, even surveying some of the planned lines of route himself. One cattle trail in George Town itself is now one of the main streets of the capital and bears his name, Cardinall Avenue. He was also ahead of his time in seeing the potential of tourism, founding the Chamber of Commerce, a regatta and a yacht club in 1935 and arranging for the first visit of a cruise liner in 1937. Steps were taken to promote such local industries as shark fishing and tanning and a small hospital was built along with a library and a post office. It is fair to say that the present prosperity of the Cayman Islands owes a great deal to the foundations laid by Allan Cardinall in the 1930s; a recent historian, Michael Craton, describes him as among 'the most capable, eloquent and vigorous of all Cayman's Commissioners'.</p><p>In 1940 Cardinall was transferred to the Falklands as colonial secretary and when Sir Herbert <a href=\"/biographies/henniker_heaton\">HENNIKER HEATON</a> left the following year he replaced him as governor. He was in office for the rest of World War II; from 1942 a large garrison, officially designated Force 132, was stationed in the Islands because of fear of a Japanese attack across the Pacific and it remained there until 1944. A military force of 1700 men encamped on the outskirts of Stanley and without the threat of imminent hostilities to concentrate the mind was obviously a potential source of problems but there were no serious incidents. At the end of 1941 Cardinall had to order the evacuation of most of the children from Stanley to the camp; the excuse was the Japanese threat following Pearl Harbour but the real reason appears to have been the need to provide billets for the advance units of the garrison. The children returned in October 1942.</p><p>Cardinall's watch also saw Operation Tabarin*, forerunner of the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey (now the British Antarctic Survey) launched in 1943. Tabarin in turn stemmed from action taken to prevent enemy warships using harbours in the Falkland Islands Dependencies and to monitor the Antarctic ambitions of Argentina and Chile; several scientific bases were established and Cardinall and David <a href=\"/biographies/roberts_david\">ROBERTS</a>, the FIC colonial manager, took a considerable risk in sending the Company's steamer <em>Fitzroy </em>to accompany RRS <em>William Scoresby </em>to the Antarctic. The <em>Fitzroy </em>was the Falklands' only link with the outside world and was neither designed nor insured to go into Antarctic waters; the secrecy of the project meant that neither the insurers nor the Company's headquarters in London could be informed. Fortunately <em>Fitzroy </em>returned safely. Cardinall's support of the operation is commemorated in Mount Cardinall in Graham Land (the Antarctic Peninsula).</p><p>He had moved to another remote island colony with economic problems but those of the Falklands were very different from those he had faced and tackled in the Caymans. The problems here stemmed from an agriculture which was almost exclusively based on sheep ranching carried out in very large units, most of which were owned by absentee landlords, above all the Falkland Islands Company. Some governors, especially <a href=\"/biographies/allardyce_sir\">ALLARDYCE</a> and <a href=\"/biographies/middleton_sir\">MIDDLETON</a>, had attempted to introduce new thinking but there was never any degree of continuity between the term of one governor and that of his successor. In 1937 Governor Henniker-Heaton, with the support of some of the more progressive farm managers, had invited the grassland expert William <a href=\"/biographies/davies_william\">DAVIES</a> of Aberystwyth to report on the grasslands and Davies was not impressed by what he found; he felt that the existing position was beyond improvement and he recommended the breakup of the existing pattern of large ranches and its replacement by 6000 acre paddocks. Despite the support of the governor, Davies's proposals were not implemented; this was due in part to the outbreak of war but also to the conservatism and sometimes the outright hostility of the farming community.</p><p>Cardinall set about preparing a development plan for the Falklands for the next fifty years; this was contained in a 75-page despatch sent to the Colonial Office and dated 22 February 1942. One must marvel at his audacity in preparing such a plan for one of the most remote British territories with a population of only 2000 during a world war and in a year which would see the collapse of the British Empire in the Far East. In his despatch Cardinall argued that the 6000 acre holdings proposed by Davies were too small for ranching and too large for conventional farming. Ranching and the consequent over-grazing of unmanaged grassland, coupled with the conservatism of many of the men on the spot, were the causes of environmental deterioration. The farming companies, answerable to shareholders in London, and the Falkland Islands Company were among the main factors holding back any attempts at development; one of the greatest mistakes had been the closure by Governor <a href=\"/biographies/hodson_sir\">HODSON</a> of the experimental farm established by Governor Middleton. Cardinall was equally critical of the failure of the Colonial Office to challenge local vested interests and his proposals show that he had studied contemporary ideas and practice in Denmark with the emphasis on cooperatives.</p><p>His suggestions for agrarian reform involved a level of social and economic change which, in the Falklands context, can only be described as revolutionary. He advocated the breakup of the existing farms and their replacement by smaller units held on cooperative tenancies on the Danish model. He saw the need to keep more intelligent and enterprising young people on the land and to train them to see farming as a satisfying and fulfilling life; to that end he proposed to re-establish the experimental farm (at Albemarle rather than on its original site at Green Patch) alongside a new agricultural high school. This would be attended by boys between the ages of 14 and 19; they would then be employed on farms as skilled agricultural workers until they were 35 when they would move on to their own smallholdings. They idea was to give workers, especially in the Camp, a stake in the community and in the long term to create a contented and prosperous rural society of yeoman farmers.</p><p>The plan also dealt with infrastructure. There were no roads outside Stanley and its immediate vicinity and Cardinall proposed an east-west highway across East Falkland. An inter-island shipping service and a ferry across the Sound would end dependence on FIC shipping and also, it was hoped, reduce the risk of rural depopulation by making Stanley more accessible to Camp residents. A local air service had been suggested before the war and had been rejected on grounds of cost but Cardinall revived the idea. Diversification based on other natural resources was mentioned and the presence of oil and its future exploitation could not be ruled out. A more representative form of government was needed (it is worth remembering that no Falkland Islander had a vote until after World War II) and Cardinall also suggested the possibility of full integration with the United Kingdom, with the Islands becoming an English county. The cost of these proposals was estimated at about £500,000 to be funded by Colonial Development loans and tax increases; the despatch also stressed that continuity of policy was essential and, by implication, that the implementation of such a plan could not be allowed to depend on the whim of individual governors.</p><p>The plan was not received with great enthusiasm by the Colonial Office. Colonies, especially the smaller ones, were expected to pay their way and not to demand large capital sums by way of investment. One comment described Cardinall's proposals as 'a Scandinavian-style socialist utopian dream' and he himself admitted that his plan was 'a vast gamble'. To be fair to the Colonial Office there was a world war in progress and officials were already aware that far-reaching decisions about the future of many colonies would have to be taken after the end of hostilities; compared with many colonies, the Falklands really were a very small problem. The experimental farm was approved and some funds were made available but the nettle of land reform was not grasped and neither the Falkland Islands Company nor the farming interests were confronted. The price for London's failure to respond to Cardinall's 1942 despatch was paid in later years. On the other hand, some of his ideas were implemented by his successor Miles <a href=\"/biographies/clifford_sir\">CLIFFORD</a> who received the credit. The despatch and the accompanying file disappeared from public view until their release in 1972. It is interesting that much of what Cardinall had proposed was included in the Shackleton Reports of 1976 and 1982 and has by now come to pass, although Lord <a href=\"/biographies/shackleton_edward\">SHACKLETON</a> had never seen the despatch; this indicates how perceptive Cardinall was.</p><p>Sir Allan Cardinall (he was made KBE in 1943, having been awarded the CMG in 1937) left the Falklands in 1946 and retired to Romsey in Hampshire. He never married. His last years were overshadowed by ill health and he died on 26 January 1956 at the age of 68; not long before his death he was received into the Roman Catholic church. If his plans could have been implemented he might have been remembered as one of the outstanding governors; it was his misfortune to be in office during the more difficult years of the twentieth century. He comes over as a man of great intelligence and vision, too intelligent and dynamic, perhaps, for the time and place in which he found himself. This author's father, who worked closely with him, certainly had a great respect for him.</p><p><a href=\"/biographies/hynes_william\">See Image 196</a></p>",

Her parents were Charles Carey, an ex-Royal Marine who became chief of police and Ellen Elizabeth, née Rudd. Maude became a pupil teacher at the Government School in Stanley on 2 March 1903 and took up employment as post office clerk on 3 August 1920, rising to first clerk under Mr G L Brown, postmaster. She was appointed to the post of colonial postmaster on 1 January 1934, the first lady postmaster in the British Empire.</p><p>She maintained a correspondence with a number of keen collectors of Falkland Islands and Dependency stamps including Dr David Nabarro, Dr Dudley Stone, James Andrews and Captain Bernard S H Grant, and her neat italic handwriting is familiar to collectors to this day. She went out of her way to provide details of each new issue of stamps, which was very fortunate as the records and much local information were lost in the Town Hall fire in April 1944.</p><p>In 1928 there was a shortage of ½d and 2½d stamps in South Georgia and permission was given to surcharge a number of 2d stamps with a locally made hand stamp bearing 2½d. For this provisional issue there was an immediate worldwide demand. Maude Carey went out of her way to help her friends. To Captain Grant she wrote,</p><blockquote><blockquote>I addressed so many envelopes to you. Unfortunately they arrived with the consignment of stamps, and the issue was withdrawn. As a very great favour he [Nelson-Jones, the South Georgia postmaster] did four for me or rather for four of my stamp friends.</blockquote></blockquote><p>Maude Carey could be forthright in her opinions. She thought little of the first pictorial definitives issued in September 1929 but in early 1932 as acting postmaster she served as a member of the committee formed to plan the coming Centenary celebrations. It was she who proposed a new issue of stamps, which was taken up by a sub-committee chaired by George <a href=\"/biographies/roberts_george\">ROBERTS</a>. The Centenary commemorative set of 1933 is still widely admired and of all the stamps issued by the Falkland Islands Government is the best-known issue. Part of a Carey letter reproduced in Major Spafford's book <em>The 1933 Centenary Issue of the Falkland Islands </em>not only gives details of the second printings of the issue that arrived on the ocean liner <em>Reina del Pacifico </em>which is of great interest to specialists, but also refers to the reaction in Argentina:'I believe according to the paper 'La Prensa', [the Argentines] intend surcharging any of our letters which bear the Centenary stamps. They [have] got the impertinence to own the Islands. I've just written to someone there to see what will happen to my envelopes'. The majority of letters addressed to Argentina bearing this issue had their envelopes surcharged and are of particular interest to collectors.</p><p>Carey remained a spinster all her life. She was the first woman in the Islands to hold a driving licence. She retired owing to ill health on 22 September 1947, and died nearly three years later on 8 August 1950. She was awarded the ISO.</p>",

        "body": "<p>explorer, was born in London on 28 July 1913, the son of Adam Carse and Verena, née Mutter. He was educated at Sherborne and in Lausanne, before joining the  <em>Archibald Russell </em>as a square-rig apprentice. He served on the third commission of the Royal Research Ship  <em>Discovery II  </em>as an AB, <em> </em>leaving England late in 1933. The ship was engaged in oceanographic work in the Southern Ocean as part of the 'Discovery' Investigations under the Colonial Office.</p><p>In November 1934  <em>Discovery II  </em>was in harbour at Port Stanley when the Research Yacht  <em>Penola  </em>of the British Graham Land Expedition arrived, outward bound from England. On hearing that the captain expected to be short-handed after landing an Antarctic shore party, the commander of  <em>Discovery II  </em>allowed Carse to transfer to the expedition; he was its youngest member. During the first winter,  <em>Penola  </em>remained in the ice near the expedition base at the Argentine Islands off the west coast of Graham Land. Carse's main job was as deckhand and wireless operator (Morse), but he also took part in depot-1aying journeys to the mainland. In March 1936 the ship returned to Port Stanley, whence she sailed to South Georgia to undergo a refit. She then returned to the Antarctic, and in March 1937 picked up the shore party from its second-winter base in Marguerite Bay. It was not until August that  <em>Penola  </em>finally docked at Portsmouth.</p><p>The outbreak of war in 1939 found Carse working for the BBC as a pre­senter, overseas newsreader and programme announcer; but in 1942 he joined the Royal Navy as an ordi­nary seaman, passing out top of his cadet training course at Lancing. In fact, there was nothing ordinary about him, for on his jumper he wore the white ribbon of the Polar Medal, gazetted in 1939 for his service on the British Graham Land Expedition. He would recall that the ribbon invariably attracted the attention of inspecting officers who would say: 'Just the man we need for Russian convoys'. In the event, on being commissioned as a sub-lieutenant RNVR in 1943, Carse was sent to a trawler in the Western Approaches where he languished for the rest of the war.</p><p>After the war, in 1947, Carse embarked in the Swedish tall ship  <em>Passat </em>for her final voyage to Cape Town and during the voyage produced the film  <em>Proud Canvas </em>for the Maritime Museum. In 1949, Carse returned to the BBC as a radio presenter and actor and took over the character of Dick Barton, Special Agent, after 600 people had applied for the job. It was not lucrative work and before the series finished (in 1951 it gave way for  <em>The Archers),  </em>Carse departed in order to prepare for his South Georgia Survey. In four southern summers, between 1951 and 1957, he organised and led the South Georgia Survey. This was a formidable enterprise requiring dogged determination and the abil­ity to traverse mountainous, cre­vassed and mostly untrodden terrain in weather which was fre­quently atrocious. Not himself a qualified topographic surveyor, Carse recruited well-qualified men for all the work. The survey produced the first proper map of the whole of South Georgia, published by the Directorate of Overseas Surveys in 1958 at the scale of 1:200,000. It remains the standard map of the island and, during the 1982 conflict on South Geor­gia, it was an essential aid to land, sea and air operations.</p><p>Carse paid two further visits to South Georgia and was lucky to come back alive. In 1961 'as a per­sonal psychological experiment', he lived alone from February to Sep­tember (the entire southern winter) at Undine South Harbour on the hostile west coast of the Island. In May his hut was destroyed, and many of his stores were swept away by a surge wave. He managed to survive until rescued by the sealing vessel  <em>Petrel,  </em>and later made a tele­vision documentary film of his experience.</p><p>Then, in December 1973, Carse was landed from HMS  <em>Endurance  </em>at King Haakon Bay, on the west coast of South Georgia. His aim was to retrace Sir Ernest <a href=\"/biographies/shackleton_sir\">SHACKLETON</a>'s famous march in 1916 across the island to Stromness Bay, on the east coast. Carse was defeated by a severe and lengthy blizzard, which caught him high on the glacier; and two weeks later he was forced to struggle back to King Haakon Bay, where he was picked up by RRS  <em>John Biscoe.  </em>Carse idolised Shackleton, and to some extent saw himself as an explorer in the same mould. And Carse had this in common with the explorers of that age: an acute sense of territory. He regarded South Georgia as his personal estate and those planning private expedi­tions to the Island were well advised to seek his good will and learn from his considerable knowledge.</p><p>It was his great disappointment that he failed to win support for his proposal to produce and act the part of Shackleton in a documentary film reconstructing the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition of 1914-1917. In 1978 Carse took part in the Tall Ships' Race. He continued to work as a pre­senter until the mid-1980s; he also worked on the production side for the BBC, participating in series such as  <em>Horizon, The Countryman  </em>and  <em>Travellers in Time.  </em>He revisited his old Antarctic haunts to make a documentary about the work of the British Antarctic Survey. After the Falklands War of 1982, he was commissioned to prepare the Army Expedition Guide to South Georgia.</p><p>Latterly, however, he became increasingly disillusioned with life, feeling that his talents had never been fully appreciated. His personal affairs had also been complicated: there were early marital failures, which led to financial problems. However, in 1959 he met Venetia Soames whom he married in 1962. They spent 42 years together and, in marriage, he was able finally to find contentment. In 1992 his morale was greatly boosted when he was awarded a second clasp to his Polar Medal for his work in mapping South Georgia. The unusually long delay in recognition was partly due to the fact that, until 1976, service on South Georgia was not considered eligible for the award of the Polar Medal.</p><p>Carse was also honoured in the naming of Carse Point, on the east coast of George VI Sound, Antarctic Peninsula, and of Mount Carse, a 2,300 m peak in the southern part of South Georgia. To his regret, Carse never found the opportunity to make the first ascent of his mountain, an achievement left for Stephen Vena­bles in 1990.</p><p>He was married three times: to Sylvia Hatfield in 1939 - they had two daughters Deidre (b1941) and Elizabeth (b1945 to Lisa Wilen in 1950 - they had one son Peter (b1950 and to Venetia Soames in 1962 - she died on 29 September 2006.</p><p>Carse did not seek the limelight. To those who knew him best, he was a man of great integrity, as well as a loyal, amusing but very tough-­minded friend and expedition com­panion, whose endurance in the field few could match. But Carse would have wished to be remembered principally for his work in mapping the island of South Georgia.</p>",

        "body": " <p>mariner, missing person. There are a few individuals whose names are well known in Falklands lore simply due to the fate that befell them, rather than because of anything achieved during their lifetimes. One such is Ned Casey, about whom virtually nothing is known, other than that he disappeared in Camp and that his remains were not discovered until twenty three years later.</p><p>In the <em>Falkland Islands Magazine </em>of October 1890 the following report appeared:</p><blockquote><blockquote>Ned Casey, late of the 'Foam', crossed from Saunders Island to the West Falklands at night for the doctor several weeks ago. He has never been seen since. The boat was found drawn up above high water mark. It is supposed that he must have fallen over the cliffs in the darkness.</blockquote></blockquote><p>There were no further developments in the story until December 1913, when the manager of Hill Cove, Sydney Miller senior, wrote to the colonial secretary, John Quayle <a href=\"/biographies/dickson_john\">DICKSON</a> as follows:</p><blockquote><blockquote>Sir,</blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>When the shepherds were gathering the Mountains on this Station last Sunday November 30th one of the men found a skeleton of a man, all he could see was part of a pair of boots, part of one legging and an old sheath knife. It is supposed to be the remains of a man named 'Casey' lost about 24 years ago, who was working on Saunders Island and came over to the Main Island. Your Chief Constable [William Atkins] could give you full details of the case, as he was then living at Shallow Bay and helped form a search party for the body.</blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>I am, Sir, etc.</blockquote></blockquote><p>A full report appeared in the <em>Falkland Islands Magazine and Church Paper </em>for January 1914 under the headline 'Grim Discovery at Hill Cove':</p><blockquote><blockquote>On Nov 30th, after 23 years, the remains of the late Ned (or Edward) Casey have been found near Hill Cove. Far away on the highest peak standing on the West Side of Darry Valley, the mountains have at last given up their grim secret. It chanced that Mr. E. Johnson was out gathering sheep in this part, when he found the remains. Apparently the ill-fated man, hungry and footsore, and thoroughly tired out, had at last given up hope and so lay down to sleep his last sleep in this out of the way place, miles from any help or assistance. This theory seems to have been borne out from the position of the remains, which were found lying face downwards, the arms folded underneath. All that remained of the clothing was a piece of Cardigan jacket and some of the trousers: the boots and leggings were also there, but the elements had caused all the stitching to rot away. By his side lay a sheath knife, bearing the initials of Donald McInnes (late of Roy Cove). The brief history of the tragedy is as follows: - About the end of June 1890, Ned Casey was sent across Reef Channel from Saunders Island in a dinghy to summon the doctor for a man who was taken ill on the Island. The Schooner 'Hornet' was at the time lying wind-bound in the Channel and on his way across he boarded her: this was the last occasion on which he was seen alive. He landed at Shallow Bay late in the afternoon and a dense fog came on. Even though the distance from the water to the house is only 20 minutes walk, yet he lost his way, and we can only imagine what his feelings must have been as he walked aimlessly mile after mile until he reached that lonely spot where his body was found. Some days later another man was sent from Saunders to hurry the Doctor, and then it was discovered that Casey had not been seen or heard of. The dinghy was found hauled up on the beach with the unfortunate man's coat rolled up in her, which proved he had little with him to afford warmth or protection. Mr Miller kindly lent horses and men and together with a party from Saunders Island a thorough search was made in all directions for over a week, till at length all hope was abandoned of his ever being found. And so at length, after 23 long years, the terrible tragedy has come to light.</blockquote></blockquote><p>The report is signed JF Summers (John Falkland Summers, who was the Cathedral sexton for many years, thus well-placed to write for the <em>Church Magazine </em>).</p><p>Nothing more is known about Ned Casey. His name does not feature in any of the official registers and although there are records of one or two other individuals named Casey, there is no evidence to connect them with Ned. He appears to have had no family or established home in the Falklands. His story exemplifies two aspects of local history. Like Ned, there were many who lost their way in Camp. The lack of roads, or even clear tracks or easily distinguished landmarks, the long distances between settlements, the unpredictable weather, made travelling hazardous for anyone unfamiliar with the terrain. Some were found after extended periods of wandering, some like Ned died before they reached help, only for their remains to be discovered later and a few simply vanished without further trace. Ned Casey also typifies another aspect of Falklands history: the numbers of tough, enterprising, adventurous men, usually mariners, who found themselves far from home in the unforgiving surroundings of the South Atlantic. They made lives for themselves here. Some like poor Ned Casey lost the battle with the environment. Many, however, survived and flourished, established homes and families and are the ancestors of numerous Islanders today.</p>",

His father died during World War I and both brothers were brought up by their mother. He was educated at Hastings Grammar School and after school trained as a teacher in Winchester and began his working life in London. World War II then intervened. Cawkell joined the army and was posted to the Middle East. While working at General Spears' mission in Syria he met his wife Mary Waddell (Mary <a href=\"/biographies/cawkell_mary\">CAWKELL)</a> and they were married in Lebanon in October 1942. After the mission was disbanded he took over the Middle East Biological Scheme organising expeditions for army personnel and sending back valuable specimens to the British Museum. He had risen rapidly from second lieutenant to acting lieutenant-colonel.</p><p>Back in England he became headmaster at Mere in Wiltshire and Swanage in Dorset, before sailing for the Falkland Islands and a Colonial Service post as the colony's education officer. The appointment was confirmed in August 1950. It was an appointment that he had particularly wanted, both for the challenge of the job, and also because of his lifelong interest in ornithology.</p><p>During his six years there he brought about radical changes and contributed tremendously to the development of education in the Falklands by his vigour and energy. Teaching staff were strengthened. He oversaw the building of a boarding school in Darwin which was funded by the Falkland Islands Company to celebrate their centenary in 1951. At that time, the early 1950s, education was compulsory between the ages of 5 and 14 with voluntary classes enabling study to be continued to the age of sixteen. Cawkell arranged for scholarship children to go to England to complete their education. He was also responsible for the opening of Stanley's infant school in 1956. A keen horseman, he visited all areas of the islands overseeing the three travelling teachers who, together with radio lessons, provided the education for Camp children. Travelling on horseback also enabled him to make observations on the bird life of the Islands, which resulted in an authoritative checklist.</p><p>In 1950 he was appointed by Governor <a href=\"/biographies/clifford_sir\">CLIFFORD</a> to LegCo and in 1951 he was also appointed a member of ExCo. In April 1955 he was appointed director of broadcasting in the Falklands and chairman of the Broadcasting Advisory Committee. So in addition to running the schools, having a full teaching load, being involved with the new schools being built in Stanley and Darwin and work connected with the Central Film Library, organising visits of visiting scientists, he took on being responsible for broadcasting. At home the garden was always full of penguins, generally en route for zoos in other parts of the world.</p><p>He left the Falklands after being appointed to the Gambia as the director of education. When that colony gained independence he returned to the UK and joined the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA) as director of safety education. By then he had married his second wife Rosemary Joy Bartlett. They retired to Rye in East Sussex and became involved in local and church affairs. Joy Cawkell died in 1985, and Edwin Cawkell on 24 September 1997.</p>",

She was educated locally, but rejected university, something she later regretted. Her parents' marriage ended while she was in her twenties, and she, with her mother and sister Cathy, made the big, and unusual, step of moving first to South Africa and then Southern Rhodesia {Zimbabwe}. She worked as a secretary and enjoyed life in Africa, panning for gold and travelling extensively. Later she wrote a novel based on this time of her life. When war broke out she travelled to the Middle East to work in General Spears' political and military mission in Syria and Lebanon. It was there that she met and married her husband Edwin <a href=\"/biographies/cawkell_edwin\">CAWKELL</a> in October 1942. Because of army regulations she had to leave the Middle East when she became pregnant. Her only child, a daughter, Rowan, was born in June 1943 after Mary had returned to Rhodesia. Later she joined her husband in England, before sailing for the Falklands in 1950 when her husband was appointed superintendent of education.</p><p>She was appointed honorary secretary of the Broadcasting Committee and in researching her radio talks, under the title of  <em>From Then Until Now </em>, she became particularly interested in the complex and controversial story of the Islands with its turbulent years of disputed sovereignty. Her first book, entitled simply  <em>The Falkland Islands,  </em>was published by Macmillan in 1960. A chapter on the birdlife was added by her husband with Dr Derek Maling contributing chapters on the climate, vegetation and geological structure of the Islands. The book immediately became the standard modern history, replacing VE <a href=\"/biographies/boyson_violet\">BOYSON</a>'s book of the same title written in 1924.</p><p>When the Argentine invasion and subsequent war came in 1982 she was commissioned to write  <em>The Falkland Story 1592-1982 </em>, a shorter general history of the Falklands of much use to those journalists who had difficulty in placing the Islands.</p><p>Her third book <em>The History of the Falkland Islands </em>was published by Anthony Nelson in 2001, sadly after her death. This is the standard complete history of the Falklands and produces a compelling story of the Islands through the various attempts at colonisation and disputed possession to the establishment of the British settlement at Stanley in 1845. Subsequent development of the Islands is explored with the evolution of farming, the establishment of schools and other services, through increasing tension and invasion, bringing the story up to the end of the twentieth century.</p><p>While living in Stanley Mary Cawkell wrote many articles, humorous and practical, for publication in British magazines, newspapers and collections, shedding light on life as lived in the Falklands - from having a menu of 365 [mutton] to life with a pet king penguin.</p><p>She moved to the Gambia in 1956 after her husband was appointed director of education there. Their marriage was dissolved in 1961 and Mary Cawkell lived in Norfolk for a number of years before moving to London and thence to East Sussex. She continued with her journalism and travelled extensively, generally to countries less visited in those days. She became a Buddhist. Later in life she worked almost exclusively on her Falklands history and, retaining her abiding affection, took a great interest in developing events in the Islands. She died in East Sussex on 8 January 2001.</p>",

        "body": "<p>baron and visiting minister, was born on 5 December 1919, the son of Arthur Gwynne Jones and Eliza Alice, née Hardman, and educated at West Monmouth School. He was commissioned into the South Wales Borderers in 1940 and served in Burma and, after World War II, in Malaya, where he was awarded the MC in 1957 and in Cyprus. In 1948 he married Dr Mona Mitchell. From 1961-1964 he was defence correspondent of the London <em>Times. </em>In 1964 the new Labour government appointed him Minister of State at the Foreign Office and elevated him to the peerage as Baron Chalfont. He was also appointed Privy Councillor. In 1966 Chalfont was made minister responsible for British European policy.</p><p>In 1968 Chalfont accompanied the Queen and the Duke of <a href=\"/biographies/edinburgh_the\">EDINBURGH</a> on state visits to Brazil and Chile, and as the royal party began their return journey, the Foreign Office announced that he would visit the Falkland Islands - the first visit by a British Minister. Accompanied by Sir Arthur Galsworthy, the senior official responsible for dependant territories, Chalfont sailed from Montevideo in HMS <em>Endurance </em>on 19 November, arriving in Port Howard on 23 November, where he was greeted by Islanders in what he assumed was a traditional welcome - only to see that their placards read 'Chalfont go home!' Despite this, the Islanders were unfailingly courteous and Chalfont met about sixty people in the village hall. He sensed that the profusion of Union Jacks was more than an expression of imperial nostalgia. The Islanders clearly felt a deep insecurity about the future.</p><p>Chalfont's task was not merely to emphasise to Islanders that there could be no change in sovereignty against their wishes. He also hoped to convince them that maintaining the status quo was not in their real interests; permanent isolation from Argentina and a refusal even to negotiate was damaging to their own economic interests and could be dangerous in the longer term. Britain was no longer the great imperial power, but if the Islanders could bring themselves to face the future realistically they could rely on the British government to defend their rights and allay their fears about closer ties with Argentina.</p><p>A series of meetings was held in Stanley, with bodies ranging from ExCo to the Sheep Owners' Association. Chalfont set out the 'agreed position', which was within sight after 18 months of negotiation with the Argentine government. This would provide for practical steps to improve communications which both governments hoped would lead to a wider rapprochement, while the sovereignty issue was left on the side. While many members of ExCo were opposed to any change, after a further day of talks, a majority accepted the London position. Chalfont made a broadcast to Islanders, repeating that no change in sovereignty could take place without their agreement, ultimately safeguarded by parliament.</p><p>The party sailed for Buenos Aires, where they arrived on 1 December with no optimism for the future of the Islands and a strong sense that they were a bizarre anachronism. Talks with the Argentine foreign minister Nicanor Costa Mendez did little to brighten the mood. Argentina continued to take a very hard line on sovereignty and refused to accept the primacy of the Islanders' wishes and the principle of self-determination. On his return to London, Chalfont faced ritual accusations of 'betrayal' from certain sections of the press and the Conservative opposition. In retrospect, he believes that the crisis in 1982 could have been avoided if the British government had been more flexible with Argentina and if governments had not simply handed control of policy to the Islanders. Writing in 2000, Chalfont maintained that 'the position of the islanders is politically and economically untenable in the long term. It is as clear today as it was when I left the Foreign Office in 1970, that some accommodation with Argentina will one day be necessary'.</p><p>After leaving government in 1970, Chalfont concentrated on his business interests, becoming a director of IBM United Kingdom, and of Lazard Brothers, the merchant bankers. He was chairman of Vickers Shipbuilding during the construction of Britain's Trident fleet. His visits to South America cemented his lasting interest in the region and from 1975 to 1980 he was president of the Hispanic and Luso-Brazilian Councils at Canning House. He has written several books on defence topics and a memoir <em>The Shadow of my Hand  </em>in 2000. He was awarded the OBE in 1961.</p><p>Chalfont's visit in 1968 was the first occasion on which it became clear to people in the Islands that the old colonial status quo was ending and that they and the British government no longer saw their future in the same way.</p>",

After a poor academic record at school and a short time working for a national bank, he was conscripted for national service in 1958, serving in East Africa and the Mediterranean when the 'wanderlust' took hold.

Within a month of arriving in Stanley they welcomed into their home the Revd Dr Arnoldo Canclini, visiting from Buenos Aires, a senior Baptist minister and world authority on Christian Missions in Patagonia; he was to become a lifelong friend.</p><p>Together with a strong band of workers from the church, the emphasis of the Charmans' ministry in Stanley included working amongst children and young people; the numbers attending the Curiosity Club, Town Hall 'twist sessions', youth home groups, and Sunday School proved a need for such work amongst the younger generation. Charman was involved in the Winter Show, the popular wool and handicrafts exhibition introduced by Lady Haskard; he also taught religious studies in Stanley schools. He occasionally found himself in hot water when challenging the established order of things - full representative democracy was only a glint in a few people's eyes in those days.</p><p>The joy of regularly visiting Camp families proved to be an important aspect of Charman's work; the MV  <em>Forrest </em>, which he dedicated, together with RMS  <em>Darwin </em>, the Beaver floatplanes and even the odd horse are remembered as enjoyable means of transport.</p><p>The Charmans arrived in Stanley with two daughters, Ruth (b1963) and Elizabeth (b1966), and left with an additional child, Stephen (b1970).</p><p>The stresses of Christian ministry in the Islands, with the inability to 'get away' from the work, took its toll and Charman did not return to Christian ministry for many years after returning to London in April 1971. However, the experience of church work in the Islands significantly changed his life: his beliefs and practices became more flexible and open and the experience of human nature that he gained in the Islands enriched his life and influenced his future work.</p><p>Since his time in the Falklands, Charman's work has included establishing a race relations project in the east end of London. He returned to education while in his 50s and gained a doctorate from Lancaster University (he always felt a bit inferior to his predecessor in 'the Tab'!). He returned to Christian ministry in an east London church in 1998 before retiring in 2004.</p><p>In 1982 he helped to establish the Penguin Project which successfully raised funds to enable him to return to the Islands immediately after the Conflict in order to minister to members of the Tabernacle who then were without a minister. <em> </em>At the invitation of the Tabernacle, the Charmans visited the Islands in 1992 for their centenary celebrations in Stanley and Goose Green. They also returned for a holiday in 2006, together with their friend Arnoldo Canclini.</p><p>For much of their married life Diane Charman taught in primary schools, mainly in London, as well as taking a full and important role in church life. They now spend their retirement in London where they enjoy life with their adult children and grandchildren in a multiethnic community. Their son Stephen is the Methodist chaplain at Lancaster University.</p>",

At the age of eight, owing to an accident, he lost an arm, yet, in spite of this handicap, he learnt to perform all the duties of a shepherd with great efficiency, as well as being skilful at domestic chores such as cutting peat, wheeling a barrow and carrying a baby on horseback.</p><p>For most of his life he worked at Hill Cove, where, according to a contemporary tribute 'his sterling worth and loyalty were highly appreciated'. Here he met his wife, Minnie Tullett, who was originally from England.

Mr.Cheek was a remarkable man'. It goes on to say: 'In his last illness Mr Cheek displayed an admirable cheerfulness of spirit. He was grateful for the many acts of kindness bestowed by numerous friends, but of his own suffering he had little or nothing to say. He was only concerned lest his relatives should worry'.

        "body": "<p>councillor, was born at Hill Cove, West Falkland on 16 May 1911. His father John Cheek was also born in the Islands but his mother Minnie Cheek, née Tullet, came from near Brighton (Sussex) to work as a maid for the farm manager at Hill Cove. Following the death of his father, his mother, who continued to work in Camp, sent young Fred to Stanley so that he could attend school. After school he worked briefly at Teal Inlet, East Falkland before returning to Hill Cove where he was employed as a shepherd. He was always proud that he was among those who could shear two hundred or more sheep a day - those were the days of hand shears and just a basic wage of about six pounds a month.</p><p>In 1937 Cheek married Dorothy Johnson at Hill Cove. In 1946 they moved to Stanley so that their two sons, John (1939-1996) and Gerald (b1941), could have a better education than was available in Camp in those days. Following a couple of years working as a general hand in the Agricultural Department he started work with the Falkland Islands Company and he continued with them until his retirement. For most of this time he was employed as a handyman. He also undertook a number of contracts for the FIC which included building a bunkhouse at Goose Green in 1964, following the disastrous fire in the former building during the Darwin Sports meeting in February of that year. Other building contracts included the woolshed at Port Stephens, the wool storage warehouse on the FIC jetty and the hovercraft hangar at the Royal Marines base at Moody Brook. Prior to this he spent a number of summer seasons with Ernie Barnes; between them they constructed many miles of fencing in the Walker Creek and Goose Green areas. During the fence-building contracts which involved working a minimum of twelve hours every day, their accommodation was a small caravan built on sledge runners and towed by an ex-World War II Bren gun carrier*. Cheek's later years were spent maintaining the Royal Marines base at Moody Brook. He retired on 1 April 1982, and during the afternoon as he collected his tools was puzzled by the frantic activity of the Marines.</p><p>Cheek joined the General Employees Union shortly after its inception in the early nineteen forties. He became a member of the Union's executive committee and was elected chairman for a number of years. His involvement with the Union led to him being asked to stand for LegCo. He was duly elected and served for Stanley from 1964 for three years. He did not stand again as he was not prepared, as he put it, 'to act as a rubber stamp' for decisions made by a majority official and nominated Council.</p><p>Cheek was always deeply interested in the Falklands' wildlife; his knowledge of the subject following a lifetime of observation was fascinating to listen to. It was particularly pleasing that it was during his time on Council that the area around Stanley, from Moody Brook to Cape Pembroke was declared a non-shooting area. We can now see the result of this action with birds such as the Upland Geese re-appearing and breeding in the area. Indeed it is quite common these days to see such birds feeding on grassed areas right in the middle of Stanley. Cheek spent the years following his retirement quietly in Stanley with more time to enjoy both his love of gardening and trout fishing. He was widowed in 1984 and died on 14 August 1994.</p><p><a href=\"/biographies/arrowsmith_sir\">See Image 12</a></p>",

        "body": "<p>lawyer and Falklands campaigner, was born in Downe (Kent) on 18 August 1922, the eldest of three sons of Harold Alfred Hunter Christie, QC, TD and his wife Norah Agnes Veronica, née Brooks. He was the grandson of Sir William Christie, Astronomer Royal and great-grandson of Professor Samuel Hunter Christie, Secretary of the Royal Society. He was educated at Marlborough. After winning a place at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, he volunteered for the Young Soldiers Battalion of the Royal Berkshire Regiment in 1940 from which he was posted to Sandhurst; commissioned into the Coldstream Guards in 1941, seriously wounded in 1943 and invalided out in 1944. He then joined the South American Department of the Foreign Office, and was appointed third secretary to the British Embassy, Buenos Aires 1946-1948.</p><p>His period in the Foreign Office first brought to his attention the Argentine claim to the Falkland Islands. While serving at the Embassy in Buenos Aires it was his task to master the past history of the Islands, and of the Falkland Islands Dependencies, in order to answer the claims which were then being forwarded by the Argentine Government. At one official function he talked to President <a href=\"/biographies/peron_juan\">PERON</a>, who stated quite openly that he intended to resurrect the Argentine claims, as a means of gaining political support. It was also on one occasion his duty to dance with Eva Peron, which he described as 'like dancing with a tigress on heat'. Christie returned from Argentina in 1948 to read for the Bar. Dr Brian <a href=\"/biographies/roberts_brian\">ROBERTS</a>, Senior Research Fellow at the Scott Polar Research Institute, suggested to him that he should research and write a history of the Falkland Islands to counter Argentina's claim. Christie had been much concerned by this claim, and consequently spent 1948 and most of 1949 at the SPRI writing <em>The Antarctic Problem,</em>which was published in 1951 by Allen &amp; Unwin.</p><p>On 20 May 1950 he married Merle, elder daughter of Roderick and Dorothea MacLeod, at Lincoln's Inn. They had four children: Robert (b1951), Fiona (b1955), Niall (b1960) and Catriona (b1968). He was called to the Bar at Lincoln's Inn in 1952, became Head of Chambers in 1979, and a Bencher in 1989. He had a busy general Chancery practice, specialising in the petroleum industry, charity law, EEC law, and the rights of highways &amp; inland waterways. In 1948 Christie had bought a canal boat hull, and he and his wife converted it into a houseboat, spending all holidays for the next five years exploring what still survived of the canal system. In 1950 he became a Council member of the Inland Waterways Association, and spent a considerable time lobbying on behalf of the restitution and maintenance of canals, with particular reference to amending the Transport Act of 1962. He undoubtedly acquired and honed his knowledge of Parliamentary lobbying at this time. He was a member of Chelsea Borough Council from 1956 to 1965, and was involved with several local charities in Chelsea. Christie was elected to the Court of the Worshipful Company of Clockmakers in 1968, and was Master in 1979. He had grown up in the country with an abiding interest in natural history, farming and country sports. His leisure time for forty years was spent at the family cottage in Sussex, where he could pursue his interest in forestry.</p><p>Following his four years in the diplomatic service, Christie took a continuing interest in the future of the Falkland Islands, and from 1968 devoted ever-increasing time to this. The resultant political lobby was described by the historian Michael Charlton as 'a totally uncompromising lobby' and 'one of the most influential lobbies in modern British politics'.</p><p>He played a prominent part in forming the Falkland Islands Emergency Committee in 1968, which followed a direct appeal for help made to members of the House of Commons by Falkland Islands Councillors. He was joint honorary secretary from 1972, and strongly supported all-party representation on the Committee. The Committee was re-formed in July 1972 at the request of Falkland Islanders, and re-designated the United Kingdom Falkland Islands Committee. A Falkland Islands Committee was also formed in Stanley in the same year, which kept in close contact with the UKFIC. In 1973 the UKFIC adopted as its objective:</p><blockquote><blockquote>To assist the people of the Falkland Islands to decide their own future for themselves without being subject to pressure direct or indirect from any quarter.</blockquote></blockquote><p>In 1974 Christie initiated the first annual Falkland Islands Reception in Lincoln's Inn, at which Earl Mountbatten of Burma was guest of honour. This was attended by Members of both Houses of Parliament from all political parties, representatives of the media, potential supporters, and Falkland Islanders resident in the UK. Thereafter this function became an annual event, and since 1983 has been organised by the Falkland Islands Government Office. He also inaugurated the annual wreath laying ceremony at the Cenotaph in December, to commemorate the Battle of the Falklands (1914), the Battle of the River Plate (1939) and since 1982 the Falklands Conflict.</p><p>In 1975 Christie spent three weeks in the Falkland Islands. He held 11 formal meetings in Stanley, including a public one with 220 people present, and public meetings for the inhabitants of 12 settlements in Camp. He made 34 calls in Stanley involving interviews and exchanges of view. He concluded that the people of the Islands were adamant in their desire to remain British and that strong indirect pressure had been put on the people of this small community to change their allegiance against their will. In 1975 and 1976 Christie strongly supported Lord SHACKLETON's Economic Survey of the Falklands Islands, and assisted in briefing Lord Shackleton and his team.</p><p>In 1976 he formed the Falkland Islands Association (originally called the Falkland Islands Research &amp; Development Association), in order to provide an office and secretariat for the UKFIC in London, and to bring together all those interested in the future of the Islands. He was Chairman from 1976 to 1983. Known as 'The Falkland Islands Office', this provided a focal point for Falklands information and affairs during the ten week Falklands Conflict in 1982, and provided a headquarters for the two Councillors in London at the time (one having been deported from the Falklands by Argentina).</p><p>It was during this period that Dr. Nicanor Costa Mendes, Argentine Minister for External Relations l966-69 and 1981-82, referred to Christie as 'another devilish lawyer' which greatly entertained him. In 1978 the Association formed the South Atlantic Fisheries Committee, of which he was also chairman. This Committee campaigned continuously for a fishing zone round the Falkland Islands, which was eventually declared by the British Government in 1986. The ensuing productive fishing included large quantities of squid, and Christie used occasionally to refer to a letter received by the Committee before the imposition of the zone, signed by a minister of state, containing the sentence 'my expert advisers tell me there are no squid in the seas around the Falklands'.</p><p>In 1981 the Association established the United Kingdom Falkland Islands Trust, a registered charity which provides grants for educational and agricultural objectives. The Association also took an active part in the formation of the Falklands Foundation, a registered charity now known as Falklands Conservation. Christie was invited by the Falkland Islands Government to attend the Heritage Year celebrations in 1992 and spent two weeks in the Islands; travelled extensively there, and was much impressed by recent developments. He had a major heart attack later that summer, and thereafter was not allowed to fly. He was awarded the Freedom of Stanley in 1994, and regarded this as the greatest honour he could receive.</p><p>He retired from a long and successful career at the chancery bar in February 1997, and died of cancer and heart failure on 21 September 1997. A memorial service was held in Christ Church Cathedral, Stanley, simultaneously with the memorial service held in the chapel of Lincoln's Inn, on 25 November 1997. In the eulogy in Stanley, Councillor Mike Summers said:</p><blockquote><blockquote>Bill probably achieved more for the people of the Falklands than any other individual...and he never told us what to think or what to do, but he believed passionately in our right to determine that for ourselves. He would never accept that others had the right to make that decision.</blockquote></blockquote><p>In March 1998 a memorial book signed by over 500 Falkland Islanders was presented by the Falkland Islands Committee in Stanley to Christie's widow.</p>",

Clagg was raised in Honolulu, Hawaii, where the family moved after World War II. He studied biology at the University of Hawaii.</p><p>In September 1962, Clagg (an entomology technician with the Bernice P Bishop Museum of Honolulu, Hawaii) arrived in London, to join Lance <a href=\"/biographies/tickell_william\">TICKELL</a> and Ron Pinder (BAS ornithologists) to complete preparations for the 1962-1964 British Antarctic Survey/United States Antarctic Research Program joint expedition to Bird Island, South Georgia. The party of three left England on the RRS <em>Shackleton </em>in early October, arriving in Stanley in November 1962. There Clagg delivered entomology supplies to Ian Strange who had been making insect collections in the Falklands in collaboration with the Bishop Museum's Entomology Department chairman, Dr J Lindsey Gressitt. The <em>Shackleton </em>arrived at Bird Island, South Georgia in early December 1962 after a stop at King Edward Point (KEP) to pick up Bill Vaughn, the sealing biologist, who was to conduct southern fur seal studies for a few months on Bird Island.</p><p>Clagg made extensive collections of insects and other terrestrial arthropods on Bird Island during the first year, December 1962 to November 1963. These collections were extended to several other locations on the main island of South Georgia during the following summer season from November 1963 to April 1964. These locations included the peninsula with KEP and Grytviken whaling station, the peninsulas adjacent to Husvik and Leith Harbour whaling stations, the Barff Peninsula, and the environs of Moltke Harbour.</p><p>While on Bird Island, Clagg also assisted Tickell and Pinder with their bird banding studies, Vaughn with his fur seal studies, and conducted his own independent leopard seal study during the winter season. Of course, the whole team worked together to construct the three additional buildings at the Fresh Water Bay Base Camp adjacent to 'Bonner's Bothey', the first permanent structure on Bird Island built by biologist Nigel <a href=\"/biographies/bonner_william\">BONNER</a> in the 1950s.</p><p>In the 1970 <em>Pacific Insects Monograph 23 </em>, Dr J Lindsey Gressitt had counted a total of 149 terrestrial arthropods documented from South Georgia collections by Clagg and others. Of these, 41 were Free-living Insecta, 55 were Free-living other arthropods and 53 were Parasitic Acarina and Insecta .</p><p>After his work in South Georgia, Clagg served four years in the US Coast Guard and finished his formal education obtaining a bachelor's degree in Forest Management Science in 1974 and a master's in Fire Ecology in 1975, both at Colorado State University. He then pursued a career in forestry and wildfire management with the US National Forest Service. Clagg married Dorothy Ann Herrmann of Peru, Illinois, on 25 October 1969. The Claggs are now both retired and live in Prineville, Oregon. They have no children. Both are Christians.</p>",

After successive promotions he was promoted to <em>capitán de fragata </em>on 29 October 1781. On 15 September 1782 he was appointed in command of the corvette <em>Santa Elena </em>, sailing in her from Cádiz to Río de la Plata in company with the store-ship <em>Anunciación </em>.</p><p>He remained in the station until 1 March 1791, and served three times as <em>comandante gobernador </em>of the Spanish settlement at Puerto de la Soledad (Port Louis) in the <em>Santa Elena </em>, first taking over from Augustín FIGUEROA on 15 May 1785 and staying in post until 25 May 1786,when he was relieved by Pedro de <a href=\"/biographies/mesa_castro\">MESA</a>. On 15 May 1787 he took over again from Mesa as governor, serving until 10 April 1788, when he was relieved once again by Mesa. On 29 March 1787 he submitted a manifest in which he stated that the establishment, including the crew of the <em>Santa Elena </em>, consisted of nine officers, 24 soldiers forming the garrison, 88 seamen and 25 convicts. The livestock comprised 2001 cattle, 109 horses and 108 geese. Clairac returned to Puerto de la Soledad for the third time on 16 May 1789, when he took over from Mesa once again, serving until 30 June 1790 when he was relieved by Juan José <a href=\"/biographies/elizalde_y\">ELIZALDE</a>. During his time in the Islands he produced a chart of the entire archipelago by sea and land, carrying the necessary horses on board his ship. When he took over as governor in 1785 the settlement had consisted of 34 buildings and its population was under 100, including the garrison. The settlement was also protected by batteries which had been established earlier, two of which he repaired. Livestock of all kinds numbered 7,774 head. Communication between Puerto de la Soledad, Puerto Deseado on the coast and Montevideo was kept up by six warships with orders to protect the Islands from all attacks.</p><p>On 19 March 1789 Clairac was ordered to reconnoitre the coast of Patagonia and to visit the ports of San Julián, Santa Cruz and Puerto Deseado to discover whether the British had any establishments there or were employed in the fisheries in those waters; in which case he was instructed to evict them, always showing the greatest civility and urbanity. This he did with the frigate and brig he found at Puerto Deseado, providing them with victuals and provisions from his own stores. In a report to the viceroy Clairac named seven British and one American vessels in Port Egmont, between 1787-90, engaged in whaling and sealing, stating that their business was very profitable. In consequence he showed himself very keen to develop the resources of the Islands and to contradict the idea that the Islands were a sterile possession and their inhabitants of no use to the Spanish crown. It was probably due to him that a fishing company was established by Spain in 1790, its principal factory being at Puerto Deseado, which was extended to the Falklands by royal decree of 15 September 1792. He relinquished command of the <em>Santa Elena </em>on 18 July 1791, having been promoted <em>capitán de navío  </em>on 4 October 1789<em>.  </em>His final seagoing appointment was in command of the ship <em>San Augustín </em>, in which he served until 28 February 1800.</p>",

He joined the navy as a captain's servant on board HMS <em>Cornwall </em>and, after serving in several other ships, passed for lieutenant on 7 January 1756. On 1 September 1772, at the age of 37, Clayton was appointed in command of the armed shallop <em>Penguin </em>, mounting ten swivels, and ordered to proceed to Port Egmont to take charge of the settlement there. The <em>Penguin </em>had been specially built at Woolwich and was placed in pieces on board the store-ship <em>Endeavour </em>, Lieutenant James Gordon, for passage to the Falklands. The <em>Endeavour </em>, formerly the command of Captain James <a href=\"/biographies/cook_james\">COOK</a>, sailed from the Nore on 1 December 1772, reaching Port Egmont on 28 February 1773, where the sloop <em>Hound, </em>Commander John Burr, was already at anchor. The following day Clayton landed and took over command of the British settlement there from Burr. The <em>Penguin </em>'s complement of 50, which formed the garrison of the settlement, consisted of a master's mate, two midshipmen, two surgeon's mates, 19 seaman, a lieutenant of marines and 23 marines. Clayton's first task was to reassemble the <em>Penguin </em>on shore and she was duly launched on 9 April. A week later the <em>Hound </em>and <em>Endeavour </em>sailed for England, leaving the little <em>Penguin </em>as the settlement's sole protection. The <em>Penguin </em>remained at anchor in the creek for a month, but for some unknown reason she was then hauled up on shore, where she remained until the <em>Endeavour </em>'s return.</p><p>Surgeon's mate Bernard Penrose published an account of the settlement on his return to England, giving an interesting sketch of life on the Islands and paying a generous tribute to Clayton's kindliness and tact, noting that each Sunday Clayton performed divine service. During the week the inhabitants explored the vicinity, hunting, fishing and maintaining the buildings and tending their thirty-eight gardens, about a mile from the settlement. Penrose recorded that on 6 November 1773 the tussock grass was accidentally set alight and before it was extinguished by a heavy downpour the fire had spread for twenty miles, killing hundreds of seals and penguins.</p><p>Meanwhile in London, the government had decided to abandon the settlement and the <em>Endeavour </em>was sent back to the Falklands to evacuate Port Egmont, anchoring off the settlement on 23 April 1774. The <em>Penguin </em>was then dismantled and all the settlement's stores were stowed on board the <em>Endeavour </em>. In a letter dated 20 May 1774, Clayton informed Philip Stephens at the Admiralty, that previous to embarking he caused a plate of lead with an inscription engraved on it to be set up on the door of the fort, asserting His Majesty's right to the Falkland Islands with all its dependencies, enclosing a copy of the inscription. He reported that he had left flying His Majesty's colours on the Fort and on the highest hill on the north entrance of the harbour. In the settlement he had left standing the fort, two stone-built storehouses, three stone-built dwelling houses, three sod-built dwelling houses, two piers of stone for boats to land at, one substantial stone wharf and a convenient basin and a crane for landing and loading heavy articles. In addition, there were in various spots several different enclosures and gardens in which plenty of vegetables had been raised. In an enclosure Clayton reported that in February 1774 the whalers <em>Montagu </em>and <em>Thomas </em>from Boston had entered Port Egmont and on 19 May the whaler <em>King George </em>from Rhode Island had also anchored off the settlement.</p><p>In the last entry in his log, dated 21 May 1774, Clayton recorded that at a half past noon he fixed the lead plate on the door of the fort, the Marines being drawn up under arms with fixed bayonets, with music being played and the drum being beaten. As <em>God save the King </em>was played, Clayton hoisted His Majesty's colours on the fort. At 3 pm, amidst cheers, Clayton and all the officers and ship's company of the <em>Penguin </em>embarked on board the <em>Endeavour </em>which then got under way and set sail for England, reaching Spithead on 19 September and anchoring off Woolwich ten days later.</p><p>On his return to England, Clayton wrote a description of the islands, which was published erroneously under the name William Clayton in 1776 by the Royal Society in its <em>Philosophical Transactions.  </em>It contained one of the earliest accounts of the natural history of Saunders Island, which he described as 'that barren, dreary, desolate, boggy, rocky spot'. His manuscript account of the flora of the island is held in the British Library. He brought back with him two or three shrubs, which he grew in his garden in Peckham, perhaps the first specimens of the flora of the Falklands to be cultivated in England.</p><p>Clayton was promoted commander on 1 August 1776 and captain on 23 April 1778. On reaching the top of the captain's list he was appointed superannuated rear admiral a few months before his death at Peckham in October 1795.</p><p>The inscription on the lead plate, which Clayton enclosed in his letter to Stephens reads:</p><blockquote><blockquote>Be it known to all Nations</blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>That Falkland's Island, with</blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>this Fort, the Storehouses, Wharfs, Harbours,</blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>Bays and Creeks thereunto belonging, are</blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>the sole Right and Property of his Most</blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>Sacred Majesty George the third</blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>King of Great Britain,</blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>France and Ireland Defender</blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>of the Faith.

        "body": "<p>farmer, and his twin sister Gwendolin Estelle (Molly) were born in Somerset on 22 October 1903, children of Howard Clement and Mabel, née Bertrand. The twins were baptised in the Falklands by Dean <a href=\"/biographies/brandon_lowther\">BRANDON</a>. Clement had an older sister and two younger brothers, all born in the Falklands. Clement was brought up at Roy Cove, the station owned by his grandfather, William Wickham <a href=\"/biographies/bertrand_william\">BERTRAND</a>, and managed by his father. He was a child of his time, growing up in Camp in great freedom, learning to ride, shoot, and row or sail a dinghy. The children were taught by their mother or a governess until 1916 when Mrs Clement took all the children to England to school.</p><p>Returning to the Islands in 1921, Clement began work at Roy Cove, gradually taking on more responsibility from his father as the years went on. He was very disappointed not to be appointed manager when his father retired in September 1933. Clement was appointed government stock inspector on 1 September 1933: his salary of £300 a year was supplemented by a £12 horse allowance, but he brought his own horses over to East Falkland. At this time scab* was still affecting sheep in the Islands, as well as ked*. Clement travelled widely, visiting farms while sheep were being shorn or dipped, and very often helping with the gathering and thus getting a good look at the flocks. It was also his job to personally oversee the quarantine and dipping at regular intervals of imported sheep. His diary for the first three weeks in 1934 gives an idea of the hundreds of miles covered. He went to Port Louis, Johnson's Harbour, Rincon Grande, Salvador, Douglas Station, Darwin, North Arm and then by boat across to Port Howard on the West Falkland, and on to Chartres.</p><p>Clement became manager for Packe Brothers Ltd in May 1934, taking over from HV Cobb. This was a very difficult station to run, consisting as it did of three sections, namely Dunnose Head, Packe's Port Howard and Fox Bay East. Although based at Fox Bay travelling was part and parcel of the job, and Clement spent many hours on horseback as he rode from one section to the next, taking part in the work and conferring with the overseers.</p><p>Clement was married in 1935 to Viola Mary (Babs) Luxton of Chartres, and they had two children, Sally Gwynfa (b1942), and Judith Orissa (b1945). Before the air service, Fox Bay was the main port of call for the mail boats and many people were offered hospitality as a matter of course as they rode in to catch the mail boat, or landed from it.</p><p>The early years were difficult: farming was in a bad way and there was no money for badly needed repairs, while the farm was stocked with Romney sheep which produced extremely coarse wool. Eventually New Zealand Hill Merino rams were imported and these were the foundation of the excellent sheep bred on the station. In 1960 Clement rather wistfully said: 'If only I could start all over again with the sheep I have today'. Respected for what he did rather than who he was, he was known as a very good stockman whose ability to pick top-class breeding stock was acknowledged by his peers. A good judge of character, he did not suffer fools gladly, and an often-heard exclamation of irritation was 'Goddammit man, do it this way!'</p><p>Clement was appointed to ExCo in 1950 and served for four years. When he retired to Stanley in 1967 he was nominated to LegCo in 1968. His interest in sheep and Camp matters continued for the rest of his life. He died in 1979.</p><p><a href=\"/biographies/chalfont_alun\">See Image 80</a></p>",

        "body": "<p>governor, was born on 16 February 1897 in Hammersmith, London, the son of Maurice, a painter and artist, and Aimee Grace, née Richards. He was educated privately and gained a diploma in Anthropology at University College London, later becoming a fellow of the College. He served in the 1914-1918 war and then with the Army of the Rhine from 1919 to 1920. Entering the Colonial Administrative Service (Nigeria) in 1921 he was acting resident Adamawa 1934-1937 and principal assistant secretary 1938-1941 before becoming involved in special duty for which he was subsequently honoured by the French government being awarded the <em>Medaille de la Resistance Francaise avec Rosette </em>. The citation for the award states:</p><blockquote><blockquote>The help given to General Leclerc and myself [General De Gaulle] at the time of the rallying of Cameroon and French Equatorial Africa was precious. Without his help it is possible that the mission would have not been successful and the outcome of the war could have been changed. Colonel Clifford had placed his absolute trust in us.</blockquote></blockquote><p>The French Resistance Medal was instituted in London by General de Gaulle in 1943 to 'recognise remarkable acts of faith and courage that have contributed, in France, the Empire and abroad, to the French people's resistance against the enemy'. The award was made in 1947 by the President of France after permission had been granted by the British government.</p><p>Following this special service, Clifford was seconded as colonial secretary Gibraltar 1942-1944, then senior resident Nigeria 1944 and chairman of the salaries commission Cyprus before being attached to the Colonial Office in 1946. In 1946 he became governor and commander-in-chief of the Falkland Islands, a post he held until 1954 despite attempts to remove him from office by petition. He arrived in November 1946 and immediately embarked on a policy of bringing the colony into the twentieth century. His first acts were to bring two unofficial members on to Legislative Council and to establish a Stanley Town Council, two acts alone which are at odds with the public perception of him as being autocratic. The Town Council comprised six elected members and three nominated by government. Universal suffrage was introduced in 1949 and in 1951 the Legislative Council was changed to comprise an unofficial majority. It must be said that the backgrounds of Clifford and, in particular his wife, were unsuited for the Islands which had previously been served by a succession of governors who were non-controversial and represented the flag without too much rippling of the waves. A world war had just ended but the colony was still following the procedures and lifestyle of the 1920s and 1930s.</p><p>In 1920 Clifford married Ivy Dorothy (Peta), youngest daughter of Arthur Robert Eland of Thrapston, Northants. His appointment as governor of the Falklands represented a challenge from which he did not flinch, but for his wife it was a step too far and she found the constraints of life as the first lady in a small close-knit community such that they affected her health and resulted in overindulgence in alcohol. It must be said that Clifford remained steadfastly loyal to his wife during this difficult period which ended in her untimely death. As the new governor he was faced with a multitude of problems upon his arrival following the end of World War II which had necessarily resulted in the Colony being run down and neglected through lack of resources. Faced with budget deficits Clifford scorned past policies of playing for time and introduced measures to increase revenue which antagonised the population and led to his unpopularity. He increased taxes and introduced  <em>ad valorem  </em>duties, which, while common elsewhere, were new to the Islands. Not all the much-needed funds could be raised in this way and the governor proved adept at securing grants from Britain, mainly from the Colonial Development and Welfare Fund, which were used on public works. The King Edward VII Memorial Hospital was modified and extended, for example, with new Xray plant and a fully-equipped dental surgery. Unfortunately, the major outlay on a freezer plant at Ajax Bay was unsuccessful through a combination of factors, principally wrong siting, clearly influenced by a decision not to favour the Falkland Islands Company, thus isolating the plant from its principal sources of supply in Lafonia. This poor siting was evident at an early stage with shipping delays hampering construction which was already obstructed by a stone run. Not completed until 1953, supplies of sheep were wholly insufficient and of poor quality, resulting in a rejection rate of almost 40%. The venture closed in 1955 and was dismissed as yet another example of profligate waste by the Colonial Development Corporation, which was already reeling from the debacle of the Groundnut Scheme in Tanganyika. The Ajax Bay disaster alienated the FIC's board of directors from the governor and probably was the reason that he was not invited to join the board, something to which he aspired and to which he had much to contribute.</p><p>Faced with so many problems, Clifford firmly identified them by visiting every farm settlement except one and many twice in his first year, and then declared his intention to visit in future on horseback or on the  <em>Philomel </em>in order to spend more time with farm workers and their families. He brought in from the UK a financial expert to overhaul the accounting system but ensured that succession was secured by sending an Islander to the UK for training. He also did this with Customs and Excise and both were highly successful. In education he abolished fees and improved facilities in the Camp. Navigation was improved by the installation of coastal lights at Fox Bay and Cape Dolphin in particular. The law was updated having previously been unchanged since before World War I. He negotiated an extremely favourable deal for Blackstone generators which formed the basis for the new power system for Stanley and astutely brought in from the Antarctic bases as superintendent a man who proved very successful. He did not neglect social and welfare provisions, introducing children's allowances and initiating contributory old age pensions.</p><p>Perhaps he is best remembered for introducing an internal air service in 1948, initially primarily for medical purposes but quickly extended to facilitate mail and passenger movement. Such a service had been discussed before the war but it was Clifford's drive and determination which brought it about. Initially the service was provided by two Auster wheeled aircraft but these were quickly changed to float planes which could fully utilise the advantage of farm settlements being sited at the water's edge. It cannot be emphasised too strongly the benefits to the farm population of an air service coupled with the installation of R/T sets. People in Camp were no longer isolated from Stanley.</p><p>The Governor was also responsible for the Dependencies and regularly visited them on warships. He would not tolerate any Argentine encroachment and on one notable occasion countered a provocative act by immediately sailing on a frigate, instructing the colonial secretary, who conveyed a last minute instruction from the Colonial Office not to proceed, to reply that the governor had already sailed. Although the governor was responsible for the Dependencies, their revenue had accrued to the British government from the early 1920s with the Falklands receiving an annual grant. Clifford got this increased by 150%.</p><p>The colony's coat of arms was changed in 1948 on his initiative and incorporated features introduced by him. When one reviews all the things that Clifford did for the Colony and its people it is difficult to reconcile with the deep-seated hostility towards him, although it must be said that his contribution is now becoming increasingly recognised by Islanders. Contrary to public opinion he was a modest man. This writer knew him well over a period of nearly 40 years and was unaware of his distinguished war record until preparing this biography. The Falklands had no more outspoken and loyal supporter during the difficult political period of the 1960s and 1970s than Sir Miles Clifford, who was vice-chairman of the Falkland Islands Emergency Committee, later the Falkland Islands Committee. He attended meetings regularly and no adverse or unsupportive comment could be made in the media without bringing forth a strong reaction from him.</p><p>Following the death of his first wife he married Mary, eldest daughter of Thomas Turner of Shelbyville, Illinois, USA, and lived happily in Kent until his death on 21 February 1986. He had followed a very active post-Falklands career in public service and was particularly involved in charitable work, notably in cancer research. During his time as a director of the Leverhulme Trust he was awarded an honorary fellowship in dental surgery for the Trust's financial help in establishing a Department of Dental Science. He never lost his love of the Antarctic and played a significant role in the organisation of the International Geophysical Year and the Trans-Antarctic Expedition. He also maintained a close interest in African affairs, notably Nigeria.</p>",

        "body": "<p>missionary, was born in Connecticut, USA in February 1801. He spent some years as a teacher, then studied theology and graduated in 1833. He was invited by the Boston Board of Missions to lead an exploratory voyage to Patagonia to see if a mission could be established among the Indians there. With the Reverend Mr Arms, Coan sailed from New York for the Straits of Magellan in August 1833 in the sealing schooner  <em>Mary Jane </em>under Captain William Clift, reaching their destination after an arduous voyage lasting 88 days.</p><p>The two men set up their Tent Tabernacle on the shore of the Magellan Straits on 16 November 1833 with few belongings (two saddles, a small medicine chest, some food, fishing tackle and clothes) which attracted the close interest of the natives. In January 1834, Coan and Arms decided they had had sufficient experience of primitive savages and were pleased to spot a sail in the Straits. They met the schooner  <em>Antarctic </em>of 173 tons from New York whose master, James Nash, offered to take them on board. They sailed from the Strait of Magellan on 26 January with the idea of taking stores in the Falkland Islands before finding another vessel to take them north and home. As they headed east out of the Strait, they passed a brig with the appearance of a man-of-war: it was HMS  <em>Beagle </em>with Charles <a href=\"/biographies/darwin_charles\">DARWIN</a> aboard.</p><p> <em>Antarctic </em>dropped anchor on 28 January in a quiet West Falkland bay and found the schooner  <em>Caroline </em>, also of New York, anchored nearby. A visit ashore for game was rewarded in a short time with 30 geese and ducks. The following day, a call was made first to Albemarle Harbour and then to another small island for some sealing among a sea lion colony. At daylight on 30 January, they proceeded up Falkland Sound passing two more vessels and anchoring at Salvador at 4pm. Landing in search of more game, they were greeted on the beach by a large sea elephant which was killed for its three barrels of oil.</p><p>On 1 February 1834, three men appeared on horseback on Salvador beach opposite the ship. The captain sent his boat ashore to communicate and established they were  <em>mestizos* </em>and Indians from Buenos Aires who lived in Port Louis but roamed the island slaughtering wild cattle and other game. Coan records: 'they are called gauchos; we hear that there has been a massacre in Port Louis of late'. The gauchos offered seven fat bullocks at US$ 5 per head and accepted payment in powder, balls, tobacco and rum. The next day, the ship's boat went on to another secluded bay and found seven armed Spaniards and Indians described as 'wild and suspicious' who were presumed to have been involved in the massacre the previous August. On 3 February, six more men appeared on the shore nearby armed with double-barrelled guns, pistols, dirks and knives and led by a Spaniard known as Captain Antook (Diego Antonio <a href=\"/biographies/rivero_antonio\">RIVERO)</a> and payment was made for the bullocks.</p><p>Next morning, a boat was sent to Rincon Grande beach and contact made with an Englishman and an Indian sent by the officer in charge, Lieutenant <a href=\"/biographies/smith_henry\">SMITH</a>, to enquire about the vessel. In the afternoon, the Englishman came aboard with a letter from Smith to Captain Nash containing details of the massacre. On 5 February, Smith came personally: he strongly disapproved of the trading between Nash and the assumed perpetrators of the massacre. He said that he viewed it as an act of hostility against His Majesty's Government and would have seized the  <em>Antarctic </em>if he had the means to do so.</p><p>After this unpromising start, relationships calmed down and Coan and Arms were invited to visit Port Louis, four and a quarter hour's walk away. Smith's house consisted of one room containing an old Franklin stove*, a table, an old sideboard, a dingy sofa, a chest of drawers, a crib and a few chairs: it was the room in which Matthew <a href=\"/biographies/brisbane_matthew\">BRISBANE</a> had been murdered. Coan and Arms spent a pleasant evening in conversation with Smith and returned to the ship at Salvador the next morning.</p><p>In all, Titus Coan spent 40 days travelling throughout the Falklands observing and recording the terrain, the wildlife and the men of many nations that he encountered. He left on board the schooner  <em>Talma </em>on 9 March 1834, arrived at New London on 7 May and subsequently reported to the Board that had sent him that it was not currently possible to establish a Mission in Patagonia.</p><p>That November, Coan married Fidelia Church and a month later they sailed as missionaries to the island of Hilo in Hawaii where Coan made a great impact. He became a powerful speaker in the local language and his energy, affectionate nature and charming personal presence brought great success. He is reported to have brought a total of 13,000 people into his Hilo church, the largest single congregation in the world. Much of this change in fortunes was clearly due to the wise aid and counsel of Mrs Coan, described as a woman of fine mind and great charm. She died in Hilo in September 1872 but Coan himself survived for another ten years. In 1880, Coan published his book  <em>Adventure in Patagonia </em>which includes a description of the months he spent with the Indians and of his time in the Falklands. </p>",

        "body": "<p>ornithologist, was born in Stanley on 16 February 1877, son of Frederick Edward <a href=\"/biographies/cobb_edward\">COBB</a>, colonial manager for the Falkland Islands Company and later its chairman, and Emily, née Blake. He obtained a BA degree at Oxford University, was elected a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society and at the age of 29, returned to the Falklands to manage the sheep farm on Bleaker Island leased from the FIC.</p><p>Throughout his time on Bleaker Island (at least 17 years) Cobb made notes on any unusual birds including descriptions with measurements of those that he shot, the number of eggs collected for consumption and any behaviour of birds or animals that he found interesting. He provides a fascinating insight into life on an island sheep farm in the first quarter of the twentieth century.</p><p>In May 1908, an Elephant Seal washed ashore at Darwin. A Russian Finn offered to skin it for a bottle of whisky and this took a fortnight at low tides. The bones were cleaned and packed in a crate and the hide soaked and rubbed with alum and saltpetre before being packed in casks. Rowland Ward, a well-known firm of London taxidermists, bought this specimen for £50 and after Cobb had spent about £13 on freight, he had sufficient funds to buy a Birdland plate camera. Cobb used this camera until at least 1922.</p><p>One of the smallest birds of the Falklands is named after Cobb. On 28 July 1908 on Carcass Island by the beach and ponds (probably North West Point), he shot a wren using rice as the charge. The specimen was skinned and sent to the Natural History Museum in London, where it was studied and described as a new species, Cobb's Wren <em>Troglodytes cobbi </em>. Though considered later by some ornithologists to be a form of the continental House Wren, it was confirmed (1993) as one of the two endemic bird species, with the Falkland Flightless Steamer Duck.</p><p>Through his keen interest in natural history and photography, he was commissioned by Gowans and Gray to supply 60 photographs 'from life' and write 'Notes on the Creatures' for one of their Nature Books, <em>Wild Life in the Falkland Islands </em>(1910). Three penguins and 18 other bird species were included with a Sea Elephant, Sea Lion and an octopus. The Upland Goose was described as useful because eggs, goslings and adults were eaten, the latter being 'considered in perfection when the diddle-dee berries (on which they feed largely) are ripe'. Otherwise, 'farmers have thousands destroyed annually in order to save [the grass] for the sheep'. In contrast the Kelp Goose which feeds on filamentous coastal seaweeds was 'ornamental, but not useful, as it is no good for food' but as it did no damage, was 'allowed to live in peace'. The Tussac birds were 'very tame and friendly' but also 'very quarrelsome among themselves' and ate house flies!</p><p>Cobb was one of the earliest to recognise and the first person to comment on the disastrous effects of introduced mammalian predators on small birds, writing (1910) that Tussac birds 'flourish on islands where there are no cats or rats'. He had similar interests to those of Arthur George <a href=\"/biographies/bennett_arthur\">BENNETT</a> and they maintained correspondence for over 45 years until Bennett's death in 1954.</p><p>Running a sheep farm on an isolated island, Cobb was necessarily self-sufficient and like most of his generation did not hesitate to exploit wildlife. He should, nevertheless, be recognised as a conservationist with Arthur <a href=\"/biographies/felton_arthur\">FELTON</a> of West Point Island. Cobb records that between May 1916 and June 1918, nearly 145,000 Tussac roots were planted on Bleaker in five paddocks. Cobb's records were apparently made in different notebooks between 1906 and 1923. It is significant that the great majority of his notes are dated. Many anecdotes are attributed to others but the following note is his:</p><blockquote><blockquote>25 August 1922: Shot a Turkey [Vulture] with ·303 rifle on 'Sister' [one of three small islands 10 km or 6 miles west of Bleaker settlement] when wrecked in <em>Exe </em>and ate it for breakfast at 6 am after it had stewed most of night, very good eating, far better than a goose we had had the day before.</blockquote></blockquote><p>Some years later his notes were copied into a hardbound book which has been preserved in the FIC archives. With the permission of Joan and Terry Spruce, most of the notes were tape-recorded in 1996 and typed to make a booklet of about 70 pages (by this author). A copy was deposited in the FIG Archives and later copied for the owners of Bleaker Island and their visitors.</p><p>Cobb's second book, <em>Birds of the Falkland Islands </em>was published by the well-known ornithological publisher, HF &amp; G Witherby of London in 1933, after he had retired to Sussex. He wrote that information had 'been acquired over a period of several years residence in the Falkland Islands in general and on Bleaker Island in particular.' He made the point that it was not compiled from publications or hearsay but 'from personal observation and contact with the birds, without which a treeless and isolated island would have been bleaker still.' He described about 30 species, outlining their appearance, habits and usefulness or otherwise to a sheep farmer. Referring to the wreck of the cutter <em>Exe </em>, he noted that he and his companion(s) 'had been spending rather a hungry couple of days and nights, surrounded by sea-lions' before eating the stewed Turkey Vulture. They were lucky to be rescued! Reviews in at least ten publications from the <em>Times Literary Supplement </em>and the <em>Liverpool Post and Mercury </em>to the <em>Worthing Herald </em>comment on the 'actual field work' described and show that with 'the charm of novelty and the power to arouse desire' the book 'deserves high praise' and was seen as a valuable firsthand account with excellent photographs.</p><p>Cobb's books remain intriguing records of a naturalist-farmer's involvement with the wildlife among which he lived and worked. He made an important contribution to Falkland Islands ornithology through his keen observations, careful note taking, photography and collection of bird specimens. It is fitting that he should be remembered in the name of the [Vulnerable] endemic Cobb's Wren, which only survives on predator-free islands. A modest likeable man he lived in quiet retirement in Sussex, but always retained a close interest in the Falkland Islands. Not wealthy, he none the less established a modest fund for the benefit of employees of the FIC, which was administered by the two most senior managers of the Company in the Islands.</p>",

        "body": "<p>FIC manager, was born at Banbury, Oxon on 16 April 1845, one of ten children of Edward Cobb <em>,  </em>a banker, and Octavia Cobb, née Piper. He attended University College School at Oxford. The earliest photograph of him at the age of 18 shows him bewhiskered and looking older than his years. His early training in an East Indian office gave him a sound knowledge of accounts and administration and he was appointed Colonial Manager of the Falkland Islands Company at the age of 22, a remarkable and enlightened decision by the Board of Directors in London (one of whom was an uncle), made at a time when the Company was struggling to establish itself. It took him 57 days to travel to the Falklands, the final stage being a journey from Montevideo to Port Stanley in the small schooner <em>Foam </em>, an experience which he later remarked was one that he would willingly have foregone. He arrived at Port Stanley on 6 August 1867 and the Board in London only learned of his safe arrival four months after he set out.</p><p>It was his disagreeable first task to dismiss the incumbent manager <em> </em>James <a href=\"/biographies/lane_james\">LANE</a> who left the Islands at the next opportunity on 1 September 1867. For the first month Cobb was entirely alone in the Company's office and he quickly realised that of the two principal businesses, retailing and farming, it was the latter which must be the focal point for the Company's future prosperity. Although ostensibly senior to the Camp manager, a Scotsman, Cobb knew that interference with him and his policies would not be countenanced by the Board. Nonetheless, Cobb formed the view that the Board's confidence was misplaced and that the Camp manager was not competent to hold such a responsible position. Cobb was particularly concerned over the problem of scab* for which the manager's policy of dressing the sheep with hot penguin oil and tar was proving disastrous for sheep survival and the growing of wool. When a group of sheep farmers arrived in the Falkland Islands prospecting for land and opportunities, Cobb negotiated a contract with one of them, Wickham <a href=\"/biographies/bertrand_william\">BERTRAND</a>, and dismissed the Camp manager. Cobb realised that he had jeopardised his own position and he was duly censured by the Board for not consulting them beforehand but his reasons were upheld and the decision proved wholly justified. Bertrand had dips constructed and in 1869 the entire flock was dipped in a mixture of tobacco and sulphur which brought about a marked immediate improvement and the eventual elimination of scab. Flocks quickly expanded rising from 22,000 in 1868 to over 200,000 in the 1890s.</p><p>Bertrand left after two years in 1870 to farm elsewhere in the colony whereupon Cobb assumed direct control of sheep farming, moving to the Company's main farming headquarters at Darwin although retaining overall control as colonial manager, a dual appointment unique in the Company's long history. He was a man of culture and he took great pleasure in writing forthright letters to the Board in London, even writing about such mundane matters as pillows, describing one recent consignment as showing an economy of feathers. He married a West Country girl Emily Blake in April 1873, a happy and successful union for both himself and the Falklands, for Emily's brother Robert <a href=\"/biographies/blake_robert\">BLAKE</a> joined her in the Islands and established himself in partnership with Ernest <a href=\"/biographies/holmested_ernest\">HOLMESTED</a>, a very successful sheep farmer at Hill Cove, West Falkland. The Cobbs had three children: Florence Emily (b1874), Ethel Winifred (b1874) and Arthur Frederick <a href=\"/biographies/cobb_arthur\">COBB</a> (b1877). Two of Cobb's brothers, Henry and George, came out and farmed for many years at Lively Island. Some sensitivity existed within the Company over the granting of leases to members of his family, but FE Cobb prevailed. As the sheep farming business grew, Cobb relinquished the farm management in 1889.</p><p>One vitally important responsibility was shipping, over which he clashed with governors on policy, one of them, <a href=\"/biographies/callaghan_jeremiah\">CALLAGHAN</a>, declaring that Cobb was not in favour of steam, a palpable nonsense. The Company had long been urging the Liverpool based Pacific Steam Navigation Company to extend its service to the West Coast of South America on to the Falklands, with Cobb securing promises from independent farming clients to ship their wool with the Company's on steamers calling at Port Stanley. PSNC were not, however, interested at the time although under pressure they did submit a price which was clearly intended for rejection. Cobb engineered the introduction of steam communication for the Islands in 1880 although the governor claimed the credit for it. The Company held talks in London with the German Line Kosmos and following this one of their ships called at Port Stanley where Cobb negotiated a deal with them, subject to Board approval in London, for the carriage of cargo to and from England. A mail contract was then entered into with the Falkland Islands Government which lasted for 20 years. It would not have been concluded without the Company's support, as the mail contract payment did not even cover the cost of diversion. Cobb always defended the Company against any accusations of unfair monopoly by pointing out that it had voluntarily relinquished the external shipping monopoly in the Colony's overall interests.</p><p>Cobb had earlier clashed with the governor over the mail subsidy which was intended to fund external journeys to Montevideo by the Company's schooner  <em>Black Hawk </em>. The Company was making increasing losses on shipping and Cobb was determined to stop this but the governor refused to increase the subsidy. Cobb therefore gave six months notice of termination of the mail contract which would give the Company the flexibility of external movement it required, the schooner having been occupied for 275 days on the external mail service in 1879, about 55 days per round voyage. The Government passed legislation in February 1880 requiring the masters of all vessels to carry mail for a fee of 1d. per letter which would have entailed a payment to the Company of less than £25 for a voyage to Montevideo, a derisory amount. In March Cobb sent the  <em>Black Hawk </em>to Montevideo and instructed the master not to accept mail for the Falklands unless an adequate sum was paid for the service. Cobb meanwhile had arranged for the Company's mail to be sent to its agent in Montevideo for collection. When the Company's agent proposed a fee of £150 for the round trip the British Vice Consul <em> </em>in the city telegraphed home recommending approval, holding the vessel pending a response. The governor intervened, however, and arranged for the German vessel  <em>Ramses </em>to divert to Port Stanley with the mail en route to Valparaiso in Chile, paying £150 for this rather than accede to the Company. The Company wrote to the Colonial Office declaring that Governor Callaghan had acted in a very high-handed manner in the mail service negotiations but the minister expressed his support for the governor although subsequent release of the papers to the public show a marginal note 'The Governor has misled us'. The governor's term of office was up and Cobb in 1880 had achieved his main objectives: introducing a steam shipping service; and stemming the Company's shipping losses. He was a happy man. His feelings about governors at the time are reflected in his belief that the farmer who gave the fattest lambs to Government House was most likely to find favour.</p><p>Cobb continued his work in establishing the Company's financial position. The sheep flocks were expanding and had reached 100,000 by 1880, the retailing and ship repairing businesses were trading profitably after the takeover of the principal competitor, JM Dean and Sons, following Cobb's initiative when he learned in Montevideo of the death of the principal George <a href=\"/biographies/dean_george1\">DEAN</a>. It is interesting to observe that until the Company was itself taken over in 1972 there was always a member of the Cobb family on the Board and until the 1950s, a Dean. Cobb believed that meat processing would not be profitable because of the comparatively low numbers available, a lesson which the Colonial Development Corporation learned in costly fashion in the aftermath of World War II. Instead, Cobb had a boiling down plant built for surplus sheep and created a useful market in tallow. In 1880 too, Cobb personally built a telephone line between his house and the office in Stanley, the first in the colony. He would have responded vigorously perhaps to the first date given inaccurately in relation to the recent issue of commemorative stamps but not as vigorously as his response to the inaccuracies in VF <a href=\"/biographies/boyson_violet\">BOYSON</a>'s book on the Falklands.</p><p>In 1890 Cobb was an established figure in the Falklands, well respected for his achievements in securing the future of the Colony as well as being personally liked. He had boundless energy and was more interested in his work than its rewards, something which sets him apart from today's entrepreneurs. His frustration over managing an organization 7,000 miles away from the controlling Board of Directors in London and subject to their approval on important policy matters finally came to a head in 1891 when he resigned, ostensibly because of the failure of the Company's secretary to send him a copy of the Company's published report and accounts and his newspapers 'without which life here would not be worth living'. Upon his return to England the Board did the only thing they could do - they offered him the managing directorship which Cobb accepted. His first action was to dismiss the Company secretary which was perhaps a little harsh because he was a hard working, conscientious man. His subsequent years until retirement in 1914 were less confrontational but nonetheless successful, placing the Company on a sound basis. From the eyes of his successors as colonial manager Cobb suffered from the same shortcomings as he himself had complained about, restriction of funds for development, limited delegation of authority and failure to listen to arguments. The Company continued to prosper however, undoubtedly assisted by his appointment of a highly successful and popular colonial manager, WA <a href=\"/biographies/harding_william\">HARDING</a>, who served during most of Cobb's time as managing director.</p><p>Cobb became chairman of the Company in 1914 and served until his final retirement in 1922 during which time he introduced a policy of switching to finer wool in response to market demand resulting, in 1923, in the Company topping the London wool market. In retirement in Sussex, Cobb served, as a director of Holmested Blake &amp; Co of Hill Cove with his brother-in-law, Robert <a href=\"/biographies/blake_robert\">BLAKE</a>, until his death on 27 October 1934. Cobb was a man of his time, maturing during the Victorian era of expansion and development of the British Empire, fostered by the creation of Royal Chartered Companies whose unique powers attracted financial backing. Cobb dominated Falkland Islands Company affairs from 1867 when he became colonial manager to 1922 <em> </em>when he retired from the chairmanship in London. The minutes of the Board meeting of the Falkland Islands Company for 7 November 1934 record on his death:</p><blockquote><blockquote>to him more than to any other man is due the credit for the successful development and progress of the Company during the forty-seven years he was actively associated with its management in the Colony and in London.</blockquote></blockquote><p>He is commemorated by his portrait on a stamp in the FIC's one hundred and fiftieth anniversary set in 2002.</p><p><a href=\"/biographies/terriss_william\">See Image 340</a></p>",

        "body": "<p>chairman FIC and racing driver, was born on 2 December 1899, the son of Rhodes Hawtyn Cobb of Esher, Surrey, a director of the Falkland Islands Company and chairman from 1922 to 1929. He was educated at Eton and Trinity Hall, Cambridge, and in the early 1920s developed his love of speed by racing at Brooklands, Surrey, where he established many records including the track lap record of 143·44mph. Before World War II Cobb became world-renowned racing his Napier-Railton car in the USA to such effect that he held all the world records for time and distance up to 24 hours. Upon the outbreak of war he enlisted in the Royal Air Force having learned to fly at Brooklands but to his dismay was prevented from becoming a fighter pilot because his size made it difficult for him to get in and out of cockpits. It was not until 1943 that he flew regularly as an Air Transport Auxiliary ferry pilot. After the war Cobb resumed racing and in 1947 at Utah, USA increased his own world land speed record from 369·7mph to 394·2mph in the process becoming the first man to exceed 400mph for which he was awarded the Segrave Trophy.</p><p>Cobb was a big man in both stature and status but extremely modest and shy. His profession was that of a skin and fur broker and he was joint managing director of Anning, Chadwick &amp; Kiver Ltd in the City of London which sold the colony's output of sheepskins and hides. Before the war Cobb was commissioned by the Soviet government to sell the annual Russian pelt stock. He visited the Islands in 1946, when he flew from the newly opened Heathrow Airport to Montevideo and sailed on to the Islands on the maiden voyage of SS <em>Lafonia </em>(formerly SS <em>Perth </em>). He married Elizabeth Mitchell-Smith in 1947 and was devastated when she died from Bright's disease 14 months later. He later married Vera Henderson in 1950 and it was this event and the fact that he had just been elected chairman of the Falkland Islands Company that resulted in an impassioned plea by the managing director of the Company for him to abandon his attempt at the world Water Speed Record in 1952. Cobb had not previously been involved on water but was determined to attempt the record on his boat <em>Crusader </em>. On 29 September 1952 at Loch Ness the boat exceeded 200mph but then crashed killing Cobb.</p><p>The eulogies were many but perhaps are best summarised by the Duke of Richmond who described him thus:</p><blockquote><blockquote>An Englishman becoming very great and carrying his fame with ease quite impossible to anyone with a trace of vanity or conceit. In such a man of action and achievement his intense wisdom could perhaps be expected but it was accompanied by a rare gentleness and sense of humour which made his companionship so much a joy to his friends.</blockquote></blockquote><p>Cobb came from a family with strong ties to the Falkland Islands stretching back to 1867. His father died in 1930, the year after John joined the Board of Directors. His own death in 1952, a fortnight after his appointment as chairman, was a great loss to the Falkland Islands Company.</p>",

He was educated at George Watson's Hospital in Edinburgh from 1861-1868 and then apprenticed for five years to a firm of tea merchants in Edinburgh. In his entry for the Colonial Office List he claimed to have passed the Edinburgh University local exam with honours in mathematics and history in 1867 and to have won the Edinburgh Merchants' Co prize for an essay on direct and indirect taxation in 1873. He also claimed to have studied at Kings College London. In December 1874 he was appointed government schoolmaster to the public school in Stanley. He next entered the colonial administration becoming in May 1878 Justice of the Peace, and then treasurer. (A Colonial Office minute noted: 'Governor <a href=\"/biographies/callaghan_jeremiah\">CALLAGHAN</a> tells me that Mr Collins is a very shrewd fellow'). He went on to become collector of customs, registrar and acting colonial secretary with a seat on ExCo. Unfortunately his honesty was suspect and during the visit of HMS <em>Dwarf </em>in 1881, Governor <a href=\"/biographies/kerr_thomas\">KERR</a> invited the ship's paymaster, Horwill, to check the accounts. The paymaster's report of 29 December noted grave errors in the accounts and Collins was apprehended. His locked cupboard was broken open and a wealth of incriminating evidence came to light. Collins had been suppressing despatches and registered letters, stealing cash from the mails and selling highly prized mint Falklands stamps to Stanley Gibbons and collectors in England. 'The Governor is so good-hearted he wants to let this man off, which would be utterly useless as he is a drunkard too', noted the <em>Dwarf' </em>s Captain <a href=\"/biographies/wiseman_william\">WISEMAN</a>. Collins was tried on several charges by the Falklands Islands Supreme Court with the Governor presiding as judge. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to seven years penal servitude on 13 January 1882. After a year in gaol in Stanley, he was shipped to Malta as the Falklands had no facilities for long-term prisoners. In October 1885 he was released from Corradino Prison and went to Australia.</p>",

        "body": "<p>Operation Condor was the hijacking of an airliner to Stanley by a group of Argentine nationalists on 28 September 1966. The origins of Operation Condor are linked to the Argentine political organisation Tacuara*, a Catholic nationalist group created in 1955 by young activists with diverse backgrounds but a shared anti-Semitic, bigoted and radical view of political affairs. Many of its members later joined Peronist and Trotskyist armed groups, most notably the Montoneros and the People's Revolutionary Army (ERP). On 9 June 1961 a section of Tacuara established the New Argentina Movement (MNA), which was one of the first right-wing groups of the Peronist party. Among MNA's founding members were the journalist Dardo Manuel Cabo (1941-1977), son of the metalworkers' leader Armando Cabo, and the student Alejandro Giovenco (1945-1974). In 1965, when Juan Domingo <a href=\"/biographies/peron_juan\">PERÓN</a>'s third wife Isabel Martínez visited Buenos Aires, these two were among her personal bodyguards. Cabo and Giovenco were to be Operation Condor's commander and second-in-command.</p><p>On 28 August 1963, a revolutionary faction of Tacuara held up the Policlínico Bancario hospital in Buenos Aires, taking cash reserved for salaries worth over US $100,000. This attack was the first of a long series of violent urban guerrilla operations in the second half of the twentieth century. Dardo Cabo did not participate directly in the attack, however he was arrested in 1964 through links to its organisers. One of the these, Horacio Rossi, an experienced militant who had been expelled from the navy, received US $500 from the bank raid and went to Bahía Blanca to charter a ship, the  <em>Río Segundo </em>, which he proposed to sail to Port Stanley with twenty or thirty combatants in order to invade the Islands and drive out the English. The operation was named after Antonio <a href=\"/biographies/rivero_antonio\">RIVERO</a>, and the plan proposed to offer the Islands to the exiled ex-president Juan Domingo Perón to use as a base for his return to Argentina. However Rossi had to face other responsibilities and got married after learning that his fiancée had become pregnant. The funds were reassigned to establish a publishing house, Editora del Sur, which edited a paper of the Peronist Youth organisation.</p><p>Dardo Cabo and Alejandro Giovenco pressed on with the plan, and renamed it Operation Condor to symbolise the national rebellion against the imperialist forces. They were joined by the journalist and playwright María Cristina Verrier (b1939), the only woman in the group and the daughter of César Verrier, justice of the supreme court and minister <em> </em>during the administration of President Frondizi in 1958-1961. The eighteen members of the group were carefully presented as university students, manual labourers, and white-collar employees, and their average age was twenty-four. Some of them met for the first time in the aircraft. Supporters in Buenos Aires and Río Gallegos liaised with the press and the authorities.</p><p>On Wednesday, 28 September 1966 an armed group hijacked flight 648 of Aerolíneas Argentinas on its regular run from Buenos Aires to Río Gallegos and Ushuaia, and forced the pilot Ernesto Fernández García to fly off-course to the Falkland Islands. At 8.42am, the Douglas DC4, LV-AGG, landed on Stanley racecourse. The hijackers landed from the aircraft and hoisted seven Argentine flags, trying at the same time to keep the Islanders, who thought this was an emergency landing, away. The group delivered a formal statement in English (although addressed chiefly to the Argentine public) to reaffirm Argentine sovereignty over the Islands. They invited the Islanders to adopt Argentine citizenship, and renamed the Islands - Malvinas and Port Stanley - Puerto Rivero. They went on to seize seven hostages. At this, the Islands' authorities blocked in the aircraft using Landrovers.</p><p>Among the thirty-four passengers of flight 648 was, by chance, Rear-Admiral José M Guzmán, military governor of Tierra del Fuego, (which included, in Argentine law, the Antarctic territories, the Falklands/Malvinas and South Atlantic islands). Another passenger was Héctor Ricardo García (b1930), journalist and editor of  <em>Crónica </em>newspaper and  <em>Así </em>magazine of Buenos Aires, who claimed to have been invited to witness the operation without knowing its details, but who was in fact its principal promoter. His paper,  <em>Crónica </em>was an innovator among the sensational press, characterised by oversized headlines, generous use of illustrations, and dramatic rhetoric, particularly in sports and show business news. Two years before,  <em>Crónica </em>had provided press coverage to Miguel L <a href=\"/biographies/fitzgerald_miguel\">FITZGERALD</a> when he landed in Stanley and returned to Argentina. Two years later, García would personally accompany Fitzgerald on his second flight, using  <em>Crónica' </em>s private aircraft. The Malvinas were a hot-selling subject for the sensational press in Argentina, and Héctor García was an expert in exploiting these matters. He was proud of sending his journalists and photographers to create rather than simply report the news.</p><p>When the news of Operation Condor arrived in Buenos Aires and was publicised <em> </em>by García's media, the military government headed by president Juan Carlos Onganía reacted against it and took legal action against the group. Except for some isolated support among nationalist circles and certain labour unions, most people saw Operation Condor as a sporting exploit, on the same lines as Col Jorge Leal's military expedition to Antarctica in February of that year, rather than as a political statement. However, that evening some rioting took place at the residence of the British ambassador in Buenos Aires and the consular office in Rosario.</p><p>The day of the landing at Stanley, through the mediation of Governor Guzmán and the Catholic priest Father Rudolph <a href=\"/biographies/roel_rudolph\">ROEL</a>, the passengers and part of the crew left the aircraft and were accommodated in private homes, and the following day they were sent to Buenos Aires via Montevideo. Fr Rudolph Roel celebrated a mass in Spanish in the aircraft, and all hostages were set free. The following day, the hijackers refused to surrender to the Falkland Islands Government, but accepted Fr Roel's proposal to give up their arms and to be confined in the Catholic church in Stanley. On 1 October, after tedious negotiations, attempts by the Islanders to recover the Argentine flags, and public performances of the Argentine national anthem by the failed invaders, the latter were finally taken to the Argentine navy transport  <em>Bahía Buen Suceso </em>, and sailed to Ushuaia, where they landed on 5 October 1966. Three days later, in a delicate operation, the Douglas DC4 took off from Stanley racecourse and arrived safely at Río Gallegos the same evening.</p><p>Nine months after being held by the police in Ushuaia and Río Grande, fifteen members of the Condor group were released, while three were held in Bahía Blanca for the judicial hearings. On 13 October 1967 a federal high court confirmed the sentences of three and a half years imposed on Dardo Cabo, Alejandro Giovenco and Juan Carlos Rodríguez on the charges of illegal deprivation of liberty, aggravated by use of violence and illegal possession of weapons. The charges of theft of an aircraft and seizure of hostages were dismissed.</p><p>While he was in prison, Dardo Cabo married María Cristina Verrier, and they had a daughter, María. In the late 1960s, Cabo joined the left-wing forces of Peronism, heading commandos of the Montoneros guerrilla group. In the 1970s he was a high-ranking officer of the organisation and edited its paper  <em>El Descamisado </em>. Cabo was kidnapped in 1975 in greater Buenos Aires and was executed on 7 January 1977 by a military death squad when being transported from the penitentiary number nine of La Plata. Alejandro Giovenco, who in the early 1970s created an extreme right-wing group of Peronists, died in 1974 when trying to place a bomb in the Peronist Youth headquarters. Only two of the seven Condor group members who died before 2004 died of natural causes.</p><p>Besides the weak support which Operation Condor attracted in Argentina, the operation's major consequence was the immediate cooling of the negotiations undertaken by Argentina and the United Kingdom at the United Nations. UN General Assembly resolution 2065 adopted on 16 December 1965, which recommended a peaceful solution to decolonise the Islands did not prosper. The attitude of the military in Argentina hardened, paving the way to armed conflict. In the Islands, the incident is often called the first aerial hijack.</p>",

He then left for Whitby, where he became apprenticed to John Walker, a highly respected Quaker shipowner, whose ships were employed in the North Sea coal trade. Cook spent the next eleven years in these highly dangerous waters which were subject to violent storms, shifting sandbanks and uncharted shoals - a valuable lesson in seamanship and navigation that was to serve him well later in his career. In 1755 Cook was offered the command of one of Walker's ships, but instead, on 17 June 1755, he enlisted in the Royal Navy as an able seaman as he was determined 'to take his future fortune that way'.</p><p>Cook's abilities were soon recognised and on 29 June 1757 he passed the examination for master and thus became responsible for the navigation and handling of ships of the Royal Navy. On 26 July 1758, as master of the 60 gun  <em>Pembroke </em>, he was present at the surrender of Louisburg in French Canada. The following day Cook went ashore where he met Major Samuel Holland, an army officer who was making a plan of the fortress with a plane table. Cook invited Holland on board the  <em>Pembroke </em>to explain the use of this instrument. From this time Cook took an active interest in hydrographic surveying. The following June Cook was one of several masters of the fleet that surveyed and marked The Traverse, the principal hazard in the St Lawrence River, thus enabling the entire British fleet to pass safely through and attack Quebec. After the fall of Quebec Cook was appointed master of the 70 gun  <em>Northumberland </em>, and during the next three and a half years surveyed Halifax Harbour, compiled sailing directions of the Gulf of St Lawrence and studied the theory of navigation. In July the  <em>Northumberland </em>played a prominent part in the brief campaign leading to the recapture of St John's, Newfoundland, from the French, enabling Cook to carry out a number of important surveys, which led to his appointment as marine surveyor to chart the north and west coasts of Newfoundland. First, however, Cook returned to England in the  <em>Northumberland  </em>where he was discharged and where, on 21 December 1762, he married Elizabeth Batts in St Margaret's Church, at Barking in London.</p><p>On returning to Newfoundland in the early summer of 1763, Cook first <em> </em>surveyed the islands of Saint Pierre and Miquelon, which were to be restored to France. Over the next four years he surveyed the northern, western and southern coasts of Newfoundland in the specially purchased 68 ton schooner  <em>Grenville </em>, spending the winter months back in London, working on his charts in his house in Mile End, returning to St John's the following spring. In 1766, with permission from the Admiralty, Cook began publishing his surveys and sailing directions, which were eventually incorporated in the famous  <em>North American Pilot </em>, published by Sayer and Bennett in 1775. They remained in use for many years.</p><p><strong>The First Voyage</strong></p><p>When Cook returned to England in November 1767, the Royal Society was planning an expedition to the South Pacific to observe the transit of Venus across the face of the Sun, which would enable the distance between the Earth and the Sun to be calculated. The Admiralty, who were to provide the ship, insisted that it should be commanded by a naval officer, and so Cook was promoted lieutenant and on 25 May 1768 was appointed in command of the Whitby-built  <em>Endeavour </em>of 336 tons, joining her two days later. Among the scientists who took part in the expedition were the astronomer Charles Green, appointed by the Royal Society to observe the transit of Venus, with Cook as the second observer, and Joseph Banks, a wealthy amateur botanist, bringing with him his own scientific team and artists. The island of Tahiti, whose longitude had recently been determined by Samuel Wallis, was chosen for the observation.</p><p>Cook sailed from Plymouth on 25 August 1768 and, after calling at Madeira and Río de Janeiro, passed well to the west of the Falklands, before rounding Cape Horn and anchoring in Matavai Bay on the north coast of Tahiti on 13 April 1769. After successfully observing the transit on 3 June, Cook sailed due south as far as 40°S to search for the great southern continent that geographers considered must exist in the Southern Ocean. Failing to sight land Cook then altered course to the west to investigate the land seen by Abel Tasman in 1642, eventually encountering the east coast of New Zealand on 6 October. Cook then spent the next six months carrying out a running survey of New Zealand's North and South Islands, during which he was able to determine his longitude with considerable accuracy by means of the newly-established method of lunar distances.</p><p>Cook next carried out a running survey of the unknown east coast of Australia in which his discovery of Botany Bay was to have a significant effect on the history of that continent. He then made for Batavia {Jakarta} in the Dutch East Indies for repairs. In sailing through Endeavour Strait Cook confirmed the discovery of Luis Vaez de Torres in 1606 that Australia was not joined to New Guinea as shown on most maps. Before his final departure from Australia Cook took possession of the whole of the east coast of Australia in the name of King George III, naming it New South Wales. After further calls at Table Bay and St Helena, Cook finally anchored in the Downs on 12 June 1771. During the voyage thirty members of the ship's company and Banks's party had died mainly due to illnesses contracted in Batavia. As a result of the success of the voyage Cook was promoted to commander on 29 August 1771.</p><p><strong>The Second Voyage</strong></p><p>In spite of the achievements of Cook's first voyage it was clear that there were vast areas in the Southern Ocean where a southern continent might still be found. Cook therefore proposed that a search for it should be made by circumnavigating the globe from west to east in a high southern latitude, thereby taking advantage of the strong prevailing westerly winds to be found there. Cook's plan was accepted and, as  <em>Endeavour </em>had been sent out to Port Egmont with supplies, two further Whitby-built vessels were purchased and named  <em>Resolution </em>and  <em>Adventure </em>, Cook being given command of the former and Tobias Furneaux command of the latter. As a result of disagreements, Banks did not accompany the expedition, his place being taken by the German-born scientist Johann Reinhold <a href=\"/biographies/forster_johann\">FORSTER</a> and his son George <a href=\"/biographies/forster_johann\">FORSTER</a>. An important secondary aim of the expedition was to give extended trials to a copy of John Harrison's prize-winning chronometer H4 made by Larcum Kendall, known as K1, and three other chronometers made to the design of John Arnold.</p><p>Cook sailed from Plymouth on 13 July 1772. After calling at Table Bay, he set a course to the south, and on encountering numerous tabular bergs, altered course to the east to begin his first ice-edge cruise. On 17 January 1773 he became the first person to cross the Antarctic Circle. On 9 February during an unsuccessful search in lower latitudes for land discovered by Kerguelen in 1772, the two ships became separated in a fog. When contact was not regained Cook decided to continue his sweep to the south before the onset of the southern winter, reaching Dusky Sound, in New Zealand's South Island on 27 March 1773, after a passage lasting four months without sighting land. He remained there for six weeks refreshing his crew and surveying this extensive inlet before rejoining Furneaux at the agreed rendezvous in Queen Charlotte Sound off the Canadian Pacific coast.</p><p>On 7 June, with Furneaux in company, Cook got under way and after an uneventful passage anchored on 26 August in Matavai Bay. He then spent the next two months working his way back to Queen Charlotte Sound through the Society Islands and Tonga. Off the east coast of New Zealand's North Island the two ships were struck by a severe gale and on 30 October became separated for a second time. After waiting in vain for three weeks for Furneaux in Queen Charlotte Sound, Cook sailed on his second ice-edge cruise. On 26 January 1774 he crossed the Antarctic Circle for the third time and four days later, at 71°10'S, 106°54'W, achieved his farthest south. Cook now decided to spend one more winter in the South Pacific so that he could explore the South Atlantic during the following summer. Making his way back to Tahiti, Cook anchored briefly off Easter Island, the first land to be sighted for 104 days. He next called at the Marquesas before anchoring once more in Matavai Bay on 22 April. After spending a few weeks in the Society Islands Cook set off once again for Queen Charlotte Sound, visiting Tonga for a second time and carrying out running surveys of the New Hebrides {Vanuatu} and the north-eastern side of New Caledonia. In Queen Charlotte Sound he learnt that Furneaux had arrived a few days after his departure and had sailed some days later. On 11 November Cook set off on the long voyage home, spending Christmas at anchor in the appropriately named Christmas Sound in Tierra del Fuego before exploring the South Atlantic.</p><p><strong>South Georgia</strong></p><p>After examining the north coast of Staten Island, Cook began his third ice-edge cruise. His intention was to continue his search for the supposed southern continent in the South Atlantic. To assist him he had a recently published chart by Alexander Dalrymple, which showed the tracks of Edmund Halley in the  <em>Paramore </em>in 1700 and Jean-Baptiste-Charles Bouvet de Lozier in the  <em>Eagle </em>( <em>Aigle </em>) <em> </em>and  <em>Mary  </em>( <em>Marie </em>) <em> </em>in 1739. Dalrymple's chart also showed an extensive coastline between about 53° and 63° South and between about 40° and 55° West of Greenwich, named Golfo de St Sebastiano, taken from Ortelius's map of 1586. At the northern end of this gulf, Dalrymple had charted Strait de la Roche and the track of Antonio de la <a href=\"/biographies/roche_antonio\">ROCHE</a> in 1675.</p><p>Although doubting the gulf's existence, Cook set his course from Staten Island towards its supposed western entrance so he could survey its coastline thoroughly should it be encountered. On reaching this position without sighting land, Cook then altered course northward to search for Strait de la Roche, whose existence seemed more likely as, according to Dalrymple, land had also been seen in this vicinity in 1756 by the  <em>Lion </em>. The  <em>León </em>, to give its correct spelling, was a Spanish merchant ship which was carried eastward from Cape Horn during a storm when on a voyage from Valparaiso to Spain. On 29 June the  <em>León </em>sighted a small island and then more extensive land in 54°50'S, which remained in sight for three days. When there were no signs of land in the position assigned to the strait on Dalrymple's chart, Cook decided to run down its latitude and was rewarded, on 14 January 1775, by the sight of snow-covered mountains - the land now known as South Georgia.</p><p>Because of its mountainous appearance Cook thought the land to be extensive and decided to explore its northern coast, which he reached by passing through Stewart Strait, between Willis and Bird Islands off its NW extremity. He then coasted along its north coast until 16 January, when he anchored for the night. The following morning he stood in for the land and when an inlet was sighted, Cook decided to explore it in the hope of finding a suitable anchorage. A boat was lowered and, with Cook leading the party personally, the approaches were sounded, but the depths were too great and it was decided not to bring the  <em>Resolution </em>in. However, Cook landed 'in three different places, displayed our Colours and took possession of the Country in his Majesty's name under a descharge of small Arms', naming the inlet Possession Bay. The Forsters, who accompanied Cook, found only three plants, while some seals were killed to provide fresh meat for the ship's company. Numerous seabirds were sighted and also the first sighting was made of the South Georgian Teal ( <em>Anas georgica </em>).</p><p>Cook then continued working his way along the north coast of the island until eventually he rounded a point from where he could see that the land he had explored was only a medium sized island thus dispelling the hopes he had entertained that it might be part of an extensive continent. However, he confessed 'the disappointment I now met with did not affect me much, for to judge of the bulk by the sample it would not be worth the discovery. This land I called the  <em>Isle of Georgia </em>in honor of H. Majesty'. He named the point Cape Disappointment, one of a number of Cook's names, including Cape Saunders, Cape George, Cape Charlotte and Cumberland Bay, which still survive. Cook made his departure from South Georgia on 20 January, commenting:</p><blockquote><blockquote>The inner parts of the Country was not less savage and horrible: the Wild rocks raised their lofty summits till they were lost in the Clouds and the Vallies laid buried in everlasting Snow. Not a tree or shrub was to be seen, no not even big enough to make a tooth-pick.</blockquote></blockquote><p>On 23 January Cook encountered a group of rocky islets, situated between 35 and 40 miles ESE of South Georgia, which he named Clerke Rocks after Charles Clerke his second lieutenant. On 27 January ice was encountered and four days later land was sighted once again. Cook altered course to the north and, in foggy conditions, a series of islands and capes were sighted in the distance. After 100 miles, when no further land was sighted, Cook altered course to the east and then to the south, concluding the land he had sighted was either a group of islands or the tip of an icy continent, which it would be imprudent to explore. He named this partly explored land Sandwich Land, now the South Sandwich Islands.</p><p>After calling at Table Bay, St Helena, Ascension and Fayal in the Azores, Cook dropped anchor in Spithead on 30 July after an absence of three years and eighteen days, during which four men had died, but only one from sickness and none from scurvy - a remarkable achievement.</p><p><strong>The Last Voyage</strong></p><p>On his return to England Cook was promoted to post captain on 9 August 1775 and appointed Fourth Captain of Greenwich Hospital, a retirement appointment he accepted with the proviso that it would not preclude him from being considered for further service. In March 1776 Cook was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society and at the same time awarded the Society's Copley medal for his work on scurvy. Early in 1776 Cook was coaxed out of retirement to command a further expedition to the Pacific in an attempt to find a northern passage by sea from the Pacific to the Atlantic Ocean. Once again he was appointed to the  <em>Resolution </em>with the newly purchased  <em>Discovery </em>, commanded by Charles Clerke, as consort.</p><p>Cook sailed from Plymouth on 12 July 1776, anchoring in Table Bay on 18 October, where he was joined by the  <em>Discovery </em>. On crossing the Indian Ocean, Cook carried out a running survey of the north coast of Kerguelen, establishing the island's longitude accurately with the aid of K1, which was once again carried on board the  <em>Resolution </em>. After brief stops in Adventure Bay in Tasmania and his old anchorage in Queen Charlotte Sound, adverse winds forced Cook to call at Tonga instead of making directly for Tahiti. Eventually reaching the Society Islands, Cook continued across the Pacific, making his first major 'discovery' on this voyage when Oahu and Kauai, at the western end of the Hawaiian Islands, were sighted on 18 January 1778. Next the north-west coast of North America was sighted on 7 March and for the next six and a half months Cook carried out a running survey of some 4,000 miles of its coast from Cape Blanco on the coast of Oregon to Icy Cape on the north coast of Alaska, where he was forced to turn back by an impenetrable wall of ice. A search for a route back to Europe north of Siberia also proved fruitless.</p><p>Cook decided to winter in the Hawaiian Islands, which he had named after his patron the Earl of Sandwich, before making a further attempt to find a northwest passage the following year. Cook anchored in Kealakekua Bay on the island of Hawaii on 17 January 1779. At first he was well received and by some accounts was considered by the Hawaiians as the embodiment of their God Lono. On 4 February 1779 Cook got under way to continue his survey of the islands but was forced to return to Kealakekua Bay for repairs after the  <em>Resolution </em>'s foremast was damaged in a violent storm. It soon became clear that his return was not welcome, culminating in the theft of the  <em>Discovery </em>'s cutter. On the morning of 14 February Cook landed with an escort of marines in an attempt, with less than his usual judgement, to persuade the local chief to return on board where he intended to hold him as a hostage against the return of the cutter. The chief readily agreed to accompany Cook, but at the landing place they were met by a hostile crowd and in the altercation that followed Cook and four of the marines were killed. Clerke, who now took command of the expedition, eventually managed to persuade the Hawaiians to return the majority of Cook's bones, which were put into a coffin and, on the afternoon of 21 February, were committed to the waters of Kealakekua Bay. Thus ended the life of Britain's greatest navigator and explorer.</p><p>There are numerous statues and monuments to Cook in many parts of the world, but the best memorial to him is the present-day map of the Pacific, which he did so much to shape.</p>",

He was educated at a grammar school in Esslingen, near Stuttgart. As a member of a Protestant youth organisation he had already shown a remarkable talent for leadership and a profound interest in reading and discussing the scriptures. After graduation he trained as an export merchant. Initially sympathizing with Hitler, he was soon disillusioned by the Nazis' hostile attitude towards religion and consequently joined the dissident branch of the Protestant church. During World War II he served as a corporal in the artillery and was seriously wounded. From 1947 to 1950 he worked as secretary for the YMCA in Pforzheim. In 1948 he broke away from the Protestant Church and started preaching the Gospel. His aggressive rhetoric and religious radicalism made a tremendous impact on his audience. Eventually, some 80 of his adherents formed a group which became known as the 'Cordier Circle.'</p><p>Around 1953 Cordier was determined to leave Germany with his followers and find a remote place where he could establish a rural community based on collective property and devoted to hard manual work, the reading of the Bible and the worship of God. He placed an advertisement in <em>The Times </em>, which put him in contact with the managing director of the FIC, who subsequently travelled to Pforzheim to sign on members of the sect for five years. On 3 August 1954 the first party of 12 Germans, including Cordier, his wife and four daughters, arrived at Goose Green to work on FIC farms. Later that year government approached him, through the FIC, about the recruitment of 25 German labourers to be engaged for a period of three years on the Stanley roads project and the water filtration and pumping scheme. Interested in bringing in more members of his sect, Cordier soon submitted a list of the required number of workmen. In July 1955 the road gang arrived at Stanley where they were accommodated in a place still called the German Camp. They proved an excellent workforce highly appreciated by government and Islanders.</p><p>Cordier had played a key role in the recruitment of contract labour from Germany in the 1950s, but relations with the authorities deteriorated following disputes over religious freedom. When he called on his men to quit specialist jobs and shepherding because they were contrary to the principles of his sect, the Germans at Goose Green stopped work on 27 November 1957 and moved to Stanley. Cordier, his family and three of the faithful left for Argentina early in 1958. The majority of the road gang extended their contracts for one year, after Government had offered some financial incentives. They departed on 28 August 1959 and rejoined their leader at Paso Flores (Río Negro), where the community eventually settled.</p><p>Guillermo Alfredo Cordier, as he had come to call himself in later years, died on 19 February 1982 in El Maiten (Chubut) Argentina.</p>",

        "body": " <p>government official, was born on 24 February 1843 at Longthorpe, Peterborough, son of Joshua and Alice Coulson. From the age of 14 years he had spent his life at sea. Although we do not know exactly when he arrived in the Falklands, he joined the Government mail schooner  <em>Foam </em>as second mate in February 1864. In 1866 his life changed following an incident whilst he was walking along Ross Road, Port Stanley. The new governor, William <a href=\"/biographies/robinson_sir\">ROBINSON</a>, was landing at Goss's Jetty when the pilot boat in which he was travelling capsized. The governor was wearing a heavy topcoat and was close to drowning when Coulson, who had seen the incident, dashed along the jetty and saved him. The governor rewarded Coulson with a monetary gift and an offer of employment in government service which he accepted. He started work as office keeper and messenger on 1 August 1867. It was his subsequent appointment as government clerk with direct responsibility for the mail which led to him being revered by Islanders, for ensuring that their mail was handled expeditiously, and by philatelists for whom there is a permanent reminder of his work in the intricate designs of patterns cut in corks for the cancellation of overseas mail. The people on West Falkland, in particular, had good reason to be thankful for the caring and dedicated service of William Coulson. There was then no post office on the West and it was a strict official requirement that mail had to be prestamped before delivery. He ensured that nothing was delayed, often paying for postage without reimbursement.</p><p>Coulson married Martha McGuire on 2 July 1866 in Port Stanley, an Ulsterwoman born on 1 July 1843. They had 2 daughters, Fanny (b1867), and Alice (b1869). Following Martha's death in 1871, William married Elizabeth Ann Hocking, a widow, on 23 April 1873 and they had seven children: William James (b1874), Ann Elizabeth (b1874), Frederick (b1877), Mary Alice (b1878), Henry Herbert (b1880), Charles Edward (b1881) and Samuel (b1883). Elizabeth died in September 1883 shortly after giving birth to Samuel who also died. In June 1875 Coulson leased Moody Valley Farm and entered into partnership with Charles <a href=\"/biographies/bender_christoph\">BENDER</a> who actually farmed the land. The partnership was terminated by the Supreme Court in 1890.</p><p>He was a caring father as well as being an outstanding civil servant. Following the death of Elizabeth the children were brought up by the Hockings at Cape Pembroke Lighthouse where James <a href=\"/biographies/hocking_james\">HOCKING</a> was the keeper for many years. It was during this period that Coulson's son Charles distinguished himself by his bravery in riding through the height of the storm to Stanley, a distance of seven miles, to alert the authorities that an American ship  <em>John R. Kelly </em>had been driven on to the rocks and was likely to founder. The steam launch  <em>Sissy </em>put to sea and after several hazardous attempts rescued the crew. The President of the United States ordered that presentations be made to the Captain of the <em>Sissy  </em>and his crew in recognition of their bravery. Charles appears to have been omitted from the awards although the American Consul wrote: 'I cannot exaggerate the conditions and the darkness caused by the wild storm. It was terrible and no reward is too much for this noble boy'. Charles made the journey in one and a half hours facing death through falling over the steep banks into the Bay or on to the rocks.</p><p>Coulson had been allocated living quarters in the Secretariat, an unprecedented concession, but the strain of an excessive work load and the constant attendance night and day on his sick son William took its toll. He had left his sick bed to attend his son's funeral and this hastened his own death on 21 August 1899. The  <em>Falkland Islands Magazine (FIMCP)  </em>wrote:</p><blockquote><blockquote>Mr. Coulson's death is deeply regretted by, one might say, the whole Islands; he had ever been most courteous and attentive to everyone who had anything to do in office; though his work was supposed to be more than equal that done by any two other Officials and his hours exceptionally long, yet he was ever ready to oblige the public even against the regulations which from time to time were issued with an eye more to the convenience of the Officials than that of the public.</blockquote></blockquote><p>They concluded the piece by declaring that the government would find it hard to fill his place. It is sad that at the age of 56 when he was looking forward to a well-earned pension he should die in the very week that two lady clerks were assigned to him to help during mail weeks. A public subscription was raised to erect a memorial to him in Stanley Cemetery.</p>",

He entered the navy in 1875 and three years later as midshipman of the  <em>Pallas </em>took part in the British occupation of Cyprus. In 1884, as a sub-lieutenant, he landed with the naval brigade for garrison duties in Upper Egypt and as first lieutenant of the  <em>Dolphin </em>served with the Eastern Sudan field force where he was chosen by the governor-general of the Red Sea province to act as his aide-de-camp. Cradock later served in the royal yacht from which he was promoted to commander. During the Boxer Rising in China on the  <em>Alacrity  </em>he commanded the naval brigade which led the Allied forces at the storming of the Taku Forts on 17 July 1900, serving with distinction. He subsequently directed Allied forces during the relief of Tientsin and, later, of Siku. Cradock's career went from strength to strength: he filled every appointment with great credit, he was single-minded, and as he never married the navy was his life. He wrote several books,  <em>Sporting Notes in the Far East  </em>in 1889,  <em>Wrinkles in Seamanship </em>in 1894 and in 1907, just after he was promoted to captain, he wrote  <em>Whispers from the Fleet </em>, a book for young officers who were starting out on their careers.</p><p>Cradock was promoted to rear-admiral in 1910 and created KCVO in 1912. He was appointed in February 1913 to command the North America and West Indies station and with the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, he was given responsibility for protecting the North American coast from the St Lawrence River to Brazil with his flag in the armoured cruiser  <em>Suffolk. </em>From October 1914 he was charged with the pursuit of von <a href=\"/biographies/spee_maximilian\">SPEE</a>'s East Asiatic Squadron which was moving across the Pacific with the Falkland Islands as a possible objective. Cradock hoisted his flag in the aged cruiser HMS  <em>Good Hope  </em>and arrived in Port Stanley in early October accompanied by three other warships. On 18 October he met Governor <a href=\"/biographies/allardyce_sir\">ALLARDYCE</a> at Government House to discuss the situation. Allardyce was worried that von Spee might try to occupy the Falklands as a base from which to harass shipping in the South Atlantic and realised that the German squadron was far stronger than Cradock's. Cradock was convinced that he would not survive the war and, as he left, told Allardyce that he would not see him again and asked if he could send his medals and decorations ashore for safe keeping, to be sent to his home after the war was over.</p><p>On 22 October the battleship  <em>Canopus </em>limped into Port Stanley, in need of repairs which would supposedly take about four days. Cradock decided he could not wait for her and left for the Pacific on 23 October with the  <em>Good Hope, Monmouth, Glasgow  </em>and <em>Otranto </em>. The two fleets met near the Chilean port of Coronel on the evening of 1 November and without the twelve-inch guns of  <em>Canopus, </em>Craddock's aged ships and under-trained crews were no match for the Germans.  <em>Good Hope </em>and  <em>Monmouth  </em>were sunk with all hands and the other two ships linked up with the trailing  <em>Canopus </em>and returned to the Falklands.</p><p>A service was held in Christ Church Cathedral, Stanley on 22 November 1914 and a memorial tablet was erected in the Cathedral paid for by donations from the offertories. A large memorial was erected in York Minster and unveiled in 1916 and there is another monument in the church of St Agatha, Gilling West, near the family home at Hartforth. No one has doubted Cradock's courage and, egged on by the Admiralty to find and confront von Spee, he would not flinch from the challenge. But it was a fatal mistake to leave his most powerful ship to follow and the tactical handling of his fleet during the battle of Coronel was poor. The kindest obituary comes in Allardyce's memoir of those eventful months: 'Cradock was an extremely nice man, one of nature's gentlemen. I saw a good deal of him and we became great friends ... He was an extraordinarily brave man ...'</p>",

In 1897 he became acting private secretary to the governor of the Falkland Islands and this post was followed by a variety of clerical and other jobs in the Secretariat and the Treasury. In 1903, the governor reporting a dispute between the colonial treasurer, (WA Thompson, a notoriously difficult man) and Craigie-Halkett, remarked that the latter was 'a good typist and a quick writer, but has little capacity for financial work, his strong points being riding and shooting.'

Her grandfather had an estate at Gdoff and it was there that her Scottish born father, who had just qualified as a doctor, stayed for a six month holiday with a Scottish family who had settled in Russia. He married their daughter, the mother of Frances, and stayed on. The family were forced to flee during World War I, shortly before the Revolution when Frances was only five. They crossed Lake Piepus and continued through Scandinavia to England, without her father who had enlisted in a Cossack regiment and was helping a member of the Tsar's family, Princess Leiven, to escape through Afghanistan (where he was rewarded with a gift of paintings).</p><p>The family settled in Canada, but returned to England when Frances's father died. The family had traditionally gone into the medical profession and while Frances's brother entered medical school, she herself trained as a nurse in St George's Hospital. She had always wanted to serve overseas and accepted a post as nursing sister at Stanley, arriving on the <em>Lafonia </em>on 22 August 1939. She quickly adapted to life in the Islands and, being an accomplished rider, often rode out to attend sick people.</p><p>The outbreak of war in September 1939 transformed her life. The hospital's matron was on leave in the UK and decided not to return as she believed she could make a greater contribution to the war effort elsewhere. In December 1939, the Battle of the River Plate resulted in extensive damage and many casualties to HMS <em>Exeter </em>and her crew and when the cruiser limped in to Stanley harbour, Frances Creece was the only state registered nurse there. She was appointed matron and quickly organised the hospital with temporary assistants and additional supplies. Some of the wounded had to be taken straight into surgery and Frances did not sleep for three nights. Her magnificent work was rewarded with an inscribed compact presented by Captain <a href=\"/biographies/bell_frederick\">BELL</a> of <em>Exeter </em>, which was later to save her life. Returning from leave in 1943 her ship was torpedoed and sunk and Frances spent five days in an open boat with other passengers and crew. A passing American plane was alerted by a crew member who borrowed the compact from Frances to make a signal.</p><p>In April 1943 Frances married Martin George Creece, office manager of the Falkland Islands Company.

He was educated at St Mary's Strawberry Hill teacher training college, London, and qualified as primary and secondary teacher in August 1946. From June 1945 to August 1947 he taught at St John Fisher School, Little Wymondley, Hitchin, Hertfordshire. On his departure from this school his headmaster, JF O'Regan, praised the young teacher for his genial and cheerful disposition and his willingness to tackle any job at any time. These were his characteristic traits and were to serve him well in the future.</p><p>At the age of twenty-seven, in February 1950, Cronin took up the post of Camp teacher at Goose Green, East Falkland. He fully participated in the activities of the Camp and taught in the settlements on both East and West Falkland until 1965. He was well known to the islanders as a gifted horse trainer and rider. In Mary CAWKELL's comprehensive account of the history and development of the Falkland Islands, Cronin is mentioned as having contributed to sightings of rare bird species visiting the Islands during the 1950s.</p><p>In 1965 Cronin took up appointment as teacher in Port Stanley Senior School. His special subject areas were English and mathematics, but he also had a great love of history. His pupils noted that he was a strict but fair teacher who commanded a real presence in the classroom. His vast experience of Camp and Stanley education resulted in his appointment in 1974 as acting headmaster to the Stanley schools. D'Earle <a href=\"/biographies/draycott_dearle\">DRAYCOTT</a>, superintendent of education, praised Cronin for being instrumental in implementing the Bell recommendations in education.

In April 1982 he was interviewed by Irish radio on life in the Falkland Islands. He commented that Islanders prized above all a man's ability to 'ride a horse, to shear a sheep, to plait a lasso and to sail a boat'. He predicted a short conflict and Argentine surrender, even as the British Task Force sailed south. Cronin died of emphysema in Cork University Hospital on 23 July 1998.

        "body": "<p>explorer, was born in Banbridge, Co Down, in September 1796. He was the fifth son of George Crozier, attorney-at-law, and Jane, née Graham. Crozier entered the navy in June 1810, joining the frigate <em>Hamadryad </em>. In June 1812 he joined <em>Briton  </em>in the Channel Fleet for a time, then - during the brief war with the United States - went to the Pacific in quest of the USS <em>Essex;  </em>while there they found the descendants of the mutineers of the <em>Bounty,  </em>and one of the actual mutineers, living on Pitcairn Island.</p><p>In February 1816 Crozier joined <em>Maeander,  </em>which was refitting in the Thames. Then followed fifteen months in the <em>Queen Charlotte,  </em>and April 1818 found him on board the sloop <em>Doterel  </em>employed on the St Helena and Irish stations. In January 1821 he volunteered for the Arctic expedition fitting out under Commander WE Parry, for a further search for the North West Passage, joining the <em>Fury,  </em>bomb vessel*, in March. They spent two winters in the Arctic carrying out scientific observations and forming a close relationship with a tribe of Eskimos. In January 1824 he was appointed to the <em>Hecla,  </em>bomb vessel, again under Parry, for a similar expedition. They spent one winter in the Arctic, but the loss of their sister ship, the <em>Fury,  </em>and unfavourable ice conditions, led to their early return to England. In March 1826 Crozier was promoted to lieutenant. Some months later he rejoined the <em>Hecla,  </em>once more under Parry. The object of this next expedition was that a party should attempt to make their way on foot across the ice from Spitzbergen to the North Pole. Crozier remained with the ship making a series of astronomical and magnetic observations. In May 1827 he had been elected Fellow of the Astronomical Society.</p><p>An appointment to the new frigate, <em>Stag,  </em>came in April 1831. They were employed mainly in Portuguese waters, but there were brief periods on the Home station, and a short visit to West Africa. In December 1835 he volunteered to accompany his old messmate James Clark <a href=\"/biographies/ross_sir\">ROSS</a>, in the whale ship <em>Cove  </em>in the capacity of first lieutenant, on a potentially hazardous mission in search of some missing whalers who had been caught in the ice in Davis Strait. For his services in this expedition he was promoted to commander in January 1837.</p><p>From May 1839 until September 1843 Crozier was employed in command of the <em>Terror,  </em>bomb vessel, again under Ross, in a voyage to the Antarctic for the purposes of magnetic research and geographical discovery. They circumnavigated the continent, and made three attempts to approach it, but on each occasion were unable to land on the mainland. In 1842 the ships wintered at the Falkland Islands; the opportunity was taken to repair the damage they had sustained in an earlier collision, and to refit them generally. The day of their arrival proved to be a memorable one for Crozier. When they anchored in Berkeley Sound on a blowing dirty afternoon there was much disappointment on board as no mail had arrived for them; however, Governor <a href=\"/biographies/moody_richard\">MOODY</a> had very kindly sent off a recent copy of the <em>Navy List  </em>which showed that Crozier had received the all-important promotion to post captain; this was the result of a very strong recommendation from Ross. One useful thing Ross and Crozier did during their stay was to assess the relative merits of Ports Louis and William for chief port of the colony; they reported in favour of the latter. Otherwise their routine was to live on shore at the newly-erected observatory from Monday morning to Saturday night making observations, returning on board on Sundays to relax and conduct divine service, as no readings were taken on that day. At this time Crozier was unfortunate enough to lose the services of his first lieutenant, Archibald McMurdo, through invaliding; he was the only officer in the ship with previous experience in ice navigation. One of the mates, TEL <a href=\"/biographies/moore_thomas\">MOORE</a>, was destined to return to the Islands as governor in 1855. During the expedition Crozier had been making a collection of bird skins from Porto Praia, the Kerguelen Isles, Tasmania, New Zealand, the Auckland Isles, Campbell Island, Cape Horn and many places within the Antarctic Circle. Now specimens from the Falklands were added, and the whole, comprising nearly 150 species, was packed up and sent off to the Belfast Museum. At the end of the commission Crozier returned to Ireland. He was elected Fellow of the Royal Society in December 1843.</p><p>In March 1845 he was again appointed to the <em>Terror  </em>for yet another attempt to find the North West Passage led by Sir John Franklin. The ships were last seen by a whaler in Baffin Bay in July, then totally vanished. By the end of 1847 concern for their safety began to mount at home, and, over the next few years a number of search expeditions, both official and private, were dispatched to the Arctic, but no trace of the missing explorers could be found. Eventually, in 1854, Dr John Rae, of the Hudson Bay Company, recovered some crested silver and other relics of the expedition from the Eskimos which gave a strong clue as to the particular area where the tragedy had occurred. In 1859 a private expedition sent out by Lady Franklin, under the command of Captain FLMcClintock, recovered the record left by the crews on King William Island after they had abandoned the ships in April 1848. It disclosed that Sir John Franklin had died in June 1847, thereby placing Crozier in overall command, and that they intended making their way home overland. None appear to have succeeded in getting further than the extreme northern edge of the North American continent. However, in doing so, they completed the missing link in the North West Passage via that particular route.</p><p>Crozier is remembered in Stanley by Crozier Place at the eastern end of Ross Road.</p>",

After a curacy in Godalming (Surrey) he answered the missionary call and went out with the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel to southern Africa where his work culminated from 1971-1975 as Dean of the Anglican cathedral in Salisbury, Rhodesia {Harare, Zimbabwe}.</p><p>In 1975 Dean Cutts was the first person to be elected by a diocesan synod to become bishop of the diocese which then covered most of Argentina and Uruguay and is now known as the Diocese of Argentina. He was also involved in the formation of a new Anglican Province of the Southern Cone of America to unite all dioceses in that part of the continent. Bishop Cutts, as the commissary* of the Archbishop of Canterbury, used to visit the Falkland Islands once or twice a year, or send one of his clergy.</p><p>The inauguration of this new Province had to be postponed after the invasion of the Falkland Islands on 2 April 1982. In fact the Anglican Falkland Islanders had already rejected the proposal to include them in the jurisdiction of the new Province and Archbishop Donald Coggan had agreed to offer them extra-provincial status with pastoral visits from the bishop with the closest geographical and historical links to the Islands (which had always been the bishop in Buenos Aires).</p><p>On the day of the invasion Cutts (after talking to Harry <a href=\"/biographies/bagnall_harry\">BAGNALL</a>, the chaplain in Stanley) petitioned the military government of General Galtieri to allow him to visit the Islands on his own. This permission was not granted for about two weeks, when the government agreed to allow him to lead a group of Anglo-Argentines, as others were also asking to go. However Cutts had never intended to go with others and he knew that, by then, it was too late and that nothing would be achieved.

Dale married Mary Astley on 21 September 1825 and they had two children, Sarah Isabel Dale and William <a href=\"/biographies/dale_william\">DALE</a>. His wife died in May 1832 and Dale then married a widow, Martha Seacombe Lafone (sister of Samuel F <a href=\"/biographies/lafone_samuel\">LAFONE)</a>. In 1834 Lafone invited Dale to come out to Montevideo and manage a salting plant ( <em>saladero) </em>, which he had established at Cerro de Montevideo. Dale, accompanied by his family settled in Montevideo and though the  <em>saladero </em>was closed during the siege of the city, he obtained a post as British pro-consul. At the end of the siege, he was appointed the first colonial manager of the new Falkland Islands Company. On 1 July 1852, Dale, with his family, arrived in the Islands on board the FIC mail schooner  <em>Amelia  </em>from Liverpool, together with a shepherd, several artisans and their families. On board were also 46 Cheviot sheep and merchandise for sale in the Islands. The FIC directors later dispatched the barque  <em>Record </em>to the Islands (arriving 28 September 1852), sending out a storekeeper, shepherds, artisans, and their families, more goods for sale, sheep, a Galloway bull and sheep dogs, and building materials for the construction of houses and a store.</p><p>Dale had been given a detailed plan to guide him as he began the business of the FIC, much of which was poorly resourced by the directors in London. He arrived in the middle of a severe winter, with nowhere to store the goods the directors had sent out for sale, and very inadequate accommodation for himself and family. He found he was setting up in competition with the already established and financially strong business of JM <a href=\"/biographies/dean_john1\">DEAN</a> &amp; Sons. The winter of 1852 took a heavy toll of the sheep and cattle on Lafonia. Many cattle had died or were too emaciated to be worth slaughtering. Scab* was endemic among the sheep. Dale was unable to compete with Dean in the business of buying wrecks or hulks and their cargoes. However, by the onset of winter 1853 Dale had been active in organising the culling of the wild cattle for their hides, and the subsequent restocking of the camp. The buildings that had been sent out from England were erected, and the shepherds and artisans were working well. Unfortunately, the site he chose for the FIC General Store was poorly located. Dale employed his son William as Camp manager until his dismissal; William subsequently resigned the post.</p><p>A nephew of one of the directors, Emanuel Boutcher, visited the Islands in 1853. On his return to London, he reported that, in his view, Dale was managing incompetently, his bookkeeping was unsatisfactory, and he should be dismissed. This recommendation was acted on late that year.</p><p>Claiming that the FIC still owed him £600, Dale and his family stayed in Stanley for some time, at first continuing to live in the colonial manager's house, even after June 1854 when his successor, Thomas <a href=\"/biographies/havers_thomas\">HAVERS</a>, with his family, had arrived. Dale and his wife lived for some further years in Montevideo, until a friend left him a farm in Cheshire. The sale of this property enabled the Dales to retire in comfort at Torquay where he died on 27 April 1867. Martha died, aged 93, in 1896.</p>",

He was educated in England and Germany and accompanied his father and stepmother (Martha Seacombe Dale) when the former took up the post of FIC Colonial Manager in Stanley in 1852. His father appointed him Camp manager.</p><p>He resigned his duties on the dismissal of his father at the end of 1853. It seems that the Dale family remained some time in Stanley before leaving for England. First his parents left, and then, according to a letter he wrote to María Lafone, William was due to follow at the end of July 1855, on board the  <em>Birmingham </em>bound for Cork. William married his stepmother's sister, Harriet Jane Lafone (c.1809-83), whose brother was Samuel F <a href=\"/biographies/lafone_samuel\">LAFONE</a>, on 15 November 1855, in the Church of St Mary the Virgin, West Derby, Liverpool, where Harriet was still living in her widowed father's home. She was baptised the day before the wedding. The witnesses at the marriage included Alexander <a href=\"/biographies/lafone_samuel\">LAFONE</a> and his wife Emily.</p><p>At some time afterwards, William returned to Uruguay with Harriet, where he built his own house and continued to farm. Dale died in Buenos Aires, aged 42, and was buried in the Victoria Cemetery on 18 November 1870. The cause of death is stated in the burial register as cancer. There is a strong family tradition that he died as a consequence of complications following a fall while drinking  <em>mate </em>, <em> </em>and the metal straw ( <em>bombilla </em>) which he was using penetrating the back of his throat. Harriet returned to England and lived at Sale, Cheshire, until her death in 1883. There were no children of the marriage.</p><p>William Dale was a talented watercolourist. His paintings, dating from the years when he lived in the Falklands, are contained in a sketchbook which is still in family hands. The watercolours show country scenes, gauchos, cattle, corrals and huts and are a unique record of life in the Falklands Camp in the 1850s. Several were reproduced in Joan Spruce's  <em>Corrals and Gauchos  </em>and others (unattributed) appear in R L Molinari's  <em>Biografía de la Pampa, </em>Buenos Aires 1987.</p>",

        "body": "<p>governor, was born in 1818, the eldest son of Colonel Joseph D'Arcy, Royal Artillery, and Lady Catherine West, daughter of Earl De La Warr. The name of Abbas Kooli was given to him because his father had trained an artillery corps for the Shah of Persia. The Shah Abbas Khan requested Colonel D'Arcy on parting: 'When you have a son, name him after me'. Joseph D'Arcy fulfilled the request but, being a modest man, he named his child Abbas Kooli, not wishing to take the title Shah as well as his name. Whereas 'Khan' signifies Highness, 'Kooli' means ordinary. Their mother having died when George was three, he and his younger brother, Robert were sent to boarding school in England.</p><p>On leaving Sandhurst in 1837, D'Arcy was appointed to the 94th Regiment in Ireland as an ensign and served for two years as adjutant; he then went on to India with his regiment where he served for twelve years as Aide de Camp to five successive governors. He was gazetted major in the 3rd West India Regiment and appointed to command the troops at Nassau, Bahamas, eventually being promoted lieutenant-colonel in command of the regiment at Jamaica and retiring in 1858.</p><p>In 1859 D'Arcy was appointed governor of the disease-ridden dependency of the Gambia River on the west coast of Africa where he remained for seven years doing great works, building roads, draining swamps, rescuing refugees from the tribal wars and was finally involved in fierce fighting to protect the colony from invading tribes. He returned to England in 1867 and in March 1870 was appointed governor of the Falkland Islands.</p><p>At the time of his arrival in Stanley the farmers on the then newly settled West Falkland were in a state of collapse, facing bankruptcy, having spent their capital on the purchase of stock, buildings, drainage and fencing. Without waiting for approval from London, D'Arcy put into effect ordinance No 6 of 1870, extending settlers' leases on both islands from ten to twenty-one years, reducing the rental from 10 shillings to 6 shillings an acre for the first ten years and the purchase price from 8 shillings to 2 shillings an acre. When the Colonial Office heard of it, the ordinance was disallowed and D'Arcy was told that under no circumstances could land be sold for less than 4 shillings an acre. Meanwhile he had sold 800,000 acres at 2 shillings an acre. In 1871, however, a new ordinance was passed, reducing the price of land to 4 shillings an acre but embodying all the other benefits of the disallowed Ordinance.</p><p>The ten years extension gave the struggling farmers on West Falkland a new lease of life and renewed energy: instead of giving up, some found new partners with capital to join them, others worked on alone. As a result, by the mid 1870s sheep farming was not only well established but prospering. So much so that in 1877 the farmers on West Falkland were able to charter ships to bring out stores and take home their wool clip without calling at Stanley.</p><p>In 1872, D'Arcy introduced a mail service between Port Stanley and West Falkland. Mail was taken by horse to Port Sussex on Falkland Sound, then across to Port Howard on West Falkland by schooner, using first the government schooner <em>Foam </em>and then the Falkland Islands Company's schooner <em>Black Hawk </em>. Finally the mail was delivered by horse to the various farm settlements. For the settlers of West Falkland this was of great benefit as previously letters had been taking as long as four months to reach them after arrival at Stanley.</p><p>Two new roads were completed: one to the signal station at the back of Stanley and another from Stanley to Darwin. Stanley Cemetery was fenced in, the governor personally presenting two wrought iron gates for the entrance. Street lighting was first introduced in Stanley and the gaol was completed, as were a bonded warehouse, a new reservoir and a quarantine station.</p><p>His wife Caroline was an enthusiastic Catholic and incurred the wrath of the colonial chaplain, the Rev <a href=\"/biographies/lory_henry\">LORY</a>, for her missionary activity. D'Arcy himself was hospitable to the first Catholic priests to visit during British rule, Father <a href=\"/biographies/walsh_william\">WALSH</a> and Father FORAN.</p><p>As might be expected, Governor D'Arcy was very popular with Islanders, especially with the sheep farmers of West Falkland and, in 1876, when he was due to end his tour of duty, the colonists addressed a petition to Lord Carnarvon, secretary of state for the colonies, asking that he might serve another term:</p><blockquote><blockquote>We, the undersigned sheep-farmers and other inhabitants of the Falkland Islands, beg to humbly request your Lordship to advise Her Most Gracious Majesty to continue our present Governor, the Honourable Colonel D'Arcy, in his office for such another usual term of service... We consider the Governor's past rule marked in most matters by wisdom, and invariably by an earnest desire to do impartial justice, and to ameliorate the condition of all the Queen's subjects in his charge, more particularly of the humbler classes, those most needing his protection. His power and influence have been especially concentrated in an effort to build up and strengthen a respectable middle class, and it has met with considerable success.</blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>We the undersigned sheep-farmers in particular, have great cause to be grateful to him and his predecessor in office, who initiated the present system of pastoral leases ...The sheep industry of the Colony, its most important and probably its only possible one, had been neglected, indeed discouraged, for upwards of thirty years; but the land, which had lain idle from the day of Creation until recently, will now in a few years be covered with thousands of sheep, which will add a very substantial and important item to the wealth of the Empire.</blockquote></blockquote><p>The petition was not to succeed, however, as by the time it was sent the new governor, TF <a href=\"/biographies/callaghan_jeremiah\">CALLAGHAN</a>, was already on his way. A memorial was later presented to D'Arcy signed by 130 people of Stanley, 'representing the working classes' of the Falkland Islands, extolling his virtues especially as the 'saviour' of West Falkland and praising him and his wife, Caroline, for all their good works.</p><p>The Colonial Office were less impressed with D'Arcy's talents as governor: his despatches were read with amusement and he was described as 'not a man of business'. Some years later an official minuted: 'we have had a very inefficient governor in this distant possession. He is an old man quite broken down and so now [1878] almost incapable. He carried on the government with the assistance of advances from merchants and others, on which he did not inform the Secretary of State'.</p><p>A small pension was granted and D'Arcy retired to Penzance in Cornwall. Once the Islands became financially self-supporting, he wrote to ask the Colonial Office whether he could be re-imbursed some of the expenses he had incurred as governor. After a long and painful illness, he died on 22 October 1885. The Colonial Office eventually gave his widow a small annuity. Two prominent hills on West Falkland are called after him and his wife: Mount D'Arcy and Mount Caroline.</p>",

        "body": "<p>scientist, was born in Shrewsbury on 9 February 1809, the son of Robert Darwin, a fashionable and prosperous doctor, and Susannah Darwin, née Wedgwood. He was the grandson of Erasmus Darwin - physician, poet, philosopher, polymath, who espoused evolutionary concepts long before his grandson developed the integrated theory of evolution through natural selection. The family tended towards nonconformity and the Whig tradition in politics. Charles's mother died when he was eight and in later life he said he had little recollection of her. His father, besides being an eminent physician must have had a dominating presence; he was 6ft2in (1·88m) in height, and at one stage weighed over 24 stone (150kg). The young Charles was extremely fond of him, and later wrote that he was the kindest man he ever knew. However, Dr Darwin's attempts to influence the direction of his son's career led, from time to time, to a certain amount of conflict.</p><p>After a year at a small school, the young Darwin went to Shrewsbury School. He did not perform well academically, and left the school, not altogether unwillingly, at the age of 16. Thereafter, for a few months in the summer of 1825 he served as a sort of apprentice to his doctor father, helping with patients and the preparation of medicines, before he was dispatched to Edinburgh Medical School, where his elder brother Erasmus was completing his training. Darwin detested the medical training: but he attended a few (rather unexciting) lectures on geology and made contact with the freethinking Dr Robert Grant, a comparative anatomist and specialist in the zoology of marine life, and enjoyed beachcombing along the coast of the Firth of Forth looking for seashore life. The sight of operations (performed in those days without anaesthetic) appalled him, and after two years he left Edinburgh unqualified. His father was disappointed. It was decided that although it was rather outside family tradition, he might make a Church of England parson; he was therefore sent to Christ's College Cambridge to take a general degree in Arts. There a modicum of theology, philosophy, mathematics and New Testament Greek was studied, good food eaten, wine consumed and friends made. He went beetle-collecting with his cousin, William Darwin Fox. Particularly important influences at Cambridge were his friendships with the young don, the Reverend John Stevens Henslow, Professor of Botany, with whom he used to go for walks into the Cambridgeshire countryside, and with the Reverend Adam Sedgwick, Professor of Geology. Both encouraged his interest in natural history. In 1831 Darwin graduated as Bachelor of Arts and that summer Sedgwick took him on a geological expedition through North Wales.</p><p>Darwin used, in his explorations during the  <em>Beagle </em>voyage, almost every aspect of what he had learned from Sedgwick, and what he had taught himself that summer, in the Welsh borders and North Wales. These included the direct transect line across country, the inspection of sections and exposures, the marking of stratification on a map, the collection of rock specimens, the use of clinometer (an instrument for measuring the dip of strata) and compass. Darwin regretted his 'incapacity to draw', and certainly some of his geological cross-section drawings and sketch-maps are a little crude. They are, however, sufficient, and it is quite clear that he had the knack of 'making out the geology of a country' in three dimensions. He had good cause to write to Henslow on 11 April 1833, just after he had left the Falklands, asking him to tell Professor Sedgwick that he had 'never ceased to be thankful for that short tour in Wales'.</p><p><strong>Voyage of the Beagle</strong></p><p>Darwin returned to Shrewsbury from the Welsh excursion to find a letter from Henslow awaiting him suggesting that he might be interested in accompanying Captain <a href=\"/biographies/fitzroy_robert\">FITZROY</a> on the  <em>Beagle  </em>voyage as a 'supernumerary'. His father initially was not in favour, but with the help of friends (particularly his uncle, Josiah Wedgwood), Darwin managed to persuade him. An interview with the commander of the expedition, Captain Robert FitzRoy, in London followed. The next few months were spent in a frantic round of collecting equipment and materials for the voyage, and obtaining instruction in the best methods of preparing specimens. For the last few weeks before the ship departed, the enthusiastic Charles was in residence at Plymouth, where the <em>Beagle  </em>lay, supervising the loading of his supplies. There were delays due to poor weather, and other difficulties, and indeed a couple of false starts, but on 27 December 1831 the  <em>Beagle </em>departed on her voyage around the world.</p><p>From Devonport the ship proceeded, after a brief hesitation at Tenerife, to the Cape Verde Islands, off the African Coast (January 1832), and thence to St Paul's Rocks and Fernando Noronha, tiny islets in the South Atlantic (February 1832). At these, and at many other islands and ports visited, Captain FitzRoy's task was to establish their position very precisely: he was charged by the Admiralty of 'establishing a chain of meridians around the world'. He had over 20 chronometers to assist him to determine longitude accurately. From St Paul's and Fernando Noronha the  <em>Beagle </em>proceeded to the mainland of South America, where the main programme of hydrographic survey commenced. A detailed survey of Tierra del Fuego followed. The visits to the Falklands alternated with the visits to Tierra del Fuego. Eventually, in mid-1834 the Magellan Strait, between Tierra del Fuego and the South American mainland, was traversed, and the expedition set out northwards, to the Island of Chiloé, and the scattering of islets that constitute the Chonos Archipelago to its south. Surveys along the coast of Chile and Peru allowed Darwin the opportunity of making a number of excursions inland in South America. In September 1835 the  <em>Beagle  </em>set out across the Pacific, calling first, as is well known, at the Galapagos Islands (September-October 1835), which Darwin did not particularly like. Then followed the longest leg of the entire voyage, to Tahiti (November 1835). Tahiti, especially the missionaries working there, left positive images in his mind, and he was sorry to leave. New Zealand (Christmas 1835), where again Darwin was impressed by the work of missionaries, he liked less. Mainland Australia, with its brashness, the convict presence, and the dry, stark landscape, was not a great deal to be favoured, although some of the observations he made there were important (eg in New South Wales, January 1836; King George's Sound, March): he much preferred green, mild Tasmania (February 1836).</p><p>From Australia, perhaps because of some change of plans at a late stage, FitzRoy decided to go to the Cocos (Keeling) Islands in the Indian Ocean; he had been instructed to 'fix their position' if possible (April 1836). Darwin enjoyed his time there as much as he had disliked New South Wales and Western Australia: observations at this atoll were also very important to him in the development of his 'theory of coral reefs'. A short visit to Mauritius was followed by a brief sojourn at the Cape of Good Hope.</p><p>Back in the Atlantic, there were visits to St Helena and Ascension (July 1836), and then to complete the chain of meridians, Bahia in Brazil was visited once again (August). Another return visit, to the Cape Verde Islands, was followed by a few days in the Azores (September 1836) before Falmouth in Cornwall was gained on 2 October 1836.</p><p>Almost all the scientific enterprises in which Darwin was later engaged can be traced to his days on the  <em>Beagle </em>, and an important part of his inspiration came from his explorations of remote islands. 'The habit of comparison leads to generalisation', he wrote towards the end of his voyage. Darwin visited many islands in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans; tropical, arid, temperate and sub-Antarctic; large (Australia, New Zealand, Tasmania) and tiny (St Paul's Rocks, Cocos) and was constantly comparing them - their geology, natural history and human inhabitants.</p><p><strong>Darwin and the Falklands</strong></p><p>Darwin made two visits to the Falkland Islands (1 March - 6 April 1833 and 9 March - 7 April 1834) during the second voyage of the <em>Beagle  </em>and there are grounds for believing that his visits were of considerable significance in the development of his ideas. He explored a good deal of East Falkland (he probably did not land on West Falkland, although others from the expedition did, and provided him with information). He beachcombed along the shores of Berkeley Sound, explored well to the north and to the south of Port Louis, and rode across East Falkland with a group of gauchos to a bay named Darwin's Harbour after him. His experiences on East Falkland, where he spent more time than at many of his ports of call, and covered dozens of pages with his notes, were in some respects pivotal. A few examples must suffice. He had with him Lyell's  <em>Principles of Geology </em>which espoused a 'gradualist' or 'uniformitarian' view of the world's development, rather than a 'catastrophist' (sudden dramatic change) interpretation then widely accepted. On East Falkland Darwin was betwixt and between the two extremes: he observed the processes of gradual erosion and deposition, but also (in the privacy of his own notes) speculated that the stone-runs might have been created by earthquakes shaking rock masses from the nearby mountains! He noted that the foxes (or warrahs) from East and West Falkland were different, long before he made comparable observation on the birds of the Galapagos. He did not describe the kelp-beds of Berkeley Sound as 'ecosystems' but described the tight network of relationships of the organisms within them in a remarkably integrated way. The folded strata of the islands confirmed in his mind that he lived in a dynamic, changing world. He compared the barren moorlands of the East Falkland with the richness of the warm shallow seas of the Palaeozoic, evidence of which he found in fossiliferous strata near Port Louis, understanding, therefore that the climate and environment must have changed. He described the  <em>behaviour </em>of birds (penguins, caracaras) at a time when morphology and appearance were considered more important, opening the way for his later psychological studies (eg his <em>The Expression of Emotions in Animals and Man </em>). He noted that some invertebrate forms he found in Berkeley Sound produced tens of thousands of eggs, and yet were not numerous - just a step away the ideas of competition and natural selection expressed in  <em>On the Origin of Species </em>. He observed the appearance and behaviour of the feral cattle and horses: one of his entry points to evolutionary ideas, much later, was through the study of domestic animals ( <em>Animals and Plants under Domestication </em>). He wondered about the mechanisms of dispersal of plants and animals to the islands, noticing that some of the forms found on the Falklands were similar to those of South America. It would not be true to say that Darwin's Falklands experiences were <em>all-important </em>, any more than his Galapagos experiences were of overwhelming significance. But the Falklands sojourn, along with his visits to so many other islands, provided important opportunities for him, some of them unique.</p><p>After his return from the voyage, Charles Darwin spent a frantic few years, mainly in London and Cambridge, sorting his specimens, writing up his material for publication, and discussing his observations with 'the leading scientific men' of the day. He edited his diary for publication - it later became known as  <em>The Voyage of the Beagle </em>. It was probably during this period (despite occasional glimmerings during the voyage) that he was 'converted' to an evolutionary outlook. A date of March 1837 has been suggested.</p><p><strong>Later Life - On the Origin of Species</strong></p><p>The young lady of whom he was fond in pre- <em>Beagle </em>days (Fanny Owen) had married someone else during the first few months he was away, and a little over two years after his return (on 29 January 1839) he married his cousin Emma Wedgwood (1808-1896). The Darwins married their Wedgwood cousins three times in two generations, and at times Darwin was haunted by the idea that this might have unfortunate effects; three of his ten children died in infancy, although several of the others had long and distinguished lives. After a brief period of residence in London they moved to Down House, Downe, in Kent, in September 1842, where apart from short visits to other parts of Britain, Darwin spent the rest of his days. He was comfortably off, particularly after the death of his father, and did not have to seek paid employment, but was able to devote his life, in the quiet of the Kent countryside, to science while living the life of a country squire.</p><p>Around the time of his marriage Darwin read Thomas Malthus's  <em>Essay on Population </em>. This provided the mechanism for the evolutionary ideas with which he was experimenting (he tended to use the term 'transmutability of species'). He wrote short drafts of his idea in the 1840s, but although one can see the occasional evolutionary insight in some of his publications of those days, he did not publish his full theory. Possibly he felt he needed to accumulate overwhelming evidence, possibly it was out of a feeling for his wife's religious susceptibilities - she was a devout woman. However, in the (northern) summer of 1858 he received a letter from Alfred Russel Wallace enclosing the draft of an article that outlined similar theories to his own. An honourable man, he did not wish to be unfair to a colleague, but neither did he think it right that someone else should have priority in a matter upon which he had been working for over 20 years. His friends and colleagues, Charles Lyell and Joseph <a href=\"/biographies/hooker_sir\">HOOKER</a> took matters in hand, and presented a cobbled-together version of material from both Wallace and Darwin to the Linnean Society of London on 1 July 1858.  <em>On the Origin of Species </em>followed a year later.</p><p>Darwin had periods of illness for much of his life, and led a somewhat retiring life at Downe; he did not attend the Linnean Society meeting, nor the 'Great Debate' on his ideas at the British Association meeting in 1860. Although much criticised (and misquoted and misinterpreted), he took the criticism with a quiet grace. He published a stream of books and scientific papers, both before and after the publication of the  <em>Origin </em>, on a wide range of scientific subjects.</p><p>Darwin applied the 'gradualist' notion to the development of coral reefs while aboard the  <em>Beagle </em>: he postulated that fringing reef, barrier reefs and atolls were members of a series, one form developing into another as islands sank or (as is now suggested) sea levels rose. He later applied gradualist concepts to the psychological development of children, the development of different types of igneous rocks from a single magma, and of course, to the development of life on earth.</p><p>Darwin died, after a period of illness, on 19 April 1882; a quiet funeral in the local parish church had been planned, but the scientific establishment took over, and although he might be described as an agnostic, he was buried in Westminster Abbey after a service of considerable pomp on 26 April.</p><p>Charles Darwin has claims to be one of the most influential thinkers of all time. A somewhat retiring Victorian naturalist, his influence on science, philosophy, politics, religion and literature - in short on the way in which humanity thought about itself in relation to the universe - was incalculable. It would be fair to say that Darwin's hypotheses changed the world; they were of course an incomplete expression of evolution ideas - genetics and molecular biology have carried them further than he could have envisaged. Sometimes they have been distorted (in social Darwinism and Nazism, for example) in ways of which he would not have approved. Some still disagree with his essential thrust, but few can deny his importance. In the development of his amazing intellect, his two month-long sojourns in the Falkland Islands in the southern hemisphere autumns of 1833 and 1834 had a significant role. His memory is maintained in place-names in the Falkland Islands (Darwin, originally 'Darwin's Harbour', by Goose Green), South America, Australia and New Zealand, and in the scientific names of many species of plants and animals.</p>",

        "body": " <p>visiting grassland expert, was born in London on 20 March 1899 the son of William and Margaret Davies. He was educated at the Sloane School London, and at the University College of Aberystwyth and served for six months in the army before returning to university where he gained a first class degree in Agriculture and Botany in 1923. He was later awarded the degrees of MSc and DSc for his research work in grassland science. Davies married Alice Lewis (also a botany graduate from the University College of Aberystwyth and always addressed by him as Lal) on 3 November 1928. They had one son, David. On graduation Davies worked in the Welsh Plant Breeding Station at Aberystwyth and in 1929 he was appointed chief research officer for grasslands by the Empire Marketing Board. He departed on his honeymoon in January 1929 for New Zealand and spent five years there and one in Australia.</p><p>On 20 November 1937 Davies arrived in the Falklands in the SS <em>Lafonia </em>, at the invitation of Governor <a href=\"/biographies/henniker_heaton\">HENNIKER HEATON</a>, and with the support of some of the farm managers. He travelled extensively, visiting almost all the farms, making a comprehensive survey of the grasslands of the Falkland Islands and he conducted re-seeding and fertilisation experiments. Davies worked with David Weir the highly capable government stock inspector seconded from the New Zealand Department of Agriculture, for three years.</p><p>Davies's subsequent report was primarily concerned with the improvement of grassland pasturage, and although it did not contain as much animal husbandry advice as <a href=\"/biographies/munro_hugh\">MUNRO</a>'s Report of 1924 Davies reiterates many of his conclusions and recommendations. Davies stated the problem succinctly; the decline in the number of sheep carried and the decline in wool production. There are two key recommendations in the Davies Report:</p><p>Davies challenged directly the open range, large scale ranching basis on which the Islands farming industry had been based since its inception. He argued not for overstocking but for large flocks on smaller, subdivided Camps, with frequent movement of sheep to new Camps. Davies' conclusions are stark:</p><blockquote><blockquote>The time has arrived when the Falklands must consider very seriously whether the present ranching policy is to continue, or whether a complete change of methods involving a policy of grassland improvement together with a more intensive system of pastoral agriculture is to be put into effect. Continuance of the existing ranching system cannot but lead to a still greater lowering of carrying capacity, and to the decreased wealth of the country as a whole. With a change over in methods and the gradual substitution of a more intensive type of grassland farming the decline in production would cease ... sub-division of paddocks, the better management of pastures, and the replacement of the present herbage by better plants are all essentials in the developmental scheme.</blockquote></blockquote><p>Davies' 'root and branch' criticism of Islands farming initially received a very mixed response - some of it distinctly hostile. Governor Henniker-Heaton made little secret of his support and, with his encouragement, the Department of Agriculture attempted to implement some of Davies' recommendations in a modest way in the vicinity of Stanley, after Davies left the Falkland Islands.</p><p>Davies wrote the majority of his Report before he left the Falkland Islands, but the printed version  <em>The Grasslands of the Falkland Islands </em>(HMSO 1939) did not reach the Islands until mid-1939. The Report was distributed to all sheep farmers and managers, but the Governor lamented that 'it received no acknowledgement from any of the large [land] holders'.</p><p>Davies gave a public lecture in the Old Town Hall on 5 March 1938 and left Stanley in SS <em>Fitzroy </em>on 12 March 1938 for Punta Arenas. He then began a tour of farms in Chile and Argentina, and submitted a report on both countries to the British government. On his return Davies resumed work on his monumental survey of all the grasslands of England and Wales - the first time that such a large-scale survey had been attempted. He was deputy director of the new Grassland Improvement Station at Dodwell Farm, Stratford-on-Avon, and became director in 1945. Grassland research was transferred to a new Institute at Hurley, in Berkshire, in 1949, and Davies remained as director until his retirement in 1966. He was created a CBE in 1964. He dedicated his life completely to research and he worked tirelessly for international cooperation in his field. Davies always felt at home in the company of farmers, and believed that rigorous scientific research must have practical application to work on the land. His knowledge of world grasslands was unrivalled.</p><p>Davies died on 31 July 1968, and his wife, Alice, in February 1999.</p>",

        "body": "<p>English mariner and writer on navigation, was born and bred in Devon at Sandridge in the parish of Stoke Gabriel, near Dartmouth, where, as a child, his neighbours were the three Gilbert brothers and their half brother, Walter Raleigh. Humphrey Gilbert was to publish a <em>Discourse for a discovery for a new passage to Cataia  </em>(China) in 1576 and to claim Newfoundland for Queen Elizabeth in 1583, whilst the youngest brother, Adrian Gilbert was also a keen promoter of voyages of exploration. Davis was known to Dr John Dee, the famous polymath, cosmographer and authority on the art of navigation, who had earlier advised Frobisher before the Arctic voyages of 1576-8.</p><p>To set Davis in context, it needs to be remarked that after the discovery that a huge landmass (the Americas) blocked any possible direct westward sea route to the Far East, the seamen of Spain and Portugal established south-westerly and south-easterly sea routes there, which left other European seafaring nations to seek for northerly ones. In the case of England and later Great Britain, the quest for a North West Passage intermittently over the centuries became almost a national preoccupation, even when by the nineteenth century the existence of such a sea route had little commercial significance. Davis must be counted as an early pioneer in this quest. He discovered what became known as Davis Strait between Greenland and what is now Arctic Canada, carefully charting his route and thus enabling his successors to sail further than he had been able to do during his three Arctic voyages in the reign of Queen Elizabeth.</p><p>It was in the course of his fourth voyage to find a passage, in 1591-93, this time in a south-westerly direction via the Strait of Magellan and into the Pacific, that his vessel the <em>Desire </em>in mid-August 1592 was</p><blockquote><blockquote>driven in among certaine Isles never before discovered by any knowen relation lying fiftie leagues or better from the shore East and Northerly from The Streights: in which place, unless it had pleased God of his wonderfull mercie to have ceased the winde, wee must of necessitie have perished. But the winde shifting to the East, wee directed our course for The Streights ...</blockquote></blockquote><p>These were undoubtedly the Falklands and Davis has been credited with their discovery by his biographer, Sir Clements Markham (1889) and by the <em>Oxford Companion to Ships and the Sea </em>(1979). However, in the Hakluyt Society edition (1880) of Davis' voyages and works, the editor, Albert Hastings Markham, remarked in a lengthy footnote that 'there is very conclusive evidence to prove that the Falkland Islands had been discovered long before the time of either Davis or Hawkins, and called the Ascension Islands, but by whom it is difficult to decide'. He concludes, after reference to a number of globes and charts in which these islands apparently feature, that 'the honour of their discovery must belong to some unknown foreign navigator'. This hypothesis has been followed up (see First <a href=\"/biographies/discoverers_the\">DISCOVERERS)</a> by the modern scholar, Graham Pascoe, who cites maps by Pedro Reinel c1519 and André Thevet, 1586 for a Portuguese discovery, but gives credit to Davis and his crew for being the first Englishmen to see the Falklands, as related in John Jane's account, published by Hakluyt in 1600. Nevertheless, it may be prudent to remember that features on early maps and charts do not always exist, as Captain Cook often found during his great voyages. Failing an accompanying Portuguese narrative, as Clements Markham pointed out, we may still be correct in giving credit to Davis for the first sighting of the Falklands.</p><p>Davis not only practised navigation, but wrote about it. His book <em>The Seamans Secrets </em>went into eight editions between 1594 and 1657. It was illustrated with drawings, one of which shows the use of the back staff, which he invented. In 1595 he published <em>The Worldes hydrographical discription </em>in which he endeavoured to prove that all lands were habitable and all seas navigable. Sadly none of his charts survive.</p><p>He made three more voyages, all to the East Indies. The first was with the Dutch in 1598-1600. The second was with Sir James Lancaster on the historic first voyage of the English East India Company, 1601-03. His last voyage was as pilot with Sir Edward Michelborne in 1604-05. He lost his life at the eastern end of the Straits of Malacca on 27 December 1605 at the hands of Japanese pirates. So died a skilled scientific navigator and pilot, one of the great seamen of the reign of the first Queen Elizabeth.</p>",

        "body": "<p>mariner and farmer, was born in Stanley on 30 January 1893, son of John Davis, shepherd and sailmaker, and Elizabeth Ann, née Brown. Elizabeth Ann was the widow of Robert Hutchinson and already the mother of four children when she married John Davis. They went on to have another ten children, of whom Jack was the eldest, so he grew up surrounded by a large family. His father worked in the FIC sail loft, which may have sparked the interest in the sea that was to colour Jack's whole life.</p><p>He began his career on boats at an early age and in 1917 he first appears in FIG records as master of the cutter  <em>Indiana </em>, running general cargo around East Falkland and working the tussac islands. He sailed her for about five years and in 1924 bought a half share (with Vere Falkland Summers) in the 24 ton wooden sailing ketch  <em>Perfecto Garcia </em>. This larger vessel enabled him to venture slightly further afield and he began to include West Falkland in his voyages, although still undertaking the same kind of work. For a time in the early 1930s he worked in sealing at Albemarle and commanded the sealing vessel  <em>Port Richard </em>(later known as the  <em>Afterglow </em>) for the Falkland Islands Sealing Company. Other boats owned at one time or another by Jack Davis included the cutter  <em>Paloma </em>and the ex-government pilot boat,  <em>Penguin. </em>Early in World War II, the  <em>Perfecto Garcia </em>went ashore in a gale and had to be broken up. She was a great loss, both to Davis and the local community as a whole. In 1952, as part of a local consortium, the Intercoastal Trading Company, Jack acquired part-ownership of the largest of his fleet,  <em>Protector III </em>. She was a 162 ton wooden motor vessel built in Novia Scotia in 1944 as a minesweeper for the Royal Navy and brought to the Falklands by the Colonial Development Corporation in 1949 to work at Albemarle Sealing Station.</p><p>Although Jack Davis spent much of his life at sea, he was also interested in farming and in the late 1930s rented Hummock Island from Roy Cove, where he ran about seven hundred sheep. After World War II he also briefly rented the Jasons from Dean Brothers. In 1949 he bought New Island from George Scott and farmed it for the next twenty years. With the island, he inherited two more vessels, the cutters  <em>Overseas </em>and  <em>Saxon </em>. When the Intercoastal Trading Company was dissolved in 1954, Jack also became the sole owner of  <em>Protector III,  </em>but could not afford engine repair costs. In the early 1960s, he arranged for the  <em>Philomel  </em>to <em> </em>tow her to New Island, where she still lies beached in the harbour below the settlement.</p><p>Jack Davis married Agnes Mary Janet Halliday in 1943: they had two children, Helen (b1945) and Raymond (b1948). During their ownership of New Island the Davis family were renowned for their hospitality. Among those they played host to were the crews of Russian whaling and intelligence vessels, who called there even during the Cold War. The most notable visit was in 1957, just after the world's first man-made satellite 'Sputnik', had been successfully launched. A Russian scientific vessel was based at New Island to track the satellite and receive telemetry data, so the Davis family were probably among the first people in the world, outside Russia, to witness these historic transmissions.</p><p>Jack Davis would always refer to himself as JJD, Cracker Jack, or Cracker - the last was what most people called him. He was a very hard-working man who also played hard. His heavy drinking bouts were legendary and would culminate at times with his standing, huge hands and feet outstretched and a fixed stare, exclaiming in a gruff voice 'Just the same old JJD ... hands, feet and manhood' before falling flat on his face. He was known as the last of the Falklands pirates, famous for flying the Jolly Roger from the masthead of vessels under his command. Greenhorn lads, serving their first voyage with Jack, would be surprised at the lack of victualling for the crew. Apart from black coffee, tea, bread, dripping and tobacco, there was nothing else until the first port was reached, where he would liberate a mutton carcass or two from the farm meathouse and anything else, such as eggs or vegetables, that might come his way. The boat might call at an uninhabited island, where some sheep would be rounded up and loaded on board. When asked the name of the place, the answer would always be 'Green Island, ché' and when they discharged it would be 'Hummock, ché'. At times he was known to re-load part of a recently-discharged cargo of timber during the night, either to deliver to Hummock or sell on to some unsuspecting farmer. People in camp generally turned a blind eye to his exploits, as he could always be relied on to keep to a schedule, which was crucial, especially with mail and basic supplies.</p><p>Jack Davis was certainly a colourful figure, whose exploits acquired a legendary status around the Falklands. He was a folk hero to Stanley boys, who used to compete for the privilege of rowing him back to his vessel after a heavy drinking session in the Globe. His buccaneering ways were admired or disapproved of by his contemporaries in almost equal measure and his forceful personality made an impact on all who encountered him. He died on 30 September 1969 and is buried in Stanley cemetery.</p>",

The transmitter was powered by pedalling whilst transmitting Morse code.

He was orphaned at the age of nine and brought up by his aunt Sarah Croft (née Dean), housekeeper to George <a href=\"/biographies/whitington_george\">WHITINGTON</a>. His sister Mary died in infancy and his brother Ralph was lost at sea. Dean was employed as foreman/clerk to John Bull <a href=\"/biographies/whitington_john\">WHITINGTON</a> and landed at Port Louis on 17 November 1840 with his wife Charlotte, aged 23 and two children. John Bull Whitington, brother of George had emigrated to the Islands in the brigs  <em>Susan </em>and  <em>Mary Ann </em>to start a fish curing business with other settlers and all the requisites for the colony. The business was a failure and they started farming sheep and dealing in cattle hides. By 1 April 1842 Dean was acting as agent for Whitington who had returned home temporarily, and in October 1845 he was the government auctioneer in Stanley. The 1851 census gives his occupation as storekeeper. As Lloyds Agent in 1860 he was purchasing wrecks from the government and from this business he expanded his interests and bought what is now the West Store and Marmont Row (including the Upland Goose Hotel). Most of the inhabitants placed their business with Dean to the irritation of the Falkland Islands Company, which had received its Charter in 1852, and there was great rivalry between the two. As one of the leading citizens in Stanley he petitioned the Governor on behalf of the inhabitants against a measure designed to surrender control of the wild cattle into private hands as the 'petitioners look upon the herds...as a birthright and their only safeguard against a possible monopoly of the principal article of consumption'. In 1861, wishing to expand his activities, he applied for a lease of Pebble Island at £20 a year for 20 years. Before it expired, the Government allowed him to purchase the island for £400 in 1869. There followed the acquisition of Port Edgar in 1885, the purchase of Chartres with Mr Anson in 1886 and Port Stephens in 1892. In 1870 he was offered a seat in the Legislative Council.</p><p>To ensure that his business and properties were kept well supplied Dean bought a succession of sailing vessels, among them the  <em>Sea Witch, Selton, Irene, Allen Gardiner II ( </em>renamed <em>Richard Williams), Dennis Brundrit, Orissa  </em>and <em>Karina Kirsten.  </em>In 1882 the German Kosmos line obtained a contract to run the mails to the West and Dean, not to be outdone, purchased the steamer  <em>Ranee  </em>eventually taking over the mails in 1885.</p><p>He married Charlotte Millyard in 1834 and, had nine children: George Markham (b1837), Frances (b1838), Emma Falkland (b1842), Emily (b1844), Charles Montague (b1847), Charlotte Millyard (b1848), Matilda (b1849), Ralph (b1851) and John Hall <a href=\"/biographies/dean_john\">DEAN</a> (b1853). In 1888 when George Markham, his eldest son, died, the properties in Stanley together with the  <em>Dennis Brundrit </em>,  <em>Orissa  </em>and the hulk  <em>Charles Cooper </em>were sold to the FIC of which he soon became a Director.</p><p>John Markham Dean died at Stoke Newington in England in 1903 after a lifetime devoted to the expansion of his businesses and the development of the Islands to the considerable benefit of his fellow citizens.</p>",

In 1862 she married George Markham Dean, born in 1837, the eldest son of JM <a href=\"/biographies/dean_john1\">DEAN</a> and came to the Falkland Islands with him the following year. They had no children.</p><p>Orissa's diary for 1866 gives a very good idea of the life she led as a young woman. Small though Stanley was there was a large amount of socialising in which she bore her part, and the menus for dinner parties were very extensive. One such for 13 January says that there were six guests who sat down to cantatrice soup, curried oysters, roast of fowls, boiled tongue, boiled leg of mutton, steak and oyster pie, potatoes, peas, cabbage, bread and caper sauces, golden pudding, blancmange and custards. On another evening after a very similar menu they 'cleared away the table and had a dance'. She and her husband both rode, and she refers to the horses being fetched in from Mare Harbour and the man who brought them being given £1.</p><p>Orissa and George were very happy. Of George's birthday in March she says 'My darling Pet's birthday 29 years old, bless my own love' and of her own birthday 'Pet gave me a rosebud, I preferred it to any birthday gift he could have given me, bless him, he picked it in Packes garden'. Their fourth wedding anniversary in October led to the comment 'The 4th Anniversary of our wedding day, bless my Pet. I love him more than ever if possible'.</p><p>At this time George, with his brother Charles Montague (Monte) Dean (1847-1902) had taken over the running of the very successful family firm from their father who had retired to England. Orissa was very well informed about the business, and throughout the diary refers to 'our ship' arriving, or the fact that George had beaten his competitors by being 'out of the Narrows before any of them started' and secured the business of a passing vessel. Her diary records to whom she wrote on each outward mail, and that 'Pet wrote to Far [JM Dean] with the Lloyds and Underwriters lists' and also made 'the American and Danish Consular returns'. There was also a Dean store and ship's chandlers, for which George and his brother were responsible, and one entry records the fact that 'Pet took up two Whalers for making a disturbance in the Store, they have to appear tomorrow'. Both went to prison for four days. Another entry refers to the <em>Gefle </em>, a Swedish man-of-war, requiring six month's provisions.</p><p>In 1866 the Deans moved in to Stanley Cottage, one of the very first houses to be built in Stanley in the 1840s. Orissa's diary gives progress reports: 'The men very busy painting Stanley Cottage for us to move into, it will look very well. Pet and I have been up attending to the flowers in the greenhouse', and finally on 22 September: 'moved into Stanley Cottage and slept here, all nice and clean'. Two weeks later they held a house-warming, with a massive dinner menu for six guests, and everybody else invited for later. The move also involved sitting in a 'new pew' next day at church.</p><p>In 1869 George Dean leased Port Stephens and Albemarle land from government, his partners being his brother and father. In 1874 he added Port Edgar when CH Williams went out of business. The first manager was a Swiss missionary named <a href=\"/biographies/hunziker_johann\">HUNZIKER</a> and sheep numbers rose considerably. The Deans also built Jubilee Villas in 1887 to commemorate Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee.</p><p>William Luxton, a Royal Marine who had arrived in the Falklands in 1864, was employed by George Dean and it seems likely that his wife, Mary Ann, worked for Mrs. Dean. When Luxton died in September 1881 at the age of thirtynine, leaving his wife with three children, the Deans took the entire family under their wing and the children became the children that they had never had. When Orissa was widowed in 1888 it was a blow from which she never recovered. George Dean left her a wealthy woman, and the Luxton family were also remembered, he left the 'furnishings of a kitchen, a sittingroom and two bedrooms' to Mary Ann, and one thousand pounds on trust for her children. Orissa was responsible for sending John Luxton to London to be trained as a cabinet-maker, for giving Beatrice a grand wedding in 1892 (the first by banns in the newly consecrated Christ Church Cathedral), and William jun. went to work on the Dean farm at Port Stephens. Beatrice died in 1895 on Keppel Island after giving birth to her second child. Her husband, William Lewis left his daughter Orissa (Rissy) aged two and his new born son with his mother-in-law and Orissa Dean before leaving to live and work in Patagonia where he re-married. When he returned he took his son back with him but Rissy stayed in the Falklands. Although not formally adopted by Orissa Dean, Rissy was known as Rissy Lewis Dean and was to all intents and purposes her dearly loved daughter. William's wedding to Maud Smith was celebrated at Stanley Cottage in 1901, as was that of Rissy Lewis to Reginald <a href=\"/biographies/pole-evans_reginald\">POLE-EVANS</a> in 1916.</p><p>When George Dean died in 1888 negotiations began almost immediately to sell the very extensive Dean businesses to the Falkland Islands Company, except for the farms, Port Stephens (sold later to the Falkland Islands Company), and Pebble Island. Orissa inherited all the proceeds of her husband's share in the family concerns, and his interests in the retained farms.</p><p>When Orissa arrived in the Islands the church was in the Exchange building and known as Holy Trinity. Here she played the harmonium nearly every Sunday for morning and evening services, until the church was destroyed by a peat slip in 1886. The services were then held in a sail loft, until Christ Church Cathedral was consecrated in early 1892. Orissa Dean was one of the major benefactors of the new cathedral, helping to raise money for the construction, and giving the west window, the turret clock and five bells as a lasting memorial to her husband. It was not only Christ Church Cathedral that was so generously supported by Orissa. In 1909 she had Cemetery Cottage built, and a plaque attached reads:</p><blockquote><blockquote>This cottage is erected by Mrs. George M. Dean for the caretaker of Stanley Cemetery, 1909, in loving memory of her dead husband George Markham Dean, her godchildren Beatrice Mary Lewis, George Thomas Luxton and all those who are sleeping their last long sleep in this resting place. Until the day breaks and the shadows flee away.</blockquote></blockquote><p>In 1880 a set of silver gilt and enamel tableware (to be found in the Museum today) was presented 'to Mrs. Geo. M. Dean by the Colonists as a mark of their appreciation of her kindness and charity to the sick and of her devotion generally to good works among the Settlers'.</p><p>In early 1896 Orissa Dean released Charles Anson from his mortgage of £8,294 on the property known as The Chartres, and on the same day Orissa and Charles Anson agreed to become partners, the name of the firm to be Dean and Anson, Charles Anson having sole responsibility for the management and Orissa Dean agreeing to pay him a salary of two hundred and fifty pounds per annum. The Ansons had lost two children in 1890 and thirteen years later they had a son. In 1905 they left the Falklands, and William Luxton moved from Port Stephens where he was head shepherd and sub-manager to become manager at The Chartres. William and Maud Luxton had three children, and Orissa Dean, whom they all called Dubbie, kept in very frequent telegraphic touch with them and with Rissy Pole-Evans at Port Howard, who also had three children, once the radio station was established at Fox Bay in 1918.</p><p>Orissa Dean died in September, 1920, after a long illness. She left her share and interest in Port Stephens and Port Edgar to her nephew WM Dean, (the son of Charles Dean) and The Chartres to William Luxton. In addition she left Stanley Cottage to William Luxton, and to various members of the Luxton family the four Jubilee villas, among a large number of bequests.</p><p><a href=\"/biographies/the_luxton\">See Image 220</a></p>",

He was ordained in the Church of England in July 1837 and was honorary secretary of the Patagonian Missionary Society from 1850 to 1856. He rallied the Society's supporters when the news of Allen GARDINER's death reached England in April 1852. The next stage of developing their plans was completed by the launching of the mission schooner <em>Allen Gardiner </em>in 1854.</p><p>In October, the first party of missionaries sailed out in her to reach Keppel Island in February 1855. A year later Despard accepted the appointment of Superintendent of the Mission, giving up a school at Redlands, Bristol. He, with his family, followed on board the <em>Hydaspes </em>, together with four other missionaries. They reached Stanley in September 1856. Despard arrived with his second wife, Frances Margaret, née Ravizzoti, and the five surviving children by his first wife, Emily Coffin née Kebston, Emily (b1844), Bertha (b1845), Florence (b1847), Harriet (b1849) and Emilius Pakenham (b1849). Their two adopted sons also were part of the party, Thomas <a href=\"/biographies/bridges_thomas\">BRIDGES</a> (aged 13) and Frank Jones (aged 10). For lack of accommodation, Mrs Despard and the girls were not able to live on Keppel Island until the beginning of 1858.</p><p>Soon after his arrival at Stanley, Despard had to deal with two members of his party who would not accept his authority, Rev JF OGLE and Captain WP <a href=\"/biographies/snow_william\">SNOW</a>. Each resigned from his post. Despard had both to establish the base at Keppel Island for the fledgling Mission and build up the contacts with the Indians. So, by the end of 1857 he had made a total of 25 voyages in the <em>Allen Gardiner </em>, spending most of the time at sea. Another blow struck the Mission group when in March 1859, James Ellis, the original leader and surgeon, died on Keppel Island, having taken his own life, a victim of the pressures brought about by living in crowded conditions. The crowning disaster during Despard's leadership was the massacre of eight members of the mission party by Indians in November 1859 at Wulaia, Navarin Island. The <em>Allen Gardiner </em>had returned a group of nine Indians from Keppel. In the days that followed, unexpectedly the Tierra del Fuego Indians set upon the missionaries and the crew of the Mission vessel. Only the cook escaped. Governor <a href=\"/biographies/moore_thomas\">MOORE</a> was critical of Despard for searching the Indians before their return, thus provoking them, and for his insensitive treatment of the two widows who were sent unaccompanied to Stanley for return to England. He prohibited any more Indians being taken to Keppel Island.</p><p>Despard decided in 1860 to resign his responsibilities and left the Keppel Mission. He with his wife and daughters got back to Bristol in January 1862 in the <em>Allen Gardiner </em>. William <a href=\"/biographies/bartlett_william\">BARTLETT</a> remained in charge of the farm and Thomas Bridges responsible for the Indians. During 1863, Despard found a new sphere of work in Australia. He died in Kyneton, Victoria on 5 May 1881.</p><p>Despard started the collection of Yahgan words, while Bridges continued and completed the work. Despard laid strong foundations for the later years of the Mission, and dealt successfully with some very adverse situations. He was the author of <em>Hope Deferred, Not Lost </em>, Seeleys, J Nisbet &amp; Co, London, [nd? 1853].</p>",

He went to the local elementary school, then continued into secondary education at St McCartan's College in Monaghan. In 1881, at the age of eighteen, Patrick Diamond decided to become a priest and travelled to Turin in Italy to the Religious Congregation of Salesians, the Congregation of Priests and Brothers recently founded by Don John Bosco. There he began six years of study to become a priest. Later that same year, he was sent to South America, and continued his studies in Buenos Aires. He made his religious profession as a member of the Salesian Congregation on 9 February 1884.</p><p>In October 1887 he was ordained priest. His first appointment was to teach in one of the Salesian schools in Buenos Aires. Six months later he was appointed to the Falkland Islands where there had not been a priest since the departure of Fr James <a href=\"/biographies/foran_james\">FORAN</a> in 1886. Diamond arrived in the Falkland Islands on 19 April 1888. He was young and inexperienced both as a priest and as a teacher, but set to work ministering to the spiritual needs of the Catholic population, visiting them in their homes, gathering them for Mass and preparing them for reception of the sacraments. He belonged to a Congregation which had been founded in 1859 to provide education and training for young people. To re-establish the Catholic school was one of his priorities. Eighteen months into his mission, Diamond had built a mission house that also served as a school. To the money which the Catholic congregation raised for these purposes, he made a large contribution from his own savings. At the end of 1889 it was recorded that he was in charge of the school comprising some sixty boys and girls and was teaching four hours daily.</p><p>Fr Diamond moved to Punta Arenas to become superior in the Salesian Mission House there, and then back again to the Falklands. He finally left the Falklands in 1905, worked in a New York parish until 1921, then in San Francisco until 1937. He died in San Francisco on 26 March 1937.</p><p>That Fr Diamond was the priest sent to the Falkland Islands as the trailblazer for the Salesian Mission tells us of the confidence his religious congregation had in him. He was young, not yet twenty-five years old, and only six months a priest. He saw his work as three-fold: to build up the Catholic community; to establish a mission house that would serve as a centre for his Catholic congregation; and to provide education for the young people of the Falklands, irrespective of their religion. What he accomplished in the first eighteen months after his arrival marks him as a man of action, capable of seeing what needed doing and setting out to accomplish it in a way that would benefit the whole Falklands community. He had built his mission house and was running a school for upwards of sixty pupils. He laid a foundation on which future Salesian priests and Sisters would build. The School closed in 1941, but St Mary's parish flourishes.</p>",

'An Irishman who had been a gaucho and had come to the island in Don Vernet's debt', reported a Britsh visitor, 'had not only paid it off [through gaming] but had been enabled to give him seven hundred and fifty dollars for a building which he had converted into a store'.

        "body": "<p>The Falklands first appear on maps from the mid 1520s, but there survives no written record of their discovery. Many people have therefore felt entitled to say on behalf of some chosen candidate, ‘ <em>he </em> discovered the Falklands' though in fact all claims so far made on behalf of people whose names are known can be shown to be untrue.</p><p>The claim for the earliest discovery in chronological terms has been made on behalf of Fuegian or Patagonian tribesmen centuries or even millennia ago. Evidence for that claim was provided by the warrah, the Falklands fox, extinct by the 1880s which was remarked upon by many visitors in the same breath as they levelled their muskets at it. Fuegians or Patagonians may have been blown across to the Falklands in their canoes carrying tame hunting dogs (warrahs) with them. There is naturally no record of such an event but it should at least be borne in mind - the real first discoverers of the Falklands may have been very humble indeed, and they may have arrived at any time from about 10,000 years ago, since it is not known when the warrah arrived in the islands (by contrast, the fur seal has been shown to have been present on Beauchene Island about 11,000 years ago).</p><p>Geologists have established that there was never a land bridge by which the warrah might have reached the islands, so the canoe-passenger theory seems the most likely route by which it arrived. The theory that it rode on ice-floes or rafted without human participation is weaker - if foxes arrived on ice-floes other vertebrates such as pumas or mice could have done the same. But the Falklands never had any other indigenous vertebrates, which argues in favour of the canoe theory: pumas and mice would not have been such likely occupants of a canoe. However, even if the warrahs did arrive by canoe, we shall never know whether the canoes' owners survived the journey - perhaps the human occupants died before the warrahs disembarked, and hence never saw the Falklands. So this theory is doomed to remain unprovable, while at the same time also remaining un-disprovable.</p><p>The same is not true of the next claim, first advanced by the retired Royal Navy submarine captain Gavin Menzies in 2002: he claimed the Falklands were first discovered in 1421 by one of the treasure fleets sent out by the Chinese Ming emperor Zhu Di. These fleets, with some ships larger than Nelson's  <em>Victory, </em> really did sail around the Indian Ocean between 1405 and 1431, but the idea that they visited the Falklands is based on mistaken interpretations of early maps. Menzies claims that the Piri Reis map of 1513, now in Istanbul, shows Patagonia, the Magellan Strait and also a compass rose placed on the Falklands by the Chinese for navigational purposes. In February 2006 he presented another map which he claims is a copy made in 1763 of a Chinese map of 1418 showing the whole world. Both of these claims are untenable - the Piri Reis map only goes down to Río de Janeiro (what Menzies takes for Patagonia is in fact Brazil), while the other map is a Chinese copy of an 18th-century European map. Menzies's claim is thus not only disprovable but indubitably disproved.</p><p>The next claim in historical sequence is that made on behalf of Amerigo Vespucci, the man after whom America is named, who explored the coasts of America in two voyages between 1499 and 1502. Unfortunately for him, his accounts were pirated and published in forged garbled versions, one of which, known as the Soderini letter, contains a brief mention of sailing north-east in a south-westerly storm from somewhere in Patagonia and sighting twenty leagues of a bare coast. This has been taken to be the Falklands by many writers going back to <a href=\"/biographies/bougainville_louis\">BOUGAINVILLE</a> in 1771, but it is a myth - the direction of sailing makes it impossible that any islands were the Falklands, and the entire text is a forgery anyway.</p><p>The best evidence for the real first discoverers of the Falklands is found in two maps with a Portuguese connection: the Pedro Reinel map of around 1519 now in Istanbul, and André Thevet's engraved map of 1586 in Paris, based on a Portuguese original. Thevet's accompanying text says he obtained the original of his map from an old Portuguese captain in Lisbon, who had been with the first visitors to the Islands, some Portuguese accompanying Magellan in his voyage. There is abundant evidence that Magellan's expedition did not visit the Islands, so perhaps the old captain was upgrading his map to get a better price. Judging by the joint evidence of these two maps, the Falklands were first sighted by an otherwise unknown Portuguese expedition in around 1518-19, which explored the north coast and sailed down Falkland Sound but did not see any outlying islands. Several Spanish and Portuguese maps from the mid to late 1520s show the islands as little blobs or dots.</p><p>However, the Pedro Reinel and Thevet maps disappeared into archives and only emerged in the late 20th century, so in their absence various other first discoverers were put forward. The earliest were the crew of the unknown Spanish ship christened  <em>Incognita </em> by Julius <a href=\"?q=node/203\">GOEBEL</a>, who spent several months in 1540 among some islands that can only have been the Falklands. But since they recorded that they had maps that showed the islands, they were obviously not the first discoverers.</p><p>The next people to see the Falklands, over half a century later, were the explorer John <a href=\"?q=node/143\">DAVIS</a> and his crew in the  <em>Desire </em>. On 14 August 1592 they were blown out of the Magellan Strait in a storm, into ‘some islands never before discovered by any knowen relation', which must have been the Falklands. Davis was long regarded in Britain as the first discoverer of the Islands, but that is clearly disproved by the Pedro Reinel and Thevet maps. Davis and his men were at any rate the first Englishmen to see the Islands, and their account, published in London in 1600 by Richard Hakluyt, was the first printed reference to the Islands.</p><p>Davis was followed by Sir John HAWKINS who sailed along the Falklands' north coast in the  <em>Daintie </em> on 2 February 1594 and named the Islands ‘Hawkins' Maidenland'. He sighted what is now called the Eddystone Rock at the northern entrance to Falkland Sound and christened it the ‘Condite Head', since it looked like a conduit head, a well bringing piped water into the City of London.</p><p>On 24 January 1600 the Dutchman Sebald de <a href=\"?q=node/482\">WEERT</a> sighted the Islands, and his mention of them was spread widely by maps, though mapmakers had trouble with his name, calling the Islands the ‘Iles Sebaldes', the ‘Sebaldines', the ‘Sibble de Wards', ‘Los Selvajes' and the like. Until recently he was often wrongly credited with the first discovery of the Falklands.</p><p>The Islands were sighted on 27 January 1690 by the captain of the  <em>Welfare </em>, John <a href=\"?q=node/449\">STRONG</a>, who called them ‘Hawkinsland'. That day some of his men landed on one of the islands off the north coast of the Falklands, and again on 29 January somewhere near where Port Howard is today. This was formerly described by some writers as the first landing on the Islands, but Strong's men had clearly been preceded by over 170 years by the Portuguese expedition, and by some 150 years by the crew of the  <em>Incognita </em>.</p><p>Finally, in the early eighteenth century the islands were seen by many French navigators from St Malo in Brittany, who knew nothing of earlier accounts and thought they were the first discoverers. On 19 January 1701 one of them, Jacques Gouin de <a href=\"?q=node/32\">BEAUCHENE</a>, sighted the island that bears his name, and others described the Sea Lion Islands, which may perhaps not have been seen before, so the French were not the ‘first discoverers' but may have been ‘later discoverers' of previously unknown islands. Their accounts caused the islands to appear on French maps from about 1705 onwards, and led the mapmaker Guillaume Delisle to christen them Les Iles Malouines, (the St Malo Islands) on his maps of 1720 and 1722. The name is still used in French (alongside ‘Les Iles Falkland')' and has been used in Spanish from the later 18th century, first as ‘Islas Maluinas' and from about 1805 as ‘Islas Malvinas'.</p><p>To sum up: unless more documents emerge, the first discoverers of the Falklands must be presumed to have been Portuguese, in about 1518-19. All these claims are analysed in detail in  <em>The Falklands Saga </em> by Graham Pascoe and Peter Pepper (forthcoming).</p>",

Young Draycott attended Loughborough Grammar School and then Godalming County School where he was proficient at games and became school captain.</p><p>On leaving school he worked for a short time as a land worker on a market garden and became a local dispatch rider before taking up elementary teaching in Effingham Central School. He registered as an uncertificated teacher in 1941. He had taken care of horses at Godalming and this probably prompted him to apply for the post as travelling teacher in the Falklands, which in those days meant considerable time on horseback. Draycott received his call-up papers the same day as his teaching contract with the Falkland Islands Government. Uncertain of what to do, he sought guidance and the sound advice received was to take up the Falklands' contract.</p><p>Arriving in Stanley on 22 August 1941, Draycott travelled extensively around the Islands on horseback, teaching both on the West and East Falklands. His sense of humour was severely tested during this time, when he was given a horse to take him along the track and then wondered why there was considerable interest from the farm workers during gearing up. When he finally managed to mount the horse, the animal gave a 'rodeo' performance, finally depositing him in the mud and stones in the corral much to the amusement of the onlookers - the horse apparently had never been ridden before!</p><p>1942 saw the evacuation of some 46 Stanley children to Walker Creek.

There he met Alma Jones, a young local assistant teacher whom he was to marry in 1945. Times were difficult at Walker Creek and discipline was called for on occasions. One time he had to discipline young Roddy McKay who had 'disappeared' for the day causing much anxiety. Years later they found themselves together on the riding track between settlements; Draycott was told to get off his horse and fearing the now mature man was to take revenge did so with some trepidation only to have his hand shaken and be thanked for the rather hard lesson he had administered.</p><p>From Walker Creek, Draycott became second assistant master in the Senior School, Stanley and then in 1949 spent a year attaining a Ministry of Education Certificate at Redlands Training College, Bristol, during which time a daughter, Jacqueline was born. On returning to the islands in 1950 to take up a teaching post in the Senior School, Draycott worked his way to being senior assistant master, acting superintendent of education (which included responsibility for Camp education) and finally superintendent of education in 1960.

        "body": " <p>Chilean governor and brigadier, was born in Valparaiso in 1840. He was of foreign origin, being French on his father's side. On leaving school he entered the military academy, from which he graduated in 1860 with the rank of second lieutenant in the artillery. In his professional career he was outstanding for his extensive knowledge of languages and mathematics, which allowed him to translate artillery manuals in English and French for use by the military. In 1866, he took part in the war against Spain. He was a teacher of English, geometry, astronomy and world history in the secondary school of Valparaiso. He became adjutant of the military academy, reaching the rank of regimental major in the marine artillery regiment.</p><p>In 1874, he was appointed governor of the colony of Magellanes in Punta Arenas. In this post he distinguished himself by his concern for development, and particularly for European immigration. Having learned of the successful introduction of sheep into the Falkland Islands, he became interested in the possibility of doing the same in the steppe-like fields of southern Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego, until then virgin. So in December 1876, he travelled to Stanley in the corvette  <em>Chacabuco </em>of the Chilean Navy to visit and establish relations with the government of the Falkland Islands. After Almeida's ten day visit, Governor <a href=\"/biographies/callaghan_jeremiah\">CALLAGHAN</a> reported to London:</p><blockquote><blockquote>As Sandy Point {Punta Arenas} is likely before long to become a thriving settlement it would be greatly to our advantage to have steam communication between it and this port, it would open up a good market for our sheep, cattle and other products for which we can get in exchange flour, coal and wood - articles much needed here. I may observe in conclusion that if the foregoing enterprizes prove successful the progress of this Colony may be regarded as assured.</blockquote></blockquote><p> <em>Many of these hopes were to be disappointed, but the appointment of FE <a href=\"/biographies/cobb_frederick\">COBB</a> as honorary consul for Chile in June 1877 was almost certainly agreed during this visit. </em></p><p>In Stanley Duble Almeida had acquired a consignment of 300 sheep which he took back with him to Punta Arenas. These were later sold to the British immigrant Henry Reynard for a breeding experiment, on Isabel Island in the Strait of Magellan. From this successful experiment, in 1877, came the introduction of sheep into the territory for breeding on a large scale. In a short while, sheep became the economic base for the later development and progress of the southern region of America.</p><p>The marked severity with which Duble Almeida carried out his duties as governor provoked resentment among the people and in November 1877 there was a mutiny by the naval gunners in the garrison. Sadly, this unfortunate event led to loss of life and damage to both public and private property. Seen in a poor light and humiliated, he resigned his position at the beginning of 1878. A year later when Chile declared war on Peru and Bolivia, he took part in various actions and operations of that war (the War of the Pacific), which lasted until 1884. His brilliant wartime conduct culminated in him becoming political and military head of the city of Puno in Peru. Later he assumed command of the military garrison of Santiago de Chile, and, already a colonel, the command of the marine battalion and coastal artillery of Valparaiso. In 1891, he was in Europe on a commission to buy arms for the Army when the revolution against the government of Jose Manuel Balmaceda suddenly broke out. As a result of this he was retired from the army. He rejoined the army later, and was promoted to the rank of brigadier. He died in Santiago on 10 April 1921.</p>",

        "body": "<p> French admiral and explorer, was born into a noble family at Condé-sur-Noireau in Normandy on 23 May 1790 during the violence of the French Revolution. As a young sea officer, denied his wish to embark in <a href=\"/biographies/freycinet_louis-claude\">FREYCINET</a>'s  <em>Uranie </em>, he interested himself in the natural history and archaeology of the Mediterranean and Black Sea in the  <em>Chevrette </em>and was instrumental in the acquisition of a newly unearthed Greek statue, the Venus de Milo, now in the Louvre in Paris. In May 1821 he was made a Chevalier of the Légion d'Honneur and in the August of that year, he was promoted  <em>lieutenant de vaisseau </em>after nine years' service as  <em>enseigne </em>. With another young lieutenant, JI <a href=\"/biographies/duperrey_louis\">DUPERREY</a>, recently returned to Paris from Freycinet's voyage in the ill-fated  <em>Uranie </em>, he proposed a voyage of discovery and circumnavigation. Command of the  <em>Coquille </em>was given to Duperrey, with Dumont d'Urville as first lieutenant. He published, at his own expense, a botanical work entitled  <em>Enumeratio Plantarum </em> while supervising the preparations for the expedition's departure.</p><p>The  <em>Coquille </em>left Toulon on 11 August 1822 and did not return there for thirty-two months, when her captain and officers received much praise from the Institut de France. Although his dreams of taking part in such a voyage of scientific and geographical exploration had been realised, Dumont d'Urville regretted that Duperrey, rather than he, was in command. Nevertheless despite a myriad of exacting duties aboard ship, he spent his leisure in classifying the plants he had collected and in writing up his observations, not only in his particular spheres of botany and entomology, but also on other phenomena, such as phosphorescence. On arrival in the Falklands, where she stayed from 13 November to 18 December, the  <em>Coquille </em>anchored in the Baie Française {Berkeley Sound} from which Dumont d'Urville made botanical excursions, one with the naturalist <a href=\"/biographies/lesson_rene-primevere\">LESSON</a>, the second a year later. He published a first flora of the Iles Malouines (Falkland Islands): of the Islands' total of 163 species, the botanist of the  <em>Uranie </em>, Gaudichaud, had collected 64 and Dumont d'Urville 93. The collections made during the rest of the voyage, in Tahiti, the Carolines, New Holland {Australia} and elsewhere were deposited in the Muséum d'Histoire Naturelle in Paris and received special mention in a report by members of the French Academy of Sciences. On the expedition's return on 24 March 1825, the French government ordered that the results should be published on a splendid scale, which indeed they were.</p><p>Dumont d'Urville was promoted on 12 November 1824 to the rank of  <em>capitaine de frégate </em>, some consolation for the death of his little son during absences at sea. A year later, his proposal for another scientific and geographical voyage was approved, to proceed in the  <em>Coquille </em>, which was renamed  <em>Astrolabe </em>. She departed from Toulon on 25 April 1826, making her way eventually via Australia and New Zealand to the coral reef at Vanikoro (Santa Cruz Islands in the Solomons), where the wreck in 1788 of La Pérouse's  <em>Astrolabe </em>was located and a monument erected. Dumont d'Urville's  <em>Astrolabe </em>returned to France via the Cape on 25 March 1828 at the end of an often perilous scientific and hydrographic survey of the Pacific, lasting for twenty-three months, to an unappreciative reception from the government of Charles X. This French monarch was deposed in 1830 and Dumont d'Urville was given the responsibility for taking him and his family by sea to England, flying the French tricolour there for the first time for many years. The splendidly produced expedition narrative and results,  <em>Voyage de la corvette l'Astrolabe ... 1826 ... 1829  </em>(Paris, 1830-35), for which Dumont d'Urville was largely responsible, served to draw public attention to the Pacific and its peoples.</p><p>Despite attacks of gout and semi-retirement, Dumont d'Urville was given command of a third exploring voyage. In the  <em>Astrolabe  </em>and with the  <em>Zélée  </em>(Captain C-H Jacquinot), he departed from Toulon on 7 September 1837. The main object of this expedition was Pacific anthropology, Dumont d'Urville's great enthusiasm, but the ships also reached the South Orkney Islands, the South Shetlands, Orléans Channel and Joinville Island in the Antarctic. They returned in November 1840. Dumont d'Urville was promoted rear-admiral a year later and also elected president of the Paris Geographical Society. The results of this voyage, which included the discovery of Adélie Land on the continental coast of Antarctica, named after his wife Adèle (a watchmaker's daughter), were also published on a splendid scale. During neither of his two commands did he visit the Falklands again.</p><p>Having survived all the perils and dangers of a life at sea, often sailing in uncharted waters, his end, and that of his wife and second son, came in a railway accident on 8 May 1842, to the horror and dismay of the scientific and maritime world. In the tenth volume of the expedition narrative was published a short but appreciative biography of Dumont d'Urville. In this is quoted a sentence by one of his biographers about his life's work, 'Il interrogeait à la fois la nature morte et la nature vivante, faisait de l'histoire avec des ruines, de la science avec des fleurs, et de l'étude avec toute chose'. (He examined both still life and living nature, he created history out of ruins, science out of flowers and study out of everything.) ( <em>Voyage au Pôle sud, 1847 </em>). The giant kelp, Durvilbea, was named after him.</p>",

        "body": " <p>American naval officer, was born in Rockaway, New Jersey, in 1788. He was appointed a midshipman on 12 November 1810 and saw his first action during the War of 1812-1814* in the USS <em>President,  </em>Captain Stephan Decatur, in engagements with the British frigates <em>Little Belt  </em>in May 1811 and <em>Belvidera </em>in 1812. In late 1813, he was part of a prize crew of a ship which <em>President </em>had captured a few miles off New York, and was held prisoner briefly when the prize was retaken. In 1814, he was ordered to serve on Lake Champlain. As third lieutenant in USS <em>Saratoga,  </em>he came under heavy British gunfire on 6 September 1814, when he was ordered to deliver messages to the commander of the galley <em>Allen.  </em>Severely injured and initially reported as mortally wounded, Duncan lost the use of his right arm and was hospitalised, preventing him from serving in the American victory in the Battle of Lake Champlain five days later. Despite this, his bravery in the campaign leading up to the battle was formally recognized by Congress in 1826 and he was retrospectively awarded the silver medal for the battle. Having recovered from his wounds in 1816, he returned to sea duty in USS <em>Guerriere </em>, Captain Stephan Decatur, in the Mediterranean and participated in the capture of two Algerian vessels with a share in the prize money which resulted. Between 1816 and 1819 he served in USS <em>Independence,  </em>the USS <em>Cyane  </em>on the African coast in 1822-23 and commanded the US schooner <em>Ferret  </em>during anti-piracy operations in the West Indies in 1823-24. On leave of absence from 1824 to 1829, he served on the receiving ship <em>Congress  </em>at Norfolk, Virginia, for two years before being ordered on 18 March 1831 as commander of the sloop USS <em>Lexington  </em>for duty with the U.S. South Atlantic squadron 'to protect our citizens and Commerce, and particularly to protect the American fisheries in the Southern Ocean'.</p><p>The United States government's concern about Louis <a href=\"/biographies/vernet_louis\">VERNET</a>'s proclamation which prohibited foreign vessels from fishing and sealing around East Falkland came to a head in late 1831, when Vernet's men captured several American ships. Hearing of these incidents at Buenos Aires in late November from Captain Gilbert R Davison of the captured schooner <em>Harriet  </em>of Stonington, Connecticut, Duncan and Davison met the US Consul, George W <a href=\"/biographies/slacum_george\">SLACUM</a>. First, Slacum sent a note to Argentine Foreign Minister Manuel de Anchorena, demanding that Argentina give restitution for the captures and stop further harassment of American shipping. When no satisfactory reply was received, Duncan sailed from Buenos Aires on 9 December with Davison on board as his pilot and arrived at Port Louis on 28 December. Duncan investigated the individuals involved and reported to Washington, 'finding them to be of the most iniquitous and illegal character, I determined to break into and disperse this band of pirates, many of whom had been sent from the prisons of Buenos Aires and Montevideo....' On 1 January 1832, with <em>Lexington </em>'s guns ready to fire, the ship's party of US Marines liberated the remaining Americans held prisoner and, on Davidson's identification of the responsible individuals, captured Matthew <a href=\"/biographies/brisbane_matthew\">BRISBANE</a> and six others employed by Vernet. In addition, Duncan embarked 38 members of Vernet's colony, principally of German extraction, who reported that Vernet had deceived them and asked to be returned to Montevideo and Buenos Aires. Before departing from Port Louis on 22 January, Duncan found a schooner which Vernet had apparently been fitting out to attack American fishing vessels and ordered Davison with two seamen to proceed in her to Staten Island to rescue seven American seamen who had been marooned there by Vernet's capture of the American schooner <em>Superior  </em>of New York. Duncan's actions created a storm of protest from Argentina, but Secretary of the Navy Levi Woodbury notified Duncan that President Andrew Jackson 'approved the course which you pursued, and is much gratified at the promptness, firmness and the efficiency of your measures'.</p><p>In August 1832, Duncan left USS <em>Lexington  </em>on a leave of absence to settle some family business affairs. While on leave he died at White Sulphur Springs, Virginia, 14 September 1834.</p><p>Three destroyer-type vessels of the U.S, Navy have been named <em>Duncan </em>(DD-46 built in 1913, DD-485 built in 1942, and DD-874 built in 1944), honouring Silas Duncan, particularly for his gallantry in the Lake Champlain campaign in September 1814.</p>",

His schooling was at Peterhead Academy and Aberdeen Academy. Most of his career was spent in the Department of Zoology, Aberdeen University, initially as a student and later as director of Culterty Field Station, Newburgh, Aberdeenshire, a centre for postgraduate studies dealing with bird problems in agriculture (rooks and geese), and energy flow in an estuarine ecosystem. As Regius professor, he became head of the Zoology Department, and spent time as dean of the Faculty of Science. He was particularly famous for a study of Fulmars on Eynhallow, Orkney, and this developed into one of the best-known long-term studies of birds in the world.</p><p>He was a skilled and effective committee member and chairman, dealing with such diverse ecological topics as the role of badgers in the spread of bovine TB to cattle, minimising the effect of oil exploitation on wildlife (in Britain and Azerbaijan) and the decline of North Atlantic Salmon. He provided advice to science committees for the Nature Conservancy Council, which later became Scottish Natural Heritage and always strove to ensure that sound science underpinned nature conservation and wildlife management.</p><p>His first visit to the Falkland Islands (4-7 January 1964) took place when aboard the <em>Kista Dan </em>en route to various Antarctic islands collecting fleas from the nests of sea birds. Much later (16-23 February 1976) he returned to review a study on Upland Geese, then regarded as a pest competing with sheep for grass. The first field officer was John Harradine, based on Carcass Island. On his recommendations, the goose study became part of the Grasslands Trials Unit under the leadership of Campbell Kerr. Fieldwork was switched to Goose Green and Ron <a href=\"/biographies/summers_ronald\">SUMMERS</a> became the second goose officer, to be succeeded by Andy Douse, the last goose officer. Visits to supervise the study were made in 1978 (30 January-13 February), 1979 (24 January-2 February) and 1983 (24 November-13 December). However, the Argentine invasion effectively terminated the study. After liberation when the subdivision of large company farms into family units gathered momentum, concern about geese dwindled and there was a greater tolerance of the birds. As a result, there have been no further goose studies.</p><p>He married Margaret Thomson in 1953, and is survived by his wife, a son (Ian) and daughter (Karen). His eldest daughter (Judith, wife of Ron <a href=\"/biographies/summers_ronald\">SUMMERS)</a> pre-deceased him.

Duperrey was promoted on his return and awarded the Cross of St Louis, presumably in part for his survey work.</p><p>A year later, he and Dumont d'Urville submitted plans for a voyage of Pacific exploration. The corvette <em>Coquille </em>(380 tons), commanded by Duperrey, departed from Toulon in August 1822, and from Brazil on 30 October for the Falklands, where the <em>Uranie </em>wreck was still visible. After rounding Cape Horn, the expedition visited numerous Pacific islands, including Tahiti and nearby Bora Bora, the Solomons and New Ireland, reaching New South Wales via Timor in January 1824. After two months in Australia, the <em>Coquille </em>visited New Zealand, then passed through the Gilbert and Ellice Islands and the Carolines, arriving in Marseilles via the Dutch East Indies {Indonesia} and Mauritius in March 1825, no man having been lost. The <em>Coquille </em>carried two naturalists, René Primevère <a href=\"/biographies/lesson_rene-primevere\">LESSON</a> (who wrote a two volume narrative) and Prosper Garnot. The scientific results were impressive and were published as a magnificent set between 1826 and 1830. Duperrey wrote the narrative of this round-the-world voyage and other volumes. He was promoted on his return and was later elected to the <em>Académie des Sciences </em>of which he became president in 1850. He was also appointed a member of the <em>Légion d'Honneur </em>.</p><p>Chapters VII and VIII in Duperrey's <em>Voyage autour du Monde </em>(Voyage around the World) relate to the stay in the Falklands of November and December 1822, describing with some emotion the melancholy sight of the <em>Uranie </em>, battered both by easterly gales and the axes of many whalers. Dumont d'Urville (second-in-command) made a two-day botanical excursion to the summit of a hill he called Châtellux {Mount Usborne} west-south-west of their anchorage. Numerous physical observations were made from the observatory erected among the ruins of <a href=\"/biographies/bougainville_louis\">BOUGAINVILLE</a>'s settlement. So much fresh meat and fish was caught that the sailors asked for a return to their shipboard diet of salt pork and salt beef!</p><p>In his second chapter, Duperrey summarises the history of the Islands, and then goes on to describe them, remarking that the monotony of the landscape aroused a profound sadness in the observer. The whaling captains, he said, maintained that the climate of the islands had become warmer. Duperrey describes the dangers and advantages of Berkeley Sound from the mariner's point of view and again refers to Dumont d'Urville for its vegetation. No trace was found of the seeds sown by Bougainville and by the botanist of the <em>Uranie,  </em>Charles Gaudichaud. However, wild horses, cattle, pigs and rabbits had multiplied rapidly. No sign of the native fox was seen. For a description of West Falkland, unvisited by the <em>Coquille </em>, Duperrey cites James <a href=\"/biographies/weddell_james\">WEDDELL</a>; he also relates the story of Captain <a href=\"/biographies/barnard_charles\">BARNARD</a>. Among the fine coloured plates in the atlases of natural history (Paris, 1826) is one of the so-called Antarctic goose, described as <em>Anser antarcticus Vieillt,  </em>les îles Malouines, No. 50.

On 15 October 1877 he became headmaster at the new Woodlane Schools in Fleet, Lincolnshire, where he was accompanied by his mother and five sisters. On 10 April 1882 he was appointed headmaster at Stanley and in May he married Charlotte, also a teacher, before moving to the Falklands.

According to the inscription on his headstone, he first went to sea at the age of ten, taking part in Admiral Lord Hawke's decisive defeat of the French fleet under Admiral Conflans in Quiberon Bay on 20 November 1759. He passed for lieutenant on 14 February 1769, but while awaiting an appointment as a lieutenant, Edgar obtained a passing certificate as a master of a fifth rate from Trinity House on 13 January 1776. This enabled him to join the <em>Discovery </em>as her master on 22 February 1776, serving in her for the whole of <a href=\"/biographies/cook_james\">COOK</a>'s third voyage, during which he was responsible for numerous surveys. Edgar was finally promoted to lieutenant in 30 July 1781. On 6 September 1785 he applied for twelve months leave to command a ship in the merchant service employed in the southern whale fishery. Later that year, on half pay, he sailed for the 'Brazils' as master of the <em>Hope </em>on a whaling and sealing operation which took him to the Falkland Islands. This enabled him to survey West Falkland Island in 1786-7, his survey being published by Aaron Arrowsmith in 1797 with a further edition in 1831. In Falkland Sound, Edgar substituted the name Port Edgar for what had been Port Albemarle on <a href=\"/biographies/byron_john\">BYRON</a>'s survey and Port Albemarle for Port Stephens, moving the latter to its present position west of Cape Meredith. Hope Harbour between Hope Point, the north-west tip of West Falkland and Westpoint Island, is clearly named after Edgar's ship, but Hope Point is a later addition. A note on the chart indicates that in 1786 the <em>Hope  </em>ran aground on one of the Jason Islands<em>. </em></p><p>In 1789, Edgar was appointed naval agent on board the transport <em>Lady Juliana </em>, Captain Aitken, carrying over 200 female convicts to New South Wales. As a result she has been dubbed the floating brothel. During the voyage Edgar was described as a 'kind and humane man', borne out by the fact that only five convicts died on the voyage. He returned to England in the Dutch snow* <em>Waaksamheyd </em>, carrying plants from Governor Phillip for Sir Joseph Banks. In 1794, while serving in the <em>Gorgon </em>, Captain James Wallis, he was reported to be 'a good sailor and navigator, or rather had been, for he drank very hard, so as to entirely ruin his constitution'. From November 1795 until his death on 17 October 1801 Edgar was in charge of Dungeness Signal Tower on Romney Marsh. He is buried in the churchyard of All Saints, Lydd, Kent on the north side of the church.

        "body": "<p>Duke of, Royal visitor, was born on 10 June, 1921, on the Greek island of Corfu, the fifth child and only son of Prince and Princess Andrew of Greece and Denmark. After attending kindergarten school in Paris, he was educated at Cheam preparatory school in England, Salem in south Germany and Gordonstoun in Scotland. He entered the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth in 1939 before being commissioned into the Royal Navy. During World War II he served in the Indian Ocean, the Mediterranean, the North Sea, the Pacific Ocean and Japan. Early in 1947 he renounced his Royal title and became a British subject in order to continue his career in the Royal Navy as Lieutenant Philip Mountbatten. On his marriage to HRH The Princess Elizabeth on 20 November 1947 he was created Duke of Edinburgh with the prefix of His Royal Highness. He continued his naval career, reaching the rank of commander, until it came to an end with the death of King George VI in 1952 and the accession of Queen Elizabeth II.</p><p>The Queen and The Duke of Edinburgh have four children: Charles, Prince of Wales (b1948), Anne, Princess Royal (b1950), Andrew, Duke of York (b1960) and Edward, Earl of Wessex (b1964). They have seven grandchildren.</p><p>After opening the 1956 Olympic Games in Melbourne, the Duke of Edinburgh left Australia on 11 December and sailed from New Zealand on 17 December <em> </em>in HM Yacht  <em>Britannia </em>. He travelled home through the South Atlantic visiting several <em> </em>FIDS bases between 1 and 4 January 1957, the Falkland Islands between 7 and 9 January and South Georgia on 12 January.</p><p>On 31 December Governor Sir Raynor <a href=\"/biographies/arthur_sir\">ARTHUR</a> was flown by helicopter from HMS  <em>Protector </em>to the whale factory ship  <em>Southern Harvester </em>which the Duke was visiting. Returning from  <em>Southern Harvester </em>the party were transferred again by fishing basket from the whale catcher  <em>Sondra </em>which came alongside  <em>Britannia </em>, using a 50 foot sperm whale as a fender. The Duke had the roughest ride as the whaler rolled away just as his basket touched down on the Yacht, but the Bosun kept his head and tipped HRH unceremoniously out onto the deck before the basket was dragged away. On this day, New Year's Eve,  <em>Britannia </em>had crossed the Antarctic Circle at breakfast time and every member of the crew received a Red Nose certificate which was reproduced from a lino cut, designed and made by the artist Edward Seago, who was a guest onboard, and Prince Philip. It was a memorable day for the Duke's two secretaries who were the first British women to cross the Antarctic Circle. From 1 to 4 January the Prince visited the Falkland Islands Dependencies bases in the Antarctic, enjoying for the most part excellent weather.</p><p>After a tranquil crossing of Drake Passage,  <em>Britannia </em>anchored in Stanley harbour at 9 am on Monday 7 January and the Duke, wearing naval uniform and sporting a fair beard which he had been growing since leaving New Zealand, landed by barge at the Public Jetty. Presentations were made by Governor Arthur, Prince Philip inspected a Guard of Honour and walked past the Boys' Brigade and Girls' Life-Brigade on parade and through lines of schoolchildren. After a short stop at Government House he drove in the Governor's London taxicab to the Town Hall, where he replied to an Address of Welcome presented by Les <a href=\"/biographies/hardy_arthur\">HARDY</a>, the Senior Elected Member of LegCo. After a change of clothes at Government House, Prince Philip went to the Racecourse for five races, the highlight of which was the Sailors' Race in which HRH finished first on a horse which had never previously won. As he passed the post the Royal Yacht band played  <em>All the Nice Girls Love a Sailor </em>. Following lunch at Government House he visited the Hospital, Nurses' Home and the Infants' School. Later he arrived at Sapper Hill to see peat cutting and a shooting match between a naval team and one from the Islands. At the Gymnasium he inspected wool, examined horse gear and saw work by spinners, weavers and dyers before planting a tree at Arch Green and visiting the Cathedral. He then returned to  <em>Britannia </em>where he gave a dinner party and later returned to the Town Hall to present prizes to the winners of the various sports and races held over the last two days. The prize-giving was followed by a lively and energetic Ball with music provided by the Royal Yacht band. Prince Philip spent the night at Government House.</p><p>On the morning of Tuesday, 8 January HRH made a 70 minute flight in a FIGAS Beaver seaplane. He flew over the wreck of the SS  <em>Great Britain </em>, and over Port Louis (the first settlement), Darwin School, Goose Green and Fitzroy before returning to Stanley. Later he visited the Racecourse for an exhibition by sheep dogs and also the Meteorological Station. He held an evening reception in  <em>Britannia </em>for 172 people before the Royal Yacht sailed for West Falkland .</p><p>On Wednesday, 9 January  <em>Britannia </em>anchored off Fox Bay and HRH went ashore to see the general set up at Fox Bay East where drafting for shearing was in progress. He then visited the Settlement's new recreation centre, the Government wireless station, the power station and the surgery. After smoko* at the house of the manager, Wick <a href=\"/biographies/clement_howard\">CLEMENT</a>, Prince Philip visited the woolshed to see shearing and baling, returning to a lunch party in  <em>Britannia, </em>before sailing for South Georgia.</p><p>At 9 am on 12 January  <em>Britannia </em>anchored in Leith Harbour, South Georgia, amid magnificent Antarctic scenery on a lovely sunny day. The Duke of Edinburgh and his party went ashore and toured the Salvesen whaling factory before embarking in the whale catcher  <em>Southern Jester </em>(Captain and Master Gunner Nochart NILSEN) for the twenty mile run down the coast to Grytviken, the Pesca station and factory. On the way an old packing case was thrown into the sea and the gunner demonstrated his skill and the gun's capabilities by blowing it to bits at a range of 70 yards. Nilsen, when asked if it was a case of whisky he had fired at, replied 'If it had been I'd have missed'. At Grytviken His Royal Highness re-joined  <em>Britannia </em>and entertained a small party to lunch. Then he went ashore to visit the government station at King Edward Point and saw the Post Office-cum-Customs office, the Radio and the Met Station before walking along the beach to the headland where the plain white cross in memory of Sir Ernest <a href=\"/biographies/shackleton_sir\">SHACKLETON</a> stands. He watched two fin whales being flensed in the factory and then visited Shackleton's grave in the cemetery. When Prince Philip returned on board,  <em>Britannia </em>sailed at high speed to the Bay of Isles where he landed close to the large King and Gentoo Penguin rookeries and spent some time watching these splendid birds. After dark the Royal Yacht sailed for Gough Island.</p><p>Prince Philip sent the following message to the Governor:</p><blockquote><blockquote>As I leave the Falkland Islands and the Dependencies I want you to know how much I have enjoyed the last ten days and the many interesting things I have seen in these Islands.</blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>Please thank the Falkland Islands Legislative Council for their very kind message of farewell on my departure and I would be most grateful if you would express my gratitude and appreciation to all the people who had a hand in making my visit such a pleasant and enjoyable experience, to all the people of the Falkland Islands for their welcome, the leaders and members of the FIDS bases and the whaling companies of South Georgia. I send you all my very best wishes for a happy and prosperous future. Philip</blockquote></blockquote><p>After the 1982 conflict, the Duke of Edinburgh visited the Falkland Islands for a second time between 8 and 13 March, 1991. He carried out a very full civil and military programme throughout his visit but was also able to include a fishing expedition at Chartres on West Falkland and wildlife viewing on Carcass and Pebble Islands.</p><p>The British Antarctic Territory, the Falkland Islands and South Georgia all used scenes from the 1957 royal visit in the stamps they issued in 1977 to celebrate the Queen and Prince Philip's Silver Wedding.</p><p><a href=\"/biographies/pierce-butler_kenelm\">See Image 263</a></p>",

On 30 June 1790 Elizalde took over the governorship from Ramón de <a href=\"/biographies/clairac_y\">CLAIRAC</a>. On relinquishing his post Clairac transmitted to his successor a set of charts and a plan of a basin named El Camello at Puerto de la Soledad, possibly the Careenage, which he had recently surveyed. On 26 August 1790 the brig <em>Carmen y Ánimas </em>was despatched from Buenos Aires to inform Elizalde that Spain was now at war with Britain. On 8 October 1790 Elizalde confirmed to Viceroy Nicolás de Arredondo that the force under his command was maintaining a permanent watch for foreign shipping off the coasts of these islands ready to challenge anyone suspected of surveying or attempting to land under cover of whaling or other fishing activities. In 1791 Elizalde was instructed to proceed in the <em>San Pío </em>accompanied by the brig <em>San Julián </em>, to reconnoitre the waters around Cape Horn and Tierra del Fuego to ascertain that the British had not established any presence in the region. Elizalde was relieved by Pedro <a href=\"/biographies/sanguineto_pedro\">SANGUINETO</a> on 1 March 1791. He began his second term as governor on 1 March 1792 when he relieved Sanguineto, serving until 1 February 1793 when Sanguineto once again relieved him. On 23 January 1793 Elizalde submitted a Plan of Battle to the viceroy, in which he stated that the establishment consisted of 183 individuals, including 35 convicts, organised into three batteries to make use of the defensive possibilities of the terrain. These were San Carlos, with 8 guns, which he commanded, Santiago with 4 guns and San Felipe with 2 guns, each commanded by a commissioned officer. In addition there was a flying squadron on horseback, presumably to ensure speedy liaison between the three batteries.</p>",

He was educated at Marlborough College and New College Oxford. He served in the Indian Army 1942-1946 as a captain in the Frontier Force Rifles.</p><p>In 1948 he joined Christian Salvesen &amp; Co, the shipowning and whaling company, retiring as Chairman in 1988. During that period, after concluding its Antarctic whaling operations in 1966, Salvesen moved into fishing, cold storage and distribution, housing and portable power while retaining its merchant shipping fleet. In South Georgia, Salvesen operated the Leith Harbour land station and offshore the floating factory expeditions <em>Southern Venturer </em>and <em>Southern Harvester </em>. Elliot spent the seasons of 1948/49, 1951/52, 1955/56 and 1958/59 with the floating factory expeditions and at Leith Harbour in the management of the whaling operations, initially under his uncle Harold Salvesen. 1955/56 was a strikingly successful year for the Salvesen fleets which found abundant catch in the Bellinghausen Sea, just opened to whaling by the International Whaling Commission. It was also marked by a visit to Leith Harbour from Vivian <a href=\"/biographies/fuchs_sir\">FUCHS</a> and Edmund Hillary reconnoitring for their transpolar expedition of the following summer. Over these years Salvesen's whaling operations were continuously modernised and extended, with the building of new by-product plants on the factory ships and at Leith Harbour, particularly for meat extract, and the development of Stromness Station for docking and repair of the catcher fleet during the winter. The business was managed from Salvesen's offices in Leith, Scotland and Tønsberg, Norway. Elliot negotiated in 1980 the sale of the Leith Harbour, Stromness and Husvik whaling stations to the Argentine scrap merchant, Constantino Davidoff. The latter did not secure transport to the Island for his dismantling team till two years later, using an Argentine naval ship, at the start of the Falklands War.</p><p>Elliot was concerned as partner, director and chief executive in the development and growth of the company. In fishing Salvesen pioneered with its Fairtry fleet the factory trawler, processing its catch at sea. It also became a leader in industrial fishing with fishmeal plants in Peru, Canada and Ireland. Cold storage units initially set up in Grimsby to store the Fairtry catches expanded over Britain and to the USA and continental Europe. With them was developed refrigerated transport serving food processors and retailers. Salvesen became a public company in 1985, and in 1997 divided into two public companies, Christian Salvesen and Aggreko.</p>",

He volunteered for war service and was commissioned into the Royal Warwickshire Regiment in 1914, and went into battle in France with the ninth platoon of the old Sixth Foot. He was wounded and invalided back to England. It is probable that this was when he lost the lower part of his left arm. He later served in England with the 11th (Garrison) Battalion of the Oxford and Buckingham Light Infantry, being promoted captain in 1918.</p><p>Ellis joined the colonial civil service in 1919, and was chief assistant secretary to the Cyprus Government from 1919 until 1926. He was appointed acting colonial secretary to the Falklands where he arrived in September 1926, succeeding H <a href=\"/biographies/henniker_heaton\">HENNIKER HEATON</a>. He took part in many of the activities of the town, and was chairman of the Entertainment Committee during the visit of HMS <em>Capetown </em>when she visited for the unveiling of the Falkland Islands Battle Memorial in early 1927. In May of that year he was sworn in as acting governor on the departure of Lt Col <a href=\"/biographies/beattie_alexander\">BEATTIE</a>. Governor <a href=\"/biographies/hodson_sir\">HODSON</a> arrived the following month. In August Ellis was appointed colonial secretary.</p><p>In spite of his amputation, Ellis was a sportsman. He is recorded as playing in a cricket match 'Government Officials against the Rest' in January 1927, and he also played hockey. In early 1928 Ellis was among a group who set up the first Girl Guide company in the Falklands, and served on the committee. Ever since his arrival he had been a great supporter of the Falkland Island Defence Force, and in a farewell speech in 1934, Captain Allan said he had 'gone out of his way to assist in whatever manner possible, no matter whether it had been shooting, football or other matters pertaining to the F.I.D.F.' In his reply Ellis said: 'However long I live and wherever I may be I shall always have my roots in the Falkland Islands, and I shall not forget'.</p><p>Ellis's engagement to Molly Clement, daughter of Howard Clement and Mabel, née Bertrand, was announced in March, 1928. In June he broke his leg playing hockey, and had the distinction of being sworn in as acting governor while confined to bed in the King Edward VII Memorial Hospital. They were married in November at Government House by the acting registrar, Capt Amedroz, RN. They had no children. Ellis and his wife lived at Sulivan House, and lost nearly all their possessions in a disastrous fire in July 1929. According to the <em>Falkland Islands Magazine  </em>it was 'only possible to save a few personal things from the back premises'.</p><p>Ellis carried out a huge variety of government tasks during his time in the Falklands. In 1930 he acted as local auditor from May to the end of the year, and as registrar of the Supreme Court from July to the end of the year. In 1931 he administered government from February to June, acted as local auditor and as registrar and magistrate in January.</p><p>In 1933 Ellis was awarded the OBE. He had three war medals and the Jubilee Medal 1935 and Coronation Medal 1937 for his Colonial Office service. He was on leave for the latter half of 1933, and on his return once more became acting governor, as Governor Sir James <a href=\"/biographies/ogrady_sir\">O'GRADY</a> had been taken ill.</p><p>In late September 1934, after eight years in the colony, Ellis left the Falklands to take up his appointment as colonial secretary in Grenada. The local newspaper, the <em>Penguin </em>of 1 October, 1934 reported that: 'A large gathering of Government officials and general public assembled on the Falkland Islands Company's East Jetty landing stage on Saturday morning to bid farewell to His Excellency J.M.Ellis, Esq., O.B.E. on his departure from the Colony'. At this time his wife was in England undergoing medical treatment, and joined him later. They were in Grenada for a year, then in 1935 went to Nyasaland and served there until 1948; from 1941 he was one of the three provincial commissioners in Nyasaland and was based at Blantyre.</p>",

He was ordained in 1924, and served as curate at St John's, Swansea for the following three years, and a further three years at St Martin's, Roath, Cardiff. Evans then moved to South America. In the beginning he served as assistant chaplain at St John's Pro-Cathedral, Buenos Aires, from 1930 to 1935. During that time he was given additional duties: as Bishop <a href=\"/biographies/every_edward\">EVERY</a>'s chaplain (1933-7), and at the same time served as camp chaplain in various parts of the republic. Between 1936 and 1938 he was chaplain serving the parishes of Hurlingham and Villa Devoto in Buenos Aires; he then moved to Río de Janeiro to become vicar of Christ Church (1938-46).</p><p>Evans was consecrated to serve as assistant diocesan bishop on 24 February 1939.

        "body": "<p>horticulturalist, was born in Stanley on 20 January 1914, the fourth of eight children born to John David Evans and Matilda Letitia, née Betts. Evans began his education in Stanley but, on the death of his father in 1927, had to leave school to work at age 14. His mother found him a job as cabin boy on the government vessel <em>Afterglow </em>. His first months at sea he said 'were the worst time of my life'. However a change of master and cook of the vessel brought happier days and increased his love of the sea.</p><p>After six months at sea <em>Afterglow </em>was laid up and his mother found him a gardening, three year un-indentured, apprenticeship at Government House gardens under the head gardener, Cecil Parkinson with an unwritten promise from Governor <a href=\"/biographies/hodson_sir\">HODSON</a> of further training in Britain. After his apprenticeship, no mention was made of the promised training as Hodson had been replaced by Governor <a href=\"/biographies/ogrady_sir\">O'GRADY</a>. Parkinson departed leaving his position vacant but, although now fully qualified, Evans was not to fill the vacancy. With a new governor, Sir Herbert <a href=\"/biographies/henniker_heaton\">HENNIKER HEATON</a>, a petition was submitted by the Falkland Islands Reform League that Evans be appointed acting head gardener. The governor, guided by his own assessment, appointed Evans acting head gardener. He also renewed the promise of training once arrangements could be made, and in 1937 Evans and family duly departed for Britain. Evans completed one year training at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew and a further year at the West of Scotland Agricultural College Horticultural Department, Auchincruive, Scotland. He returned to Government House gardens as head gardener in 1939 on a salary of two hundred pounds per annum. Thus began a very successful career in the Falklands, and later horticultural research in West and East Africa.</p><p>Evans married Mabel Eliza (May) Middleton, a housemaid at Government House, on 4 December 1932 in Stanley. They had four children: Denton John, (b1933), Howell Alistair (b1937), Marcia Joan (b1938) and Darrell (b1946). He had also been an active member of the Boys Brigade and, in earlier years, as a Rover Sea Scout (1936) and had been taught, examined and certificated for his competency in sailing.</p><p>One of Evans's many projects was the growing of trees in the Falklands. For his initial experiment, he planted two plantations of trees behind the government gardens; these were eventually to act as a shelter break against the westerly winds - subsequently they became known in Stanley as 'The Forest'. During World War II he was withdrawn from active military service with the Falkland Islands Defence Force, in which he served for a period of 15 years as a corporal, and called upon, with his staff, to produce massive quantities of vegetables for the British forces stationed in Stanley and for visiting naval and merchant vessels. In July 1946, Dr <a href=\"/biographies/gibbs_james\">GIBBS</a>, in charge of the Agricultural Department, left the Islands. Evans was then appointed officer-in-charge of the Agriculture Department, in addition to supervising Government House gardens on a salary of £437 pa.</p><p>Shortly after the end of World War II Evans applied to the Colonial Office in London for an overseas posting as he wanted a better education for his children and also because the colony did not offer further advancement in his profession. In March 1947 he departed, on his own, aboard the <em>Northumberland </em>, his family remaining in Stanley. He took up a horticultural position at the Cocoa Research Institute at Tafo, Gold Coast, {Ghana}. Toward the end of his contract time he applied successfully for a position as an assistant horticultural officer at the Coffee Research Station, Ruiru, Kenya. He was reunited with his family in the UK before they all sailed out to Kenya, where they happily remained, he in various other horticultural research units (pineapples and citrus), until Kenyan independence in 1963. He had also served in the Kenya Police Reserve, on active duty during the Mau Mau uprising.</p><p>With their son Darrell they migrated to New Zealand, where their eldest son and his family lived. Evans had a varied life style in Auckland: he gave up horticulture completely and bought a grocery shop. However he and his wife were too successful and the business became too demanding so he sold it and worked for the Inland Revenue before getting work with local government. During retirement he revived his love of the sea and thoroughly enjoyed his sailing for as long as he was able. He attained first his boat-master's certificate and finally his coastal yacht-master's certificate, gaining the required sea time on his son's yacht.</p><p>Evans, for the most part, thoroughly enjoyed his life as a seaman and as a Falkland Island and African horticulturalist. He was a short, slight man with a strong will, and a happy disposition although, when antagonised, he had a 'short fuse'. In his grim determination to better himself and his family, he was ably supported by his equally determined wife. He was always very conscious of his lack of secondary and tertiary education, but his ability to learn on the job brought him the success and happiness he had worked so hard for and so richly deserved.

        "body": "<p>topographic surveyor, was born in Aberystwyth on 20 March 1932, the second son of David J M Evans and Nellie, née Barker. He was educated at Ardwyn County Grammar School and University College of Wales, Aberystwyth, obtaining a BSc degree in geography in 1952. For national service between 1952-54 he was posted to Air Plans Section, RAF Ismailia in the Suez Canal Zone. On demobilisation he joined the Directorate of Colonial Surveys (DCS) as a colonial probationer at the School of Military Survey, Hermitage, Berkshire for 12 months of intensive practical field training. (The title DCS was changed to Directorate of Overseas Surveys (DOS) in June 1957).</p><p>In October 1956 Evans' first posting was to north western Uganda where he took part in the observing of the primary triangulation scheme between the borders of Sudan, the (then Belgian) Congo and the empty lands of the Elephant Sanctuary. This tour was followed by a posting to the Falklands. He arrived in Stanley on the RRS <em>John Biscoe </em>on 26 November 1957 joining George Reid, a senior DOS surveyor who had already arrived in August on the maiden voyage of the RMS <em>Darwin </em>. The Falklands was the last major classical triangulation scheme undertaken by DOS before the introduction of electronic measuring equipment in the late 1950s, and the field survey of the Falklands for 1:50,000 mapping followed the complete air photo cover flown in 1956.</p><p>Ideal weather conditions for angular observations by theodolite were rare, the wind being a constant enemy. It was necessary to camp close to most triangulation stations in order to take advantage of any break in the weather which might occur. Few such stations were completed in less than a week, while several required up to three weeks camping on the highest hills in adverse conditions of wind, low cloud, rain and snow. Both surveyors worked as individual units each with the invaluable help of an Islands horseman. Observations were completed on East Falkland in December 1958, Evans working south of the line Mt Usborne/Mt Kent while Reid completed to the north. On West Falkland, Evans observed the area from Westpoint to Fox Bay while Reid took the southern camps and islands. The Land Rover was invaluable over Lafonia and much of the West, while horse travel with  <em>cargeros*  </em>was necessary on most of the major hills and wet Camp. Most of the available small ships, both farm vessels and the MV <em>Philomel, </em>were used to visit offshore islands. In December 1959, HMS  <em>Protector' </em>s helicopters made it possible to complete the survey of the Jason Islands in two days as part of a training exercise with FIDS* surveyors on their way to Antarctic bases.</p><p>Generous Falklands hospitality was a feature of life, from a smoko* in passing on the track to extended stays with managers and shepherds alike. Likewise help with workshops, stores and grazing for the horses. Place names for the maps as well as fence lines and gates not discernible on the air photos were collected on these occasions and while in Stanley during the winter months of July and August. These interludes made up for the rigours of camping in tents and the relative luxuries of shanties and empty houses. Observations on the West were completed in April 1960. Evans left Stanley in May 1960 and Reid a month later. The 29 1:50,000 maps were published by DOS in 1962.</p><p>Evans was posted to Northern Ghana in 1960-63. Further postings were as senior surveyor to the Solomon Islands in 1963-67, to Guyana in 1967-69, to Ethiopia in 1970-72 and 1975-76, to the West Indies in 1972-75, then as principal surveyor to Malawi in 1978-81 and finally in 1981-1989 as survey adviser to the (North) Yemen Survey Department.</p><p>In 1962 Evans married Barbara Elsie Herriot Goldie, a marine biologist, who with their family of two sons and a daughter accompanied Evans on all his subsequent overseas postings.</p>",

After gaining his degree at Trinity College, Cambridge, he was ordained in the Church of England in 1885 in the Diocese of Durham.</p><p>His qualities of leadership and sympathetic character, which emerged during 17 years' work in the north of England, his interest in the mission field and the fact that he was single, marked him out as a most suitable candidate for the vacant bishopric of the Falkland Islands. He was consecrated on 13 July 1902. On his arrival in South America, he quickly realised that there had to be a division of the territorially vast diocese under his care. This took place in 1910; the result was that he became Bishop in Argentina and Eastern South America, and a new bishop, Laurence <a href=\"/biographies/blair_laurence\">BLAIR</a>, was appointed to the Falkland Islands and the West Coast countries. However, with the resignation of Bishop <a href=\"/biographies/blair_laurence\">BLAIR</a> in 1914, Every resumed responsibility for the two dioceses for the years of World War I until the appointment of Bishop DE JERSEY.</p><p>In his book <em>South American Memories of Thirty Years </em>, Every describes two of the visits he made to the Falkland Islands. The first was in 1916 when he was travelling on a Pacific Steam Navigation Company (PSNC) ship travelling between Montevideo and the West Coast. He was present at the lecture in the Stanley town hall by Ernest <a href=\"/biographies/shackleton_sir\">SHACKLETON</a>, who had only the previous day, on 31 May, reached Stanley from Elephant Island and South Georgia. The other visit he recounts was his final one to the Islands. It took place before the end of World War I, when the numbers of ships calling at the Islands was at a low ebb. Every found himself inadvertently stranded in the Islands for over three months, having arrived on the last PSNC steamer to call before the curtailment of the PSNC service. He describes the people he met and their farms on a visit he made to both East and West Falkland.</p><p>After a long, distinguished episcopate Every retired from his duties in South America in 1937, and became rector of Egginton, Derbyshire and assistant bishop.

        "body": " <p>fifth viscount, was born at Farley Castle, Somerset on 15 February 1656 and baptised at Great Tew, Oxon eleven days later. He was the only son of Henry Carey, fourth Viscount Falkland and his wife Rachael, daughter of Anthony Hungerford of Black Bourton, Oxon. He succeeded to the title on 2 April 1663. He was educated at Winchester College from 1668 and then at Christ Church Oxford, which he left in 1672. In 1681 Falkland married Rebecca , daughter of Sir Rowland Lytton of Knebworth, Herts; their only child Harriet died in infancy. His wife's fortune enabled him to purchase for £15,000 the post of treasurer of the Navy, which he held from June 1681 to November 1689. He occupied theTreasurer's house at Deptford dockyard, where the diarist John Evelyn, his neighbour at Sayes Court, sometimes dined with him, noting once that 'afterwards we had rare musique'.</p><p>Falkland was MP for Oxfordshire (1685-1688), Marlow, Bucks (1689-1690) and Great Bedwyn, Wilts (1690-1694). He was appointed to the Board of Admiralty in January 1691 and then first Lord of the Admiralty in the commission of 15 April 1693.</p><p>Falkland made a very profitable investment, with other speculators in an enterprise to find the Spanish treasure ship <em>Concepción </em>, wrecked off Hispaniola. The <em>James and Mary </em>with John <a href=\"/biographies/strong_john\">STRONG</a> as chief mate, brought the treasure into Deal on 7 June 1687. It included gold, pearls, gems and 32 tons of silver pieces of eight; Falkland's one-seventh share of it was £21,766. However he lost £19,000 on two subsequent ventures. Captain Strong received a royal commission, commanded the <em>Welfare </em>and sailed in 1689 with 90 men and boys and good divers in search of another wrecked Spanish treasure ship, which he failed to find. (Its estimated value when eventually located in 1997 was £2·5 billion.) In April 1690, Strong landed on West Falkland, naming the passage between the islands, Falkland's Sound, in honour of Viscount Falkland, then first Lord of the Admiralty and one of his financial backers.</p><p>In January 1694 Falkland was accused of bribing members of parliament out of the fund for Admiralty perquisites, was reprimanded and committed to the Tower of London by a vote of the House of Commons on 16 February 1694, but released three days later. King William III appointed him as his envoy to the Hague, but before Falkland could take up the post he died of smallpox, aged 38 on 24 May 1694; he was buried four days later in Westminster Abbey. His widow died aged 47 on 30 September 1709 and was buried in St Paul's Cathedral. Evelyn noted:</p><blockquote><blockquote>My Lord Falkland (grandson to the learned Lord Falkland, secretary of state to K. Charles I, and slaine in his service) died now of the small pox: he was a pretty, briske, understanding and industrious young gent: had formerly been faulty, but now much reclaimed. Had the fortune to marry a great fortune, besides fortunately intitled to a vast sum, being his share of the Spanish wrack, taken up at the expense of divers Adventurers; was now from a Scotch Viscount made an English Baron; had been Treasurer of the Navy &amp; advancing extreamely in the new Court: All this now gon in a moment ...</blockquote></blockquote>",

        "body": " <p>Jesuit priest and author, was born on 6 October 1707 in Manchester, the son of Thomas Falkner an apothecary. He studied medicine in London and mathematics and physics under Isaac Newton. In 1730 he arrived in Buenos Aires as a ship's surgeon on board a slaving vessel. Falling seriously ill, he was much cared for by a Jesuit priest and converted to Catholicism. He entered the Society of Jesus in Paraguay in 1732 and was ordained in 1739. He worked initially in Paraguay and then in Santiago del Estero, Tucumán, Córdoba and Santa Fé. He studied Indian dialects and in 1748 joined Fr Matias Strobel on an expedition to Río Negro. He lived on horseflesh and used his hat for a plate, which because of its greasy condition was eaten by wild dogs while he was asleep. By 1756 Falkner had moved to Córdoba and it is probable that he occupied the new chair of mathematics in that city.</p><p>After the expulsion of the Jesuits from Argentina in 1767, Falkner sailed for England on the Swedish ship  <em>Venus </em>in January 1768 and became chaplain successively to Robert Berkeley at Winsley, Herefordshire and the Plowdens at Plowden Hall, Shropshire. It was while living with the Plowden family that he died on 30 January 1784 and was buried at Lydbury North, Shropshire.</p><p>His book  <em>A Description of Patagonia, and the adjoining parts of South America ... and some Particulars relating to Falkland's Islands </em>was published in Hereford in 1774. The Preface to this book places its composition in the context of the contemporary dispute between Britain and Spain over the Islands, and rather quixotically urges an alliance between the two countries. But only three of the book's 144 pages are devoted to 'Falkland's Islands': Falkner had not visited the Islands himself but had received accounts from Spanish officers who had 'received' the country from the French in 1767 and from a French gunner who was a fellow passenger on the  <em>Venus </em>. The account is thoroughly depressing and indeed Falkner maintains that <a href=\"/biographies/bougainville_louis\">BOUGAINVILLE</a> had intended to abandon his settlement at Port Louis, but had tricked the Spaniards into paying compensation for making it over to them. Falkner's work contains much interesting information on the South American Indians, derived from his missionary work among them, and is considered a classic. It was used by Charles <a href=\"/biographies/darwin_charles\">DARWIN</a> on the voyage of the <em>Beagle </em>.</p>",

        "body": "<p>American explorer and sealer, was born in Stonington, Connecticut, on 16 July 1769, son of Gilbert Fanning and his wife Hulda, née Palmer. He was named after his uncle, the British General Edmund Fanning and went to sea as a cabin boy at the age of 14 in 1783 and, like his older brother Nathaniel of American Revolutionary War fame, was connected to the sea in one manner or another for the rest of his life</p><p>Fanning reached the rank of mate by the age of 21 and when he first visited the South Shetlands in 1792 as first mate aboard a sealing vessel his fate became inextricably linked with the tremendously profitable sealing industry and trade with China. A single cargo of skins from the Juan Fernandez Islands on the brig <em>Betsey </em>in 1798 resulted in trade goods that eventually sold for more than US$120,000 (equal to approximately US$1·6 million in present value). His personal share of the cargo was $15,000. It has been claimed that the sealing business seemed more like a gold rush when news of this voyage reached the east coast of America leading eventually to the decimation and near extinction of the seal population on the Falklands and other islands along the South American coast.</p><p>Fanning recognized the potential of the Chinese market and understood the Chinese thirst for natural products that could be harvested from the sea for a relatively small investment. <em>Bêche de mer* </em>, pearls and the like would, he believed, more than pay for the cost of any expedition mounted by the United States. In 1812 President James Madison put Fanning in command of two ships which could have realized his dream of leading an expedition to the South Seas. It was not to be. War with England broke out and the expedition never got fully underway. While he participated in additional voyages for profit, his wish to participate in a major voyage of discovery went unfulfilled.</p><p>Fanning continued to broker voyages and his familiarity with the Falklands led him to send his son, William, as supercargo* aboard the brig <em>Hersilia </em>in 1819 in pursuit of furs and new islands to the east and south of the Falklands. Nathaniel Palmer, the 21 year old mariner eventually credited as a discoverer of Antarctica in 1820, was reportedly put ashore on Kidney Island in the Falklands with a couple of crewmen to gather provisions for the <em>Hersilia </em>. During his month on Kidney Island, Palmer became familiar with a crew member from an Argentine ship who told him of land to the south. Once the <em>Hersilia </em>returned to Stonington and informed Fanning of their discoveries he, along with his son William, set about organizing an expedition to take advantage of the situation. In addition to the <em>Hersilia </em>, Fanning and company sent out the schooner <em>Express </em>and the little sloop <em>Hero </em>, captained by Palmer. After stopping for 10 days in Berkeley Sound in the Falklands, Palmer set out on what would become his historic voyage of discovery. Both Fanning and the Falklands played a critical role in this controversial discovery.</p><p>The next expedition to the South mounted by Fanning in 1829 was a financial disaster and he attempted more than once to claim reimbursement from the United States Congress but he was rebuffed on each occasion. This did not, however, dampen his spirits for exploration. Some claim that the Wilkes Exploring Expedition of 1838-42 was a direct result of the publication of Fanning's <em>Voyages Round the World </em>in 1833. While he was not invited to participate in this expedition, he did petition Congress once more for funds in 1840 in hopes of leading his own expedition. Congress turned him down and he died at the age of 71 the next year on 23 April 1841 in New York, following his wife to the grave by less than one week.</p><p>Fanning played the roles of mariner, explorer, businessman, propagandist and investor in his pursuit of exploiting the far-flung reaches of the world's oceans for personal and national gain. He has given his name to Fanning Head on East Falkland and Fanning Island in the Pacific.</p>",

He went to sea in the merchant service at an early age and later after entering the Royal Navy served as a midshipman in <em>Dreadnought  </em>in the West Indies and in <em>Achilles </em>on the home station. From 1759 to 1761 he was lieutenant on <em>Aurora </em>, after which he was placed on half pay and settled in Norwich. Here he met and married his wife Rebecca Fleming, a naval captain's daughter: the couple had nine children. In 1766 he is said to have given valuable help in suppressing a riot and, thanks to the commendation of the Norwich magistrates, he was promoted commander in 1767.</p><p>In September 1769 he was appointed to the sloop <em>Swift </em>and set out for the Falkland Islands. Arriving in March 1770, he found that the Spaniards established at Puerto Soledad (Port Louis) had peremptorily ordered the British garrison at Port Egmont to quit the Islands. As there was no British force to resist any aggression, the senior officer Commander Anthony <a href=\"/biographies/hunt_anthony\">HUNT</a> determined to go to England with the news, leaving Farmer in command. A few days later the <em>Swift </em>sailed for a cruise round the Islands; in a violent gale she was blown over to the coast of Patagonia and in attempting to enter Port Desire {Puerto Deseado} struck a rock and was utterly lost. The crew escaped to the shore, but as they were entirely destitute, Farmer dispatched the cutter to Port Egmont with orders to the only remaining ship, <em>Favourite </em>, to come to their relief. On 16 April the party arrived safely at Port Egmont. On 4 June 1770 a Spanish frigate anchored in the harbour, presently followed by four others. Their commander, Don Juan Ignacio <a href=\"/biographies/madariaga_juan\">MADARIAGA</a>, wrote to Farmer that, having with him 1600 troops and a train of artillery, he was in a position to compel the British to quit, if they hesitated any longer. Farmer replied that he would defend himself to the best of his power; but resistance against such an overwhelming force could be no more that complimentary, and accordingly when the Spaniards landed, Farmer, after firing his guns, capitulated on terms. An inventory of the stores was taken and the British were permitted to return home in the <em>Favourite </em>.</p><p>After arriving home in September 1770, Farmer was acquitted of all blame for the loss of the <em>Swift </em>, appointed to the sloop <em>Tamar </em>and in 1771 promoted captain. In 1773 he sailed to the East Indies in command of the frigate <em>Seahorse </em>(with Horatio Nelson as one of his midshipmen). Farmer was a poor leader and <em>Seahorse </em>was not a happy ship. During the American war he was in command of the frigate <em>Quebec </em>, and, based in Guernsey, he destroyed a French coastal convoy on 6 July 1779. But his ship was damaged and after repairs, in which his lost cannon had been replaced with smaller guns, he confronted the large French frigate <em>Surveillante </em>on 6 October. After a long and bloody action the <em>Quebec </em>caught fire and exploded; Farmer and most of his crew perished. The Admiralty were so impressed by Farmer's 'stubborn gallantry' that they recommended that a baronetcy be conferred on his eldest son George-William.</p>",

        "body": "<p>farmer and naturalist, was born on 17 December 1854 in Stanley, the tenth child of Henry <a href=\"/biographies/felton_henry\">FELTON</a> and his wife Martha, née Staples. Several of Henry Felton's sons took to farming, either in the Falklands, or in Patagonia, where more land was readily available, or in Australia. Arthur Felton probably gained his farming knowledge in Camp on his brother-in-law William Wickham BERTRAND's land at Roy Cove. West Point Island was included in the leased Roy Cove farm, and was uninhabited except for plentiful wildlife, the wildest of all being the cattle placed ashore by seal and penguin hunters for fresh meat supplies. It was a favoured anchorage for roving ship's crews who had free access to fresh water and even grew potatoes. Felton took over the lease of West Point Island in 1879 when he was in his mid twenties, living in a tiny stone hut probably built by sealers. He did not have money to spare and considered building a woolshed to be his priority. When the woolshed foundations were being built, several bodies were discovered, having being roughly buried several years before, presumably sailors who had died of scurvy or some other 'cause'. They were re-buried elsewhere.</p><p>Felton busied himself building the structures and amenities necessary for his sheep farm. A programme of basic fencing was begun, a well dug, and gardens started, to provide much needed fresh produce. Cows would have been tamed from the wild herd to provide milk and butter, and sheep brought from the mainland in small boats. This was all hard work and probably a very lonely lifestyle. In January 1882, Commander William <a href=\"/biographies/wiseman_william\">WISEMAN</a> wrote graphically to his wife about a hunt for wild cattle on West Point with Arthur Felton and his brother George (who was his business partner at the time). Until the wild cattle were killed off, building fences would have been a waste of time, as the cattle would have trampled them down. The cattle were also ruining the remaining tussac ( <em>Poa flabellata </em>) fringes round the north of the Island.</p><p>Felton must have had some respite from his labours to court (Elizabeth) Lily Whaits, whose father was catechist and joiner for the Patagonian Mission Station on nearby Keppel Island. Lily was living at the Mission Station at Ushuaia before her marriage to Arthur, and would have suffered a winter sea voyage to Stanley for the wedding which was held in Holy Trinity Church on 31 July 1884.</p><p>He had a great interest in natural history, farming and agriculture. His energy and insight into improving the pasture of West Point was to pay dividends. Not only did he labour hard to plant thousands of small tussac plants in various locations on the Island, he top sowed several more palatable grasses which grew well, replacing White Grass ( <em>Cortaderia pilosa </em>) and most of the Diddle Dee ( <em>Empetrum rubrum </em>). This ensured very good grade wool which brought Felton high prices. The large gardens on West Point produced a flourishing variety of hardy fruits and berries, vegetables, shrubs, trees and flowers. A self-sufficient and thriving farm was established, with the Felton family, increased by this time by the birth of a daughter Alice Emma in 1886. An additional family would be in residence, employed to help with a variety of farm work.</p><p>Felton was viewed with some derision initially because of his insistence on the importance of tussock as a winter feed for animals, and on the good management of vegetation for sheep grazing. He was passionate about the care and management of local wildlife, especially after the imported cats on West Point exterminated the few rabbits there and many of the small birds. Many naturalists visited the Feltons on West Point, among them the Swedish scientist Carl <a href=\"/biographies/skottsberg_carl\">SKOTTSBERG</a> who wrote:</p><blockquote><blockquote>Mr Felton approximates very nearly to my ideal man. Ready to enjoy life and civilization when there is a chance, he nevertheless lives in complete harmony with the wild camp life; he is interested in his work, he tries all sorts of grasses for his sheep, but is also - an exception to the general rule - intensely fond of nature itself and is gifted with such and gifted to such a remarkable capacity for observation that many a naturalist by profession has reason to envy him. He knows every beast or plant on his island; he loves and nurses them, quite convinced that the human race can live at its ease without depriving living things which do him no harm of any chance of existence. I have never met anybody but him who tries to save one of the Falklands' finest adornments, the giant tussock grass which is nearly extinct whenever there are sheep, much to the detriment of the coast's appearance.</blockquote></blockquote><p>ER <a href=\"/biographies/gunther_eustace\">GUNTHER</a> visiting on the Discovery Expedition in the 1920s, describes how Felton, having been reading late into the night, woke him by tickling his nose with a piece of paper, the former being highly amused by the prank. They drank coffee at dawn, and then Felton sent his guest off to the mollymawk rookery to collect eggs for breakfast. Governor <a href=\"/biographies/allardyce_sir\">ALLARDYCE</a> writing to the Colonial Office in 1909 called Felton one of the most successful and progressive sheep farmers of the Colony, although he had only 2,500 sheep. With extensive tussock paddocks wherever the plants would flourish, he had judiciously fenced off the land into small sections and his sheep had clipped a heavier than average fleece than any farmer in the Falkland Islands. He was appointed a Justice of the Peace in 1904.</p><p>In 1910 Carl Skottsberg was sent a specimen of a plant which Felton had found in 1895 and 1898 at the end of a stone run on the Island. He had brought home some seeds which had been planted in the garden and then accidentally covered with clay. This had been removed some years later and the seeds had then germinated. The flower, which Skottsberg described as  <em>Calandrinia feltonii </em>was an annual with only one close relation,  <em>Calandrini axilliflora </em>which grew in Chile. The 'Felton Flower' as it has become known, had petals varying from white through to a bright, shiny cerise colour. Unfortunately sheep have eaten the original plants out on West Point, but over the years they have thrived well in many private gardens and trial plantings have been made in and around stone runs. The flowers have also featured on Falkland postage stamps, keeping Arthur Felton's name alive.</p><p>In 1932 Felton left West Point and his final months were spent in his 'Sunny Bungalow', which he had built in Stanley only a few months before. He died in 1933 and was buried in Stanley. The lease of West Point passed to his daughter Alice. In the  <em>Falkland Islands Magazine and Church Paper  </em>of July 1933, a lengthy obituary noted:</p><blockquote><blockquote>Botany, Natural History, Meteorology, Geology - all were within his scope of knowledge and he could not only talk profoundly on these subjects to the casual listener but demonstrated his thoroughness in them by association with the learned men in these spheres of science. In 1912 he was elected a member of the Arts and Crafts Society in London and a fellow of the Royal Meteorological Society.</blockquote></blockquote><p>The obituary admired his generosity, sense of humour and fund of unlimited anecdotes and his 'loathing for animosities, backbiting and scandal - the petty smacks that are apt to form too large a part of the conversation of people in small communities'.</p>",

He lived on the family farm at Teal Inlet, East Falklands and later became manager of the farm.</p><p>On 13 April 1901 Felton married Winifred, the American daughter of JE <a href=\"/biographies/rowen_john\">ROWEN</a>, who was the (career) United States consul in the Falkland Islands. They went back to Teal Inlet after their wedding, but unfortunately their wedding presents, which were following on the ill fated <em>Thetis, </em>disappeared with that ship, never to be seen again. Another misfortune befell the Feltons, when the Manager's House at Teal Inlet burnt down and a new house had to be built.  As if misfortune had not visited this family enough, when returning to the Islands on the Royal Mail Ship <em>Oravia </em>, she struck the Billy Rock outside Stanley and the new furniture for their house at Teal Inlet went to the bottom with the ship. The Feltons produced 3 children, Louis Rowen (b1902), Dorothy Iowa (b1906) and Eileen Constance (b1914). Eileen Constance described her father as 'a very large, tall man and a typical farm manager of the time...' and referring to domestic schedules and breakfast in particular, 'my father was one of the 8 o'clock on the dot type'.</p><p> Felton was appointed as a Justice of the Peace in 1911 and a member of LegCo in 1923 and again in 1924. The Feltons spent their winters in the house in Stanley, (built by his father <strong>JJ Felton and </strong>called 'Malvina' after his daughter) where the social life was quite hectic. This is where they lived after retiring from the farm in the winter of 1943. Unfortunately Jack Felton died several months later on 28 September that same year, and was buried in Stanley cemetery. Winifred Felton died in January 1945; she too is buried in Stanley cemetery.</p>",

        "body": "<p>soldier and patriarch, was born in the Parish of St. George's, Hanover Square, London in 1798, the youngest son of William Felton, coach maker, and Sara. The four Felton children were said to have ridden in the first steam carriage ever to run in London, in 1803, as their father had made the bodywork. Henry Felton's military records state that he was an apprentice to a coachmaker before enlisting in the Second Regiment of the Life Guards in 1820. Tall, grey-eyed, with a fair complexion and brown hair (according to his military records), he served as a private initially, before being promoted to corporal of horse in 1823, and to troop corporal major in 1835. In 1844, having served 24 years and 187 days with no service abroad, he was discharged from the Life Guards with a persistent pain in the left side, attributed to a bout of jaundice contracted in 1833, which hampered his riding duties. His discharge testimonials showed Felton to be excellent, honest, trustworthy, sober and keeping his troop in excellent condition.</p><p>On his discharge, aged 45 years, Felton emerged from Regents Park Barracks with a ruddy complexion and a pension of two shillings a day. A further testimonial signed by several inhabitants of Windsor endorsed the good character references of the Life Guards. In 1838 Felton and Martha Ann Staples, of 2 Cross Street, London were married at St Martin in the Fields in London. Her father was an 'oilman' or paint manufacturer and possibly the two met through their fathers' businesses. Their marriage produced seven children, born in England: Henry (b1840), John James <a href=\"/biographies/felton_john\">FELTON</a> (b1841), Martha Ellen (b1842), Norah (b1844), Catherine Beatrice (b1845), Alice (b1847), and Charles (b1849). Some family sources believe he may have been a publican or hotelier in Windsor after he left the army.</p><p>At this time in the Falklands, Stanley was being established and pioneer settlers of good character and with some form of military training were needed in the young colony. The cheapest solution was to enlist retired soldiers - military <a href=\"/biographies/pensioners_the\">PENSIONERS</a> - from Britain whose wives were to be experienced in domestic, dairy and gardening tasks so that families would be self-supporting. There was no shortage of such men and their families, prepared to face the long voyage and the pioneering hardships on arrival. Felton was over the required age for volunteers and had more children than was deemed suitable. But the Feltons were accepted and he was given the rank of sergeant major under Captain Reid, who commanded the thirty pensioners.</p><p>On 13 October 1849, the merchant ship <em>Victory </em>sailed into Stanley with the pensioners and their families, a total of 120 people. Prefabricated cottages were brought out for the pensioners and overseeing their erection on Pioneer Row and Drury Street was one of Felton's responsibilities. Despite difficult times for these families, the Feltons stayed on in the Falklands and Martha produced seven more children: Madeline (b1850), Walter (b1851), Arthur Ernest <a href=\"/biographies/felton_arthur\">FELTON</a> (b1853), Herbert Stanley (b1855), George Oscar (b1857), Randolph (b1860) and Matilda (b1862). The Pioneer Row house became too small for the family very quickly, so Felton became publican at the 'Queens Arms' in Stanley (later the 'Stanley Arms') and the family lived there.</p><p>When Reid left, Felton became officer in charge of the pensioners and of the local militia. He served as a Justice of the Peace and as a member of ExCo, but no dates appear for these appointments. He died in 1876 at the grand age of 79 years, followed by his wife aged 66 years, in 1880. They are buried side by side in the Stanley cemetery. A stamp issue of 1994 to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the founding of Stanley features Henry Felton on the 35 pence stamp.</p>",

After several years as clerk or accountant for the Falkland Islands Company and then Dean Brothers in Stanley, in 1871 Felton applied for the lease of the land known as Teal Inlet on East Falklands. His application was successful and he began the difficult task of establishing a sheep farm on what he later called 'Evelyn Station' after his eldest daughter.</p><p>On 24 September 1870 in Holy Trinity Church Stanley he married Sara Turner, whose father Isaac Turner, a market gardener, arrived in the Falklands in 1868. Sara was about 18 years old. The Feltons had seven children: Evelyn Mary (b1871), Lillian Gertrude (b1873), Winifred Irene (Nellie) (b1875), Viola Constance (b1877), George John (Jack) <a href=\"/biographies/felton_george\">FELTON</a> (b1879), Malvina Nathalia (b1881) and Roy Stanley (b1883).</p><p>'JJ' as he was commonly known was a very successful and respected sheepfarmer and he had built up a small community of families on the farm by the time he retired to Stanley. He was appointed a Justice of the Peace in 1888 and in 1902 was also appointed a member of Executive Council. The Feltons built 'Malvina House' in Stanley in the 1880s, named after their youngest daughter. This house was to be the social hub for many naval visitors, and other young men who were attracted to the vivacious daughters. (The original house has been demolished and another built, but one of the conservatories remains).</p><p>His obituary in the <em>Falkland Islands Magazine &amp; Church Paper </em>of 1911 describes how:</p><blockquote><blockquote>For many years his tall figure was to be seen daily, working at his house and garden in which he took so much pride, and it was only when his children all of whom are married, one by one left the old home for homes of his own that he began to take numerous journeys to England.</blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>In the year 1905 Mr Felton's eyesight which had become defective from years of hard work at books, somewhat suddenly failed and he paid visits to leading oculists in England and Germany, only to learn that all they could do was preserve what little sight was left to him. This meant giving up riding, smoking and reading, the latter especially a severe loss but he unfortunately became the subject of severe headaches as well. Only those who have had similar misfortunes can realize what all this meant, but it was met with dogged determination which never left him even to the last.</blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>Mr Felton's last visit to Stanley was in 1909. He had, we think, fully hoped to end his days here, but his general health became so bad that he decided to return to England for the best advice procurable. When it was known that he was suffering from cancer, it was evident that the end was not far distant.</blockquote></blockquote><p>John James Felton died in Weymouth, Dorset in 1911.</p>",

        "body": "<p>German surveyor and geodesist (South Georgia), was born into a family of forest superintendents at Munich, Germany on 13 September 1877. In 1900, as a military cadet, he used a three-month leave for a spectacular ride over the Pamir Mountains. Afterwards he studied surveying and geography at the Technical University of Munich and had further practical education in geophysics at various military and civil institutions in preparation for his second expedition to Tibet and western China in 1903-1905, which he undertook together with his wife and the physician and geographer Albert Tafel. During this expedition Filchner found difficulty working with a scientist on an equal basis, because as an officer he was trained to command and not to discuss.</p><p>Filchner organised and led the Second German South Polar Expedition to investigate the region south of the Weddell Sea. After a training expedition to Spitzbergen in 1910, the expedition's ship <em>Deutschland </em>left Hamburg without Filchner on 3 May 1911 and arrived in Buenos Aires on 7 September. Personal problems between expedition members were already apparent when Filchner finally embarked. He caused even more problems, not being used to life on board ship, because he could not accept that he came under the command of the captain. <em>Deutschland </em>left Buenos Aires on 4 October. The expedition arrived in Grytviken, South Georgia on 21 October to take on a load of Cardiff coal and to prepare for the Weddell Sea voyage. The doctor Ludwig Kohl (later <a href=\"/biographies/kohl-larsen_ludwig\">KOHL-LARSEN)</a> had to leave the expedition to recover from an appendicitis operation. During his stay, Filchner became good friends with the leader of the whaling station of the Compania Argentina de Pesca, Carl Anton <a href=\"/biographies/larsen_carl\">LARSEN</a>, who put his sealing steamer <em>Undine </em>at Filchner's disposal. Filchner used <em>Undine </em>from 24-30 October and 22-29 November to make a coastal survey during a circumnavigation of South Georgia and a research trip to the South Sandwich Islands, where he could not land due to bad weather. Between these voyages the expedition lost its third officer Walter Slossarczyk, who did not come back from a trip in a small boat in Cumberland Bay. A memorial cross was erected uphill from the Grytviken cemetery. During additional excursions, investigations of the geological structure of South Georgia and the degree of glacier cover were made. A rock collection, including a fossil ammonite, was later used to support the hypothesis that South Georgia is part of the fold mountains of the South American Andes and those of the Antarctic Peninsula.</p><p>The expedition also visited Karl <a href=\"/biographies/schrader_carl\">SCHRADER</a>'s former German station at Royal Bay, where Erich Przybyllok, astronomer and earth magnetician, determined the changes of magnetic field since 1882-3 and took meteorological measurements to compare with data from the Argentine weather station at King Edward Point and the data, which was later to be collected in Antarctica. On 11 December <em>Deutschland </em>left for the Weddell Sea, where they discovered Prinzregent-Luitpold-Land {Luitpold Coast} on 30 January 1912. The establishment of a wintering station on a solid iceberg was disrupted by a sudden spring tide surge. Instead Filchner was the first to survey the decay of a gigantic ice field leaving behind Herzog Ernst Bay. Due to rapidly developing sea ice it was decided to sail north, but the ship was trapped by ice at 73°34'S, 33°12'W on 15 March and drifted north in the Weddell Gyre. A station for various scientific observations was installed on solid sea ice. Personal relations on board had already worsened with two groups contending against each other, when the ship's captain died due to syphilis on 8 August. On 26 November the ship got free at 63°37'S, 36°34'W and immediately returned to South Georgia, arriving on 19 December 1883.</p><p>With Larsen's help the expedition was dissolved officially when the acting captain (former first officer) Wilhelm Lorenzen, supported by many of the scientists, refused to obey Filchner. <em>Deutschland </em>was handed over to Filchner's friend, the watchkeeping officer Alfred Kling, who sailed to investigate the South Orkney Islands from 29 January to 7 April 1912. In the meantime Filchner's sledge dogs, which had been housed in a wire pen, had gone completely wild and his ponies were running loose at Hestesletten, south of Grytviken. The mutiny was hushed up, but plans for a further expedition to Antarctica were discarded. Instead Filchner returned home, subsequently serving as an officer during World War I.</p><p>From 1926-1928 Filchner made another expedition to Central Asia to connect magnetic networks in Europe to Asia. In order to consolidate these observations, other expeditions to Central Asia followed in the years 1934-38 and 1939. Due to severe health problems, he returned to India where he was interned by the British in 1940. After World War II he stayed on in Poonah {Pune}, but finally returned to Europe in 1949 to settle in Zurich, where he spent his last years and died on 7 May 1957.</p><p>Filchner possessed the energy to plan and carry through various adventurous expeditions making important contributions to mapping and especially to earth-magnetic measurements in Central Asia. But his need for admiration prejudiced his early expeditions, when he was accompanied by other strong personalities like Tafel. Being a military officer, Filchner was used to hierarchy, but not to teamwork in a group of scientific equals. He intended to be leader of the Antarctic expedition, but had to accept decisions from a civilian ship's captain. His poor handling of the situation on board led to the mutiny of ship's officers and most of the scientists. Filchner learnt from this reverse and never included any scientists in his subsequent expeditions, which were very successful.</p><p>In 1911 he received a PhD honoris causa from the university at Königsberg {Kakiningrad}. On his sixtieth birthday in 1937 Filchner was awarded the German National Prize for Art and Science. In 1938 he became Doctor of Engineering honoris causa of the Technical University Munich and also professor at the University of Berlin. His name was given to the Filchner Rocks off the east end of South Georgia, and in Antarctica to the Filchner Mountains in Queen Maud Land, Cape Filchner divding the Wilhelm II Coast from Queen Mary Coast and the Filchner Ice Shelf at the head of the Weddell Sea east of Berkner Island, where the German Antarctic 'Filchner Station' operated from 1982 to 1999.</p>",

        "body": "<p>Argentine civil pilot, was born on 8 September 1926 in Buenos Aires. His father, Vouchier Crawford FitzGerald and mother Elizabeth Lawler of Dublin had emigrated from Ireland to Argentina, where they married. Miguel L FitzGerald studied at the Otto Krause industrial school of Buenos Aires and graduated in 1945 as a mechanic/technician. In 1946 he was granted a private pilot's licence, in 1948 he qualified as a commercial pilot, and in 1958 as an airline pilot. He worked for Aerolíneas Argentinas and private employers on cargo and passenger flights. In 1984 he was appointed air instructor and retired in October 1988. His most important achievement was the non-stop flight New York-Buenos Aires on 6-8 April 1962 - reportedly, the first journey of this kind in history - though he is better known for his two flights to the Falklands Islands.</p><p>FitzGerald's first flight to the Falklands occurred in the context of Argentine diplomatic manoeuvring before the UN Committee on Decolonisation to claim sovereignty over the Islands. On 8 September 1964 he flew his single-engined Cessna 185 from Río Gallegos to Stanley in three hours and fifteen minutes. He landed on the racecourse, hoisted the Argentine ensign, and left a note with an Islander claiming Argentine sovereignty. He returned to Río Gallegos in four hours. Upon arrival in Buenos Aires, FitzGerald was received as a hero by members of the Tacuara nationalist group, and President Arturo Illia suspended the penalties imposed on him by the Air Force for breaches of air traffic regulations. A formal complaint was filed by the UK at the United Nations, but the Argentine government argued that it was not involved in organising the flight. One consequence of FitzGerald's action was the establishment of a permanent detachment of Royal Marines in the Islands.</p><p>In November 1968 Miguel FitzGerald flew again to the Falklands. Since November 1964 he had been flying the twin-engined Grand Commander and the Cessna 206 owned by the company Editorial Sarmiento, publishers of the tabloid  <em>Crónica </em>and the sensational magazine <em>Así </em>. In preparation for the arrival in the Islands of the British Minister Lord <a href=\"/biographies/chalfont_alun\">CHALFONT</a>,  <em>Crónica </em>'s editor Héctor Ricardo García and FitzGerald decided to try a further landing. This time García wanted to attract publicity during Lord Chalfont's visit. They arrived at the Falklands but, when FitzGerald tried to land on the gravel road leading to Eliza Cove, his aircraft was damaged by the ditches on either side. Falkland Islands Government Air Service (FIGAS) engineers removed the wings from the plane, which was sent back to Argentina on board the transport ship  <em>Darwin </em>via Montevideo.</p><p>It is almost certain that Miguel FitzGerald did not cooperate with any Argentine government agency or political group in his two flights to the Falklands. There is no evidence of connections with the military or nationalist activists, and he was troubled to find that his exploits were politically manipulated. FitzGerald's Irish ancestry has been frequently cited as his chief motive for protesting against British rule in the Islands. However, both in contemporary press reports and recent interviews FitzGerald argued that he had never been anti-British: 'All my ancestors are Irish but I don't hate the English ... I am pro-Argentine, not anti-British' (interview 11 April 2005). National identity is the one flexible characteristic of most Irish settlers in Argentina; upon their arrival they evolved from Irish to  <em>ingleses </em>, and ultimately to committed Argentines. Miguel FitzGerald's emphasis on the  <em>Argentine-ness </em>of his actions may be seen as the typical response of Argentine-born children to the  <em>English-ness </em>of their immigrant Irish parents, as well as a consequence of their determination to prove to society at large that they were loyal Argentines.</p><p>A less frequently mentioned reason was that FitzGerald wished to establish a new flying record. By 1964, among the pilots in the aerodrome at Monte Grande, greater Buenos Aires, there was speculation about the possibility of accomplishing such a flight. Pilots Comi and César Alvarez had tried it in 1954 and failed owing to poor visibility in the Islands. At least with his first flight, this sense of adventure seems to have been a powerful motivation for Miguel FitzGerald, together with his wish to celebrate his birthday in the Falklands.</p><p>Miguel L FitzGerald married Palmira F Rodríguez and they had four children: Gustavo Miguel (1957), Diego Miguel (1960), Carlos Miguel (1965), and Christian Miguel (1970).</p>",

        "body": "<p>naval hydrographer, was born on 5 July 1805 at Ampton Hall, near Euston in Suffolk, the second son of Lord Charles FitzRoy (the second son of the third Duke of Grafton) and Anne, daughter of the first Marquis of Londonderry. His father, after service as an army officer became a country squire, represented a Suffolk constituency in Parliament in a not very distinguished way, and was described as a 'farming, gardening and fox-hunting country gentleman'. The family was well connected politically, and the family tree abounded with army and naval officers, some of great gallantry and distinction.</p><p>Before he was thirteen years of age the young FitzRoy was enrolled at the Royal Naval College at Portsmouth; the normal course lasted from two and a half to three years, but he completed it in one year and eight months. The teaching (physics, astronomy, navigation, naval history, geography, naval architecture, French) was intense and he passed out with full marks and a gold medal. He saw service as volunteer, midshipman, lieutenant and flag lieutenant on the  <em>Owen Glendower, Hind, Thetis </em>and  <em>Ganges </em>in his 'teens and early twenties. These ships had tasks as varied as discouraging smuggling around the Cornish coast and ferrying ambassadors to their posts. His service in British waters, South America and the Mediterranean trained him well; the ships were involved in the occasional skirmish, but in no spectacular action. An officer who served with FitzRoy described him as 'one of the best practical seamen in the service' and one 'with a fondness for every type of observation useful in navigating a ship'.</p><p>Early in 1828, the  <em>Adventure </em>(captained by Philip Parker King) and the  <em>Beagle </em>(under the command of Pringle Stokes) were undertaking a hydrographic survey of the confusion of islands, inlets and promontories that constitute Tierra del Fuego. Faced with severe weather and serious privations, the strain on Stokes became unbearable, and he committed suicide. Although another officer could have had a better claim on the position, Admiral Sir Robert Otway, in charge of the South American Station, gave Robert FitzRoy command of a ten gun surveying brig, the  <em>Beagle </em>, at the young age of twenty three: his confidence was not misplaced. Many months of further survey followed, FitzRoy completing the tasks assigned to him with flair. However, at one stage a whaleboat was taken by a group of Fuegian natives; FitzRoy took several Fuegians hostage, hoping to exchange them for the boat. The tactic was unsuccessful. None the less, FitzRoy resolved to take the group to London, to have them educated (and 'christianised') and returned.</p><p>Just after Christmas 1831 therefore, HMS  <em>Beagle </em>set off again for the South Atlantic, intent on continuing the survey of the southern tip of South America, and returning the now-educated Fuegians to their homeland in the company of a missionary. The west coast of South America was then to be surveyed, and 'a chain of meridians' around the world was to be established: an accurate method of establishing longitude had only recently been developed, and the precise position of many points was still uncertain. Charles <a href=\"/biographies/darwin_charles\">DARWIN</a> was chosen by FitzRoy to act as a companion, and to assist with natural history observations on this second  <em>Beagle </em>voyage. Although the young naturalist (Darwin was 23 on going aboard the  <em>Beagle </em>, four years junior to FitzRoy) did not undergo any Eureka-like experience during the voyage, the observations he made (particularly on the many remote islands he visited) were later to prove extremely important in the subsequent development of his ideas. There is every reason to believe that the discussions, and sometimes vigorous arguments, which Darwin and FitzRoy had while sharing cramped quarters aboard ship, were a significant influence on the young naturalist. On the whole they interacted well, despite occasionally strained relations, sometimes visiting geological and other sites together, and FitzRoy allowing the ship's boats to be used to set Darwin down at a location from which he wished to collect specimens or make observations. The history of science would have been very different were it not for the manner in which these two were thrown together for nearly five years.</p><p>FitzRoy spent several months surveying around Tierra del Fuego in late 1832 and early 1833, during which the Fuegians were returned, but the attempt to establish a mission station was unsuccessful - the missionary was attacked, and his property taken, so that FitzRoy had to remove him, taking him eventually to New Zealand. The  <em>Beagle </em>then sailed for Port Louis, Berkeley Sound, East Falkland. No doubt this was partly to repair the ship after serious storms experienced off the southern tip of South America, and to replenish stocks of beef and water, but FitzRoy also completed detailed hydrographic charts of the Falklands. Superb manuscript charts of parts of the Islands countersigned by Captain FitzRoy are held in the Hydrographic Office in Taunton.</p><p>The captain of one of His Majesty's ships-of-war frequently had diplomatic, administrative or other official duties to perform in the ports visited, and at a number of locations Robert FitzRoy had to sort out petty squabbles or act in some other official capacity. The visits of the  <em>Beagle </em>to Berkeley Sound were typical. On the first visit from 1 March - 6 April 1833, just after Captain <a href=\"/biographies/onslow_john\">ONSLOW</a> had reasserted British control, FitzRoy found a group of French seamen living in tents made from sails; the French whaling ship  <em>La Magellan </em>had been 'totally wrecked'. FitzRoy wrote: 'after due enquiry, I promised to carry as many as I could to Monte Video, and to interest myself in procuring passage for the rest'. He went on 'there was no constituted authority on the islands', the Argentinians having recently apparently abandoned them. The settlement had been 'ruined' in 1831 by the USS <em>Lexington </em>; the few gauchos living there used to 'gamble, quarrel and fight with long knives', the crews of French, British and American whalers, armed with clubs and rifles provided 'no lack of elements of discord'. And it was with 'a heavy heart and gloomy forebodings that I looked forward to the months ... without the presence of a man-o-war, or the semblance of any regular authority'.</p><p>His forebodings were well grounded; in the year that elapsed between the two  <em>Beagle  </em>visits, there were enacted, as Darwin put it, 'complicated scenes of cold-blooded murder, robbery, plunder, suffering and infamous conduct'; several murders were committed; several of the desperados responsible were taken on board the  <em>Beagle, </em>some of them in irons. Dealing with these problems amongst others, and completing the hydrographic survey, and collecting information on the islands took up most of Captain FitzRoy's time during his second visit from 9 March to 7 April 1834.</p><p>The voyage of the  <em>Beagle </em>continued until late 1836, and on his return FitzRoy married Mary O'Brien, by whom he had several children. He spent the next three years completing the charts and reports for the Admiralty, writing his <em>Narrative of the Surveying Voyages of the Beagle </em>, and giving evidence to a House of Lords Committee. On 30 June 1837, Fitzroy wrote to Admiral Beaufort, hydrographer to the navy, giving meteorological and other reasons for establishing the principal settlement in the Islands adjacent to Port William, adding: 'without easy and frequent intercourse with ships the Falklands are not worth notice. With that, they may become invaluable.' He had a brief period in Parliament, followed by a couple of years (1843-1845) as governor of New Zealand. In part because of his autocratic manner his tenure of this position was not a success. Back in Britain he was posted to HMS  <em>Arrogant </em>, the first screw-driven ship of the Royal Navy. In 1850, partly on the grounds of ill health, he resigned from the full-time service of the navy. Always interested in meteorology (he invented a type of barometer), he was appointed the first head of the newly established Meteorological Office. He was promoted to rear-admiral, and developed a system of synoptic charts, weather forecasts and storm warnings. He was a great success in some of these activities, but he had his own priorities, which were not always those of his political masters. He tended to make enemies; sometimes (as with weather forecasts today) his forecasts were wrong, and he was bitterly criticised: he took this hard. Always a traditionalist in many matters, and an evangelical, estrangement with Darwin followed the publication of <em>On the Origin of Species </em>in 1859 and the 'Great Debate' at the British Association meeting in Oxford in 1860. Periods of ill health and depression became longer and more intense and eventually destroyed him: on 30 April 1865 he took his own life, cutting his throat with a razor. There is a bitter irony in this: it was the suicide of Pringle Stokes which had given him the command of the  <em>Beagle </em>; one of his naval forbears had also committed suicide.</p><p>In some ways a caricature of a naval officer of his day, Robert FitzRoy had defects in his character but was a brilliant man; it is for his hydrographic charts and his contribution to meteorology that he is remembered. The precise extent of his influence on Darwin can never be known, but it was considerable. In the Falklands he remains important for his charts, and for his efforts to bring order at a troubled time. In the Islands his name is commemorated in the settlement of Fitzroy and in Fitzroy Road in Stanley; there are various other Fitzroys in South America and Australia, as well as a meteorological sea-area in the Atlantic.</p><p><a href=\"/biographies/button_jemmy\">See Image 69</a></p>",

        "body": " <p>civil servant, was born at  Fitzroy, East Falkland on 5 May 1899, son of Gaston Nicholas Fleuret and his wife  Mary, née Pitaluga. His grandfather, Augustus Nicholas Fleuret, was a gaucho from Paris who had married a widow, Margaret Ellen Warren, in Stanley. Following education at the government school in Stanley, he began his career in government service aged 13 as a messenger in the secretariat in December 1912, being promoted to junior clerk in January 1914, and second clerk in the treasury and customs in October 1919. Fleuret returned to the secretariat the following year when he acted as chief clerk and clerk of councils.</p><p>In November 1922 he accompanied SS <em>Falkland  </em>as customs officer to Punta Arenas. Fleuret was then appointed second clerk back in the secretariat in 1924 then chief clerk in 1928. On 15August 1931 Fleuret was appointed special constable in order to enforce the legal arrest of the SS <em>Fleurus </em>during her voyage from Stanley to West Falkland and return to Stanley. In 1937 he was appointed assistant colonial secretary and clerk of councils then, in January 1941, he became officer in charge at the secretariat. In addition to these posts, Fleuret held a number of further jobs: private secretary to the governor and aide-de-camp to two governors, <a href=\"/biographies/henniker_heaton\">HENNIKER HEATON</a> and <a href=\"/biographies/cardinall_sir\">CARDINALL</a>. He also acted as postmaster (March 1939) and magistrate in May of that year and the previous one.</p><p>On 12 November 1924 Fleuret married Gladys Lillian Etheridge at Christ Church  Cathedral. They had one son: Eric Isadore Fleuret (b1931).</p><p>Fleuret was a keen member of the FIDF and a great deal of its progress and efficiency were due to his efforts. He started at the bottom and was promoted to second lieutenant in January 1931, lieutenant in March 1934, and acted as officer commanding and adjutant in May the following year. In September 1936 he was appointed adjutant and captain in May 1937, achieving his highest rank, major, in August 1942. He was rewarded for his work in the force when in 1940 he was appointed MBE (Military Division). Fleuret also received the Efficiency Decoration of the FIDF in March 1947. As one of the best rifle shots in the Islands, he captained the Falkland Islands Shooting Team at Bisley on three occasions, winning the Kolopore Trophy on two of those and the Junior McKinnon on the third.</p><p>Fleuret was appointed magistrate in South Georgia in April 1942, returning for leave in 1945, when it was reported that there 'hasn't been a single court case there since 1942, the year Major A I Fleuret MBE arrived to become Magistrate and virtual Governor of the territory.' The article, from <em>The Standard </em>(of August 28, 1945), went on to state that he was now in Buenos Aires with his wife and 14 year old son waiting for a ship to take them to Britain so the boy could go to school in England. In addition to magistrate, he held a quiver of South Georgia posts: coroner, deputy collector, deputy postmaster, shipping master and receiver of wrecks.</p><p>In April 1951 Fleuret, who had suffered from severe asthma up to the age of 17, was medically examined in London. He was not considered fit for further service in South Georgia or the Falkland Islands and was retired on medical grounds on 13 July 1952. He died on 9 February 1987 at Guildford.</p>",

        "body": "<p>Roman Catholic priest, was born on 5 December 1823 at Whitefield, Tramore, Co Waterford, eighth of the eleven children (nine boys and two girls) of Michael Foran and Bridget, née Dooley. His father appears to have been a nephew of Dr Nicholas Foran, Catholic bishop of Waterford and Lismore. His early education was at a Latin School close to home; then at St John College, Waterford. Subsequently he studied theology at Maynooth College, where he was ordained in 1857. He immediately went to England and joined an elder brother, Fr Robert Foran, in the diocese of Hexham and Newcastle working with Irish immigrants in the impoverished city parish of St Andrew's, Pilgrim Street. In 1860 he moved to a new mission at Walker near Newcastle. He dearly loved the people of Walker and during the next fifteen years he would build a large church, a presbytery and several schools.</p><p>Somehow Foran became aware of the precarious spiritual condition of Catholics in the Falklands. He appealed to his bishop Dr Chadwick to be allowed to work there; his bishop agreed and Cardinal Manning was involved in making all the various arrangements with the relevant Vatican authorities to allow Foran to work in the Islands. He left Walker on 17 September 1875 on the long sea journey which was broken with calls at Lisbon and Río de Janeiro before arriving in Montevideo. He then sailed on the FIC schooner <em>Black Hawk  </em>for Stanley where he arrived on 3 December. He was well received by Governor <a href=\"/biographies/darcy_george\">D'ARCY</a> and lived for a while at Government House before obtaining his own residence. His journal notes are revealing:</p><blockquote><blockquote>I have often wondered how coolly and quietly I took my departure, fully aware of the \"breakers ahead\", which at that distance seemed to have no terror for me. I am full of sadness now that I have arrived at my destination...The desires of past years are now accomplished. How often have I wished that I should be favoured with a sight of this country.</blockquote></blockquote><p>It was a tough and arduous climate in which to work but with his accustomed energy he soon organised his preaching ministry, started catechism classes as well as Sunday School in Stanley and also travelled in the Camp by horse and around the islands by schooner to visit the distant faithful. There was work to be done and soon he opened a school under the care of Samuel Walker, a teacher from his former parish of Walker. Life was hard and it was not without reason that Governor TF <a href=\"/biographies/callaghan_jeremiah\">CALLAGHAN</a> would describe the islands as 'one of the most backward of Her Majesty's colonies'. One of the few gripes Foran ever expressed was over the irregularity of the mail and he often comments in his letters about waiting for the post.</p><p>Solitude and the harsh climatic conditions took their toll and so from 1881 Foran would divide his time between his mission to the Islanders and the rural Irish community in Argentina. During the next five years he would reside at San Nicolás de los Arroyos (Province of Buenos Aires) and travel back and forth between the Islands and Argentina via Buenos Aires and Montevideo. During the months of January and February of 1886 the church which was built for and by Catholics and opened in 1873 on Pump Green was moved to a site acquired by the Catholic community on the 'Front Road'. Foran took his final leave of the Falklands on 20 April 1886, staying at San Nicolás for some six months before sailing for Naples on 18 October. From there he went to Rome to advise the missionary organisation, Propaganda Fide, about his labours and on the way back to Newcastle gave a lecture about the Irish community in Argentina to students of the Irish College, Paris.</p><p>In a letter of 15 April 1886 to Mrs Caroline D'Arcy, widow of the former governor, and written just five days before leaving Stanley, Foran revealed his true feelings: 'As I am now preparing to leave the Falklands I think it is only right that I should tell you so. I have remained in this place longer than I intended. I am sorry however that I go away without having done any lasting good. I have attempted several schemes to put the Mission on a lasting footing - and all failed'. He was always the humble priest.</p><p>By 1887 Foran had returned to the diocese of Hexham and Newcastle and was installed as parish priest of Blackhill, County Durham. He was back, and although not their priest, the people of Walker who loved him so much, presented him with a formal address of welcome home. He died on 29 January 1900. An editorial in the <em>Consett Chronicle </em>of Friday 9 February 1900 observed:</p><blockquote><blockquote>None who knew him but loved him, none but felt their hearts drawn towards him, to the last by his gentleness, his sympathy, his love of Nature, and, above all by his gentleness and unaffected humility ... Energetic and assiduous in the performance of his priestly duties, Father Foran was admired and loved. In the pulpit, or the platform, the homely language, the gentle, earnest, impressive manner of this kind old man fixed the attention and won the hearts of all. His life was devoted solely to the poor. No home was too mean or miserable for his visits - no sick parishioner too ragged or wretched to be sought out and comforted by him. He looked upon men as children of God, on all Christians as the redeemed of one Saviour.</blockquote></blockquote><p>There are two known photos of Foran both held in the Archive of St Mary's Church in Stanley. One, with a group of six ladies in Victorian dress and three sisters of the Congregation of the Sisters of Charity of St Paul the Apostle, was taken sometime between 1887 and 1899 at St Mary's Primary School, Blackhill. The other is a head and shoulders portrait.</p>",

        "body": "<p>Johann Reinhold Forster was born on 22 October 1729 at Dirschau, Polish Prussia {Tczew, Poland}, the only child of the marriage of Georg Reinhold Forster and the widow Eva Platt in 1727. In 1745-48 Johann Reinhold attended the Joachimsthal-Gymnasium, and from 1748 to 1751 the Friedrichs University, Berlin, where he studied mostly theology. On 26 February 1754 Forster married his cousin Justina Elisabeth née Nicolai (b 15 August 1726), daughter of Carl Benjamin and Susanna Nicolai. Their son George, christened Johann George Adam, was the oldest of seven surviving children (one child died at birth). George, known as Georg in German literature, was born on 26 November 1754 at the rectory in Nassenhuben, where Johann Reinhold was a pastor for almost 12 years. Johann Reinhold found pastoral work at the Nassenhuben rectory stifling and, after a journey to Russia (March 1765 to August 1766) by invitation, he moved to England, taking George with him. Johann Reinhold tutored in modern languages and natural history at the Warrington Academy in Lancashire from 1767 to 1769. His wife and other six children joined him in September 1767.</p><p>Johann Reinhold Forster was 42 when he joined the  <em>Resolution  </em>as principal naturalist on Captain James <a href=\"/biographies/cook_james\">COOK</a>'s second voyage to the Pacific, 1772-75. His 17 year old son George Forster and the botanist Anders Sparrman (1748-1820) accompanied him as scientific assistants, with a servant. The expedition's second ship the  <em>Adventure </em>, <em> </em>captained by Tobias Furneaux, was separated from the  <em>Resolution </em>in late 1773 and returned to England independently in July 1774, a year before the return of the  <em>Resolution.  </em></p><p>Father and son were accomplished writers and natural philosophers with many skills. Neither enjoyed an untroubled life. Johann Reinhold, a member of the Royal Academy of Madrid and the Society for Promoting Natural Knowledge, Berlin, and Fellow of the Royal Society (elected 27 February 1772), quarrelled with the Admiralty over the publication of his account of the  <em>Resolution </em>'s voyage. Forster published this under his son's name with the title <em>A voyage round the world in His Britannic Majesty's sloop Resolution </em>. In it, George noted that his father was on the  <em>Resolution  </em>'to extend his observations to every remarkable object'.</p><p>The  <em>Resolution </em>rounded Cape Horn on 29 December 1774. The ship sighted what is now known as South Georgia on 14 January 1775. Details of the first recorded landings on the 'Isle of Georgia' are scant, but both father and son were probably in the boat party which accompanied Cook on the first landings there, at Possession Bay on 17 January 1775. As the Forsters' published account states, and as is generally accepted, the name given to the island by Cook was suggested by Johann Reinhold as 'Southern Georgia':</p><blockquote><blockquote>As it had been the main object of our voyage to explore the high southern latitudes, my father suggested to Captain Cook, that it would be proper to name this land after the monarch who had set on foot our expedition, solely for the improvement of science, and whose name ought therefore to be celebrated in both hemispheres,</blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>- Tua sectus orbis</blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>Nomina ducet! Hor.</blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote> <em>[Horace: 'A part of this world will bear your name.']  </em></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>It was accordingly honoured with the name of Southern Georgia, which will give it importance, and continue to spread a degree of lustre over it, which it cannot derive from its barrenness and its dreary appearance.</blockquote></blockquote><p>The  <em>Resolution </em>sailed southeast from South Georgia to Clerke ('Clerke's') Rocks (22 January 1775) and stood off from them in heavy fog.</p><p>On 31 January 1775 the  <em>Resolution, </em>approaching from the south, sighted the previously unknown island arc now known as the South Sandwich Islands at 59°30'S, 27°30'W. As with South Georgia, both Cook and Johann Reinhold Forster record giving the name of Southern Thule to the first land sighted - a mountainous, rocky, snowy island with steep inaccessible coasts. Cape Montagu and Saunders Island ('Saunder's Isle'), 57°48'S, 26°35'W were sighted next day, 1 February, and two smaller islands (the Candlemas Islands) the following day.</p><blockquote><blockquote>The whole country had the most desolate and horrid appearance which can possibly be conceived; not a single grass could be discerned upon it, and it seemed to be forsaken even by the amphibious and lumpish animals which dwelt on Southern Georgia.</blockquote></blockquote><p>Cook named the islands Sandwich Land after the first lord of the Admiralty. The remoteness and barrenness of the land, and the ship's shortness of provisions, led him to abandon Antarctic investigations in March and sail east and then northward in the  <em>Resolution </em>.</p><p>George Forster, also a fellow of the Royal Society (elected 9 January 1777), <em> </em>published his own record of the voyage as  <em>Observations made during a voyage round the world.  </em>In the absence of any commercial interest in South Georgia, he concluded:</p><blockquote><blockquote>It should therefore seem probable, that though Southern Georgia may hereafter become important to mankind, that period is at present so far remote, and perhaps will not happen, till Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego are inhabited, and civilized like Scotland and Sweden.</blockquote></blockquote><p>George Forster married Therese Heyne (1764-1829), daughter of Christian Gottlieb Heyne, in 1785. The couple had two surviving daughters Therese (1786-1862) and Klara (1789-1823), and a daughter Louisa and son George who died as infants. The marriage eventually failed to prosper, and Therese later remarried. After appointments to the chair of natural history at the University of Vilna {Vilnius} and as librarian at the University of Mainz, he espoused the revolutionary cause when Mainz was occupied by the French in October 1792 and was elected to the National Assembly in Paris. He died there on 10 January 1794 at the age of 39, probably of pneumonia, and was buried in an unmarked grave in Père Lachaise cemetery.</p><p>George predeceased his father by almost five years. Johann Reinhold Forster was appointed a professor of natural history, mineralogy and medicine at the University of Halle, Germany, in November 1779. He was awarded a Doctor of Civil Laws (Oxford University). He died of heart disease in Halle at the age of 69 on 9 December 1798, and was buried in the municipal graveyard. His wife Justina was buried in the same plot on 10 December 1804, and their daughter Justine in 1826. Johann Reinhold left a valuable library and herbarium; his wife was the sole beneficiary of his will.</p><p>Vilification of Forster by William Wales seems to have been largely responsible for the picture which has prevailed of Johann Reinhold as a disagreeable man of perhaps scientifically dubious worth. Though he was far from adept at smooth social intercourse or at self-promotion, Johann Reinhold Forster (like his son) was a remarkable and erudite scholar and natural historian, and - in the words of his biographer Michael Hoare - 'the first government-paid scientist in the British service'. He made the earliest scientific observations of the South Georgia and South Sandwich region, collected and named species of penguin and petrel including the king penguin, and drew or oversaw the drawing of more than 500 plants and 300 animals. He wrote fundamental works on albatrosses and petrels. His books, catalogues and published letters show the extent of his contribution to zoological, botanical, geographical, historical and philological knowledge in eighteenth century Europe.</p><p>Johann Reinhold is commemorated by the name of Forster Passage between Bristol Island and the three islands of the Southern Thule group - Southern Thule, Cook and Bellingshausen Islands - in the South Sandwich Islands, and in the name of the plant genus  <em>Forstera  </em>of South America, Australia and New Zealand, a herb in the trigger-plant family named by Linnaeus in 1780. He is also commemorated in place names in New Zealand (Lake Forster at Dusky Sound, and Mount Forster), and in dozens of names of plants, birds and other animals.</p>",

From school he joined the Royal Fleet Auxiliary, serving as a radio officer. He was amongst those rescued from an RFA vessel which was mined in the invasion of Sicily. Subsequently he served as an intelligence officer in the USA. He married Joyce Ethel Greene in 1945 and had one son and two daughters.</p><p>Following demobilisation in 1945 he took a degree in economics and comparative religion at the London School of Economics, joining the Colonial Service as an administrative officer in Tanganyika {Tanzania} in 1948. He worked there till 1962, becoming a district commissioner and leaving as principal assistant secretary for external affairs.</p><p>Towards the end of his time in Tanganyika French was a central figure in a notable confrontation between the forces of African nationalism and the colonial government in the run-up to Tanganyikan independence at the end of 1961. He was district commissioner of Geita in Sukumaland in 1957 and 1958 when the government's attempt to install a multiracial district council (as opposed to an all-African council) resulted in numerous illegal protest meetings and finally a mass march on Mwanza, the provincial capital, at the end of July 1958, which was dispersed by force with the use of tear gas. The policy was abandoned not long after following a change of governor. The interest of the incident lies in what it reveals about French's character in the light of his subsequent performance in the Falklands nearly twenty years later. Highly regarded as an administrator by his superiors, he found himself embattled and isolated in his single-mindedness and impatience in carrying out a policy which was not of his making against the increasing strength of African nationalist feeling.</p><p>Leaving Tanganyika after independence he joined the Commonwealth Relations Office (subsequently subsumed into the FCO). He was soon the subject of further controversy. Working in the British representative office in Salisbury {Harare} following Rhodesia's unilateral declaration of independence, he was accused by the illegal Smith regime of 'taking part in espionage directed at undermining Rhodesian economic and security matters' and required to leave the country at short notice. It appears that French was doing no more than perfectly properly researching and passing on information to the British government about Rhodesians travelling the world on sanctions breaking business. However, he had to return to London. He subsequently became head of chancery in Río de Janeiro (1972-75) and chargé d'affaires in Havana (1972-74) before being appointed to the governorship of the Falklands at the beginning of 1975. This was to prove an unhappy experience.</p><p>French came to the Falklands at a time of difficulty and tension in the relationship with Argentina which would have tested the mettle of any governor. In April the new British ambassador in Buenos Aires was obliged to warn the Argentines that an attack on the Islands would be met with a military response. The announcement in October 1975 of the terms of reference for Lord SHACKLETON's 1976 Report provoked an immediate hostile Argentine reaction. The Shackleton team which arrived on 3 January 1976 had not been permitted to travel via Argentina. On 4 February 1976 the RRS <em>Shackleton </em>78 miles from the Falklands was fired upon by an Argentine destroyer which attempted to arrest her. Captain Philip <a href=\"/biographies/warne_philip\">WARNE</a> contacted French who responded robustly and decisively, telling him to ignore the destroyer and proceed to Stanley.</p><p>On 11 February Mr Ted <a href=\"/biographies/rowlands_edward\">ROWLANDS</a>, minister of state in the FCO met the new Argentine foreign minister in New York, obtaining assurances that the <em>Shackleton </em>could proceed with her research unhindered and agreeing in principle that the dialogue on the Falklands should in due course be resumed, (Franks Report p 12). In March 1976 the Cabinet approved Prime Minister CALLAGHAN's proposals for 'a fresh dialogue on all aspects of the dispute, both the possibility of Anglo-Argentine economic co-operation in the South-West Atlantic' and 'the notion of a hypothetical constitutional relationship.' (Franks p 13). In general HMG's tone appears to have been conciliatory, certainly too conciliatory for Islanders, although it was accompanied by warnings about the use of force and secret discussions in Whitehall about how the Islands might be recovered if captured. Britain had already agreed to an Argentine request for the withdrawal of the British ambassador on 20 February to de-escalate the situation and the various arrangements for collaboration with Argentina - the air service, the provision of fuel supplies and gas for cooking - continued while Shackleton's team did their work.</p><p>All these comings and goings seem to have aroused the deepest suspicions in the Islands. French found himself loyally defending the British position which was essentially one of cooperation with Argentina whilst parrying, though not rejecting out of hand, Argentine attempts to couple this with consideration of the sovereignty issue. In his first address to the LegCo in June 1975 he had felt able to say no more than that 'we live in an era of rapid change' and to commend 'imaginative and statesmanlike acceptance of the need for change,'(LegCo Minutes 17 June 1975). By the time he addressed LeCo a year later on 16 June 1976 he was regretting the 'stress and anxieties' caused by Argentine actions but making a point of 'recalling some of the more encouraging features of our relations with the Argentine people' and the need to achieve 'an evolving, harmonious and profitable relationship with our great neighbour' on the basis of 'the efficient and imaginative conduct of British diplomacy' and trust in 'the integrity of the British Government' in producing policies in the 'interests' both of Islanders and of its wider concerns in Latin America.</p><p>Whilst French's formal statements were carefully coded and were in accordance with British Government policy, it appears that his general behaviour made Islanders more and more uneasy and distrustful in an already tense atmosphere. He was, it was said, obsessed by security, and a <em>Times </em>article (26 August 1976) recorded that Government House was 'bolted and barred to an unusual degree'. He admitted that at one stage he was requiring the local news bulletin to be submitted to him before it was broadcast on the grounds that ' you could have all sorts of ... fabrications and extreme points of view being pushed out with apparent government blessing'. Yet the same <em>Times  </em>correspondent expressed the view that he was 'undoubtedly sincere and has the interests of the Islanders at heart but does not seem able to convince them of this'.</p><p>He appears to have brought to his governorship of the Falklands many of the characteristics which had served him so ill in Tanganyika in 1958, nearly twenty years before: a single mindedness in carrying out what he correctly conceived to be his duty to his masters coupled with a strong authoritarian streak and lack of judgment. His obsessions about security and secrecy set up a barrier between him and the Islanders. He was openly criticised by the Falkland Islands Committee in London. His previous experience in Latin America (which the FCO doubtless thought appropriate and relevant) probably added to local suspicions. Delays in the FCO in implementing the recommendations by a local Select Committee to amend the Constitution to make it more democratic did not help. On 14 October a very popular local pilot, Ian <a href=\"/biographies/campbell_ian\">CAMPBELL</a>, died in the crash of a FIGAS Beaver aircraft. There followed a strong disagreement between Governor French and Executive Councillors over the circumstances of the crash and the setting up of an enquiry into it and a subsequent angry public meeting of some 200 people on 20 October. On 16 November Governor French announced that he was leaving the Islands on 2 December for consultations in the FCO about the Shackleton Report and would not be returning. Governor <a href=\"/biographies/parker_james\">PARKER</a> almost immediately replaced him. French had not been responsible for any single catastrophic decision and there is no evidence that he had any agenda apart from the implementation of British policy. His style, however, had increased Islanders' suspicions and apprehensions about that policy when what they needed was reassurance. French was governor of the Falkland Islands from 27 January 1975 until 2 December, 1976, the shortest tenure of any governor of recent times.</p><p>He subsequently served as deputy high commissioner in Madras until his retirement in 1980. He was awarded the LVO in 1968 and the CMG in 1976. He died on 21 April 1995 just short of his seventy-fifth birthday.</p>",

        "body": " <p>French naval officer, the second son of Louis de Saulces de Freycinet (1751-1827), had his first taste of exploration while serving in Nicolas Baudin's expedition to Australia (1800-1804). On the expedition's return to France, Freycinet was responsible for preparing the resulting charts for publication and completing the official account of the voyage. In 1817 he proposed a scientific voyage around the world, to amplify the knowledge of its physical geography. His proposal was accepted and he was given the command of the 350 ton corvette  <em>Uranie.  </em>His 22 year old wife Rose, however, was determined not to be separated from her husband on what was likely to be a long voyage and, with his connivance, was smuggled on board the  <em>Uranie </em>the evening before she sailed.</p><p>Departing from Toulon on 17 September 1817, Freycinet's voyage took him to various places in the Indian and Pacific Oceans, before sailing from Port Jackson in New South Wales on Christmas Day 1819, bound for France. On suffering damage off the south coast of South America, Freycinet decided to call at the former French settlement of Port Louis in Berkeley Sound for repairs. However, while entering the sound on 14 February 1820, the  <em>Uranie </em>struck an underwater rock, now known as Uranie Rock, off Volunteer Point, the northern entrance point of the sound. The  <em>Uranie </em>got off unaided. The damage, however, was extensive and the pumps were unable to stem the inflow of water. In consequence the corvette was run aground on a sandy beach on the southern side of the sound, in what is now known as Uranie Bay, about six miles short of the former French settlement. An encampment was set up on shore, to house the ship's company and as much of the provisions and the expedition's equipment and records as could be salvaged. To feed some 100 men, hunting parties were sent out to search for the wild cattle and horses left behind by the earlier settlers and to shoot geese and seals. As there seemed little prospect of being found by passing shipping, Freycinet decided that the  <em>Uranie </em>'s longboat would have to be made ready to sail to Montevideo to seek help. At the same time the observatory was set up near the encampment, which enabled various observations to be made for magnetic declination and presumably variation and, on 15 March, of an eclipse of the Sun. During their stay <a href=\"/biographies/duperrey_louis\">DUPERREY</a>, the expedition's hydrographic surveyor, completed a survey of the sound, including a large-scale plan of what is now known as Duperrey Harbour. The expedition's botanist, C Gaudichaud-Beaupré, made a study of the vegetation around Port Louis and in 1825 published the  <em>Flore des Iles Malouines </em>, in which he described 64 native species he had collected. On 19 March a cutter, attached to the sealer  <em>General Knox </em>of Salem, Massachusetts, anchored off West Point, entered the sound. Freycinet persuaded her master to return to the  <em>General Knox </em>, with Midshipman Dubaut, one of the  <em>Uranie </em>'s officers, to negotiate with Captain Orne to take the  <em>Uranie </em>'s crew and equipment to Río de Janeiro.</p><p>However, before Duhaut returned, the 280 ton vessel <em>Mercury </em>, Captain John Galvin, flying the flag of the United Provinces (the Argentine rebels), entered the sound, having suffered a leak on rounding Cape Horn, forcing him to make for the sound for repairs. Freycinet at once agreed to help repair the  <em>Mercury </em>and at the same time entered into negotiations with Galvin to take him and the  <em>Uranie </em>'s crew to Río de Janeiro. When Duhaut returned with Captain Orne <em>, </em>to complete similar negotiations, these were discontinued in view of Galvin's undertaking. On 18 April the British whaler  <em>Sir Andrew Hammond </em>, Captain Henry Hales, entered the sound after a highly successful voyage. As she was about to sail directly for England, Hales agreed to take dispatches to the French Embassy in London, thus bringing to Paris the first news of the disaster. Before sailing in the  <em>Mercury </em>, Freycinet was visited by James <a href=\"/biographies/weddell_james\">WEDDELL</a>, who had earlier written to apologise for not been able to assist. Freycinet was impressed by Weddell and presented him with the  <em>Uranie </em>'s longboat, as he could not take it with him. Weddell promptly renamed it  <em>Rose </em>in honour of Freycinet's wife, who had impressed him with her vivacity and charm.</p><p>The  <em>Mercury </em>set sail on 27 April, but Freycinet's problems were not over. On the way north Galvin objected to making for Río de Janeiro on the grounds that not only might his vessel be seized by the Spanish Consul there, but that he might be imprisoned for carrying weapons for the Chilean patriots in Valparaiso. Freycinet overcame this problem by purchasing the  <em>Mercury </em>from Galvin, renaming her the <em>Physicienne </em>. Now in command of his own vessel once more, Freycinet called at Montevideo to land Galvin and later at Río de Janeiro and Cherbourg, before anchoring in Le Havre on 13 November 1820, three years and fifty-seven days after the expedition left Toulon. In 1832 the Freycinets were living in Paris when there was an outbreak of cholera. Freycinet was struck down, but being devotedly nursed by Rose he recovered. The cholera then attacked Rose and in twenty-four hours she was dead. Freycinet lived for another ten years, dying in Mirmande (Drome) on 18 August 1842, just after his sixty-third birthday.</p>",

He trained as a military engineer and sailed on the <em>St Joseph </em>, 350 tons, for over two years, from January 1712 to August 1714, visiting the South Seas. Besides studying Spanish fortifications in South America, Frézier was well placed to assess current maps of the area and to make corrections. He drew up new charts which took account of the discoveries of recent voyages by frigates from St Malo and published a detailed illustrated account in 1716 on his return to Paris.</p><p>Frézier's map of southern Tierra del Fuego and the Falklands was the best of the area so far made. It showed the east coast of East Falkland in some detail, although it did not distinguish Falkland Sound or attempt to chart the western coasts. Later French explorers and colonists used Frézier's plans and Admiral Lord <a href=\"/biographies/anson_george\">ANSON</a> took an English translation of his book with him. Frézier named the Islands on his map, the 'New Islands' and more fully in the map's title: 'New Islands discovered by the vessels from St Malo, of which the western part is still unknown'. The French king's geographer, Guillaume Delisle, on his map of 1720, published in 1724, compressed this to 'Isles Malouines'. The name stuck and became 'Islas Maluinas' and then 'Malvinas', in Spanish and, briefly, 'the Maloons' in English.</p><p>Frézier's expedition became celebrated for bringing back samples of the Chilean strawberry, <em>fragaria chiloensis </em>, which was crossed with the smaller European variety to produce the present fruit.</p>",

        "body": "<p>geologist, expedition leader and administrator, was born on 11 February 1908 at Freshwater on the Isle of Wight, only child of an English mother, Violet Anne Watson and a German father Ernst Fuchs. He attended Asheton preparatory school in Kent, where he acquired his first nickname, Bunny, and after Brighton College went on to St John's College, Cambridge. Despite a poor degree, he mixed with influential contacts in the Cambridge polar network who shaped his life and went on a geological field excursion to Greenland in 1929. He spent the next nine years in colonial East Africa on various privately funded expeditions conducting scientific enquiries largely on his own terms, coming to grips with all the problems of logistics, man management and the death of companions in a tough climate and in remote and difficult terrain. He spent most of the war in Britain and East Africa, finally leaving the army in October, 1946.</p><p>Back in Cambridge Fuchs applied to the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey (FIDS) as a geologist and was surprised to be appointed field commander, starting in July 1947. Stewart <a href=\"/biographies/slessor_robert\">SLESSOR</a> showed Fuchs the ropes on his inaugural journey around the bases early in 1948. Without specific instructions, he was free, in 1948 and 1949, to make two long sledge journeys down George VI Sound with his geological companion Ray <a href=\"/biographies/adie_raymond\">ADIE</a>. At Stonington base Fuchs received the nickname Papa, an obvious recognition of the generational gap between him and many of his colleagues. He was an enthusiastic dog sledger, and a meticulous observer and recorder of places and events, but he generally left the scientific and survey work to others.</p><p>As field commander, Fuchs had reported to Governor <a href=\"/biographies/clifford_sir\">CLIFFORD</a> in Stanley who was constitutionally responsible for all aspects of the operations, including the scientific programme. Over the next few years, however, power and control moved inexorably to London. With his appointment, in June 1950, as the Principal Scientific Officer of the new Falkland Islands Scientific Bureau, Fuchs was the man who, by and large, implemented, although not always initiated, this shift of responsibility through numerous incremental organisational changes. He was well-placed to understand the many almost insoluble conflicts among the paymasters, the politicians, civil servants, scientists, practical managers and the men in the field, and he earned much of the credit for keeping it all together.</p><p>But administration of this kind was not as important to him as the need to satisfy his ambition to cross Antarctica, an idea he had formulated with Adie in 1949 and discussed with Clifford in 1950 on his way home. Clifford was naturally enthusiastic, and, to the extreme consternation of Fuchs, immediately wanted to organise it within FIDS. In 1953 Clifford was thwarted when Fuchs got the amber light: Sir Raymond Priestley took over the running of FIDS Scientific Bureau to release Fuchs for the Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition (CTAE), and Clifford was brought on side with two more bases being set up on the Antarctic Peninsula in 1955. Fuchs's great CTAE adventure eventually came off between 1955 and 1958, although much of the glamour was captured by plucky Edmund Hillary who drove his Ferguson tractor to the pole rather than wait deferentially at a depot for his leader to arrive. Both men were knighted for their remarkable achievement. Sir Vivian returned to FIDS on 1 January 1959 as its first director, and continued to draw power away from Stanley, which he visited again, after an interval of ten years, in the southern summer of 1959-60. He was by this time in his early fifties, and in his autobiography he revealingly and wistfully described the next thirteen years as being 'Towards Retirement and After'.</p><p>As director until 1973 when he retired at the age of 65, he enjoyed periodic cruises around the Antarctic bases (passing through Stanley early in the years 1964, 1967, 1970, 1971 and 1973), intervening in day-to-day decisions and telling the young explorers what it was like in the old days. From London he swapped notes with Governor <a href=\"/biographies/arrowsmith_sir\">ARROWSMITH</a> on the performance of each new Jaguar that he bought and he battled against administrative changes, notably the incorporation of the British Antarctic Survey (as FIDS had become on 1 February, 1962) into the bureaucracy of the Natural Environmental Research Council. Thereafter Fuchs remained active on committees of the great and the good.</p><p>In 1935 he had married his cousin Joyce Connell, an adventurous spirit who had accompanied him on several expeditions. They had three children: Hilary (b1936) Rosalind (1938-1945) and Peter (b1940). Joyce Fuchs died on 27 April 1990. On 8 August 1991 he married the widowed Mrs Eleanor Honneywill, née Biscoe, who had become his personal secretary on the CTAE in 1955. Fuchs suffered a heart attack in 1987 and a severe stroke in December 1997. He died in Cambridge, aged 91, on 11 November 1999, leaving an estate valued for probate at £533,101. Fuchs was commemorated on postage stamps issued by the British Antarctic Territory in 2000.</p><p><a href=\"/biographies/adie_raymond\">See Image 2</a></p>",

        "body": " <p>naval officer and missionary, was the fifth son of Samuel Gardiner of Coombe Lodge, Oxfordshire, and his wife Mary, née Boddam. He was born on 28 January 1794 in the parsonage house at Basildon, Essex, where his parents were temporarily living. He had a religious education, and in May 1808 entered the Royal Naval College, Portsmouth. On 20 June 1810 he went to sea as a volunteer on board HMS <em>Fortune </em>, and then on HMS <em>Phoebe </em>, on which he served as midshipman until August 1814, when, having distinguished himself in the capture of the American frigate <em>Essex </em>, he was sent to England as acting lieutenant of the prize ship. Being confirmed as lieutenant on 13 December 1814, he afterwards served in the <em>Ganymede </em>, the <em>Leander </em>, and the <em>Dauntless </em>in various parts of the world, and returned, invalided, to Portsmouth on 31 October 1822. On 1 July 1823 he married Julia Susanna Reade; she died on the Isle of Wight on 23 May 1834.</p><p>As second lieutenant of the <em>Jupiter </em>, Gardiner was at Newfoundland in 1824, and in 1825 came back to England in charge of the <em>Clinker </em>. He obtained his promotion as commander on 13 September 1826, after which, although he often applied for employment, he never succeeded in obtaining any other appointment. Long before this, however, he had developed an interest in missions, and he therefore decided to become a missionary. In 1833 he published <em>Outlines of a Plan for Exploring Australia </em>, but in 1834 he went to Africa instead, explored Zululand, and started the first missionary station at Port Natal. From 1834 to 1838 he attempted to establish Christian churches in Zululand, but political events and native wars combined to prevent any permanent success; he described his experiences in his <em>Narrative of a Journey to the Zoolu Country  </em>(1836). On 7 October 1836 he married, as his second wife, Elizabeth Lydia, eldest daughter of Edward Garrard Marsh, vicar of Aylesford, Kent. From 1838 to 1843 he worked among the Indians of Chile, going from island to island in the South American archipelago, but his efforts were foiled by the opposition of the various governments.</p><p>He first visited the Falkland Islands on 23 December 1841, anchoring in Berkeley Sound after sailing from Valparaiso. With the help of Lieutenant Cox of HM Ketch <em>Sparrow </em>the party erected a small wooden house they had brought with them at Port Louis. During Gardiner's stay, <a href=\"/biographies/moody_richard\">MOODY</a> arrived as governor and a few days after Gardiner left on the schooner <em>Montgomery </em>in late March, Captains <a href=\"/biographies/ross_sir\">ROSS</a> and <a href=\"/biographies/crozier_francis\">CROZIER</a> arrived in the <em>Erebus </em>and <em>Terror </em>. Gardiner arrived in Tierra del Fuego on 22 March 1842.</p><p>The Church Missionary Society was now under pressure to send out missionaries to Patagonia but declined on the ground of shortage of money. Similar proposals were unsuccessfully made to the Wesleyan and London Missionary societies. Eventually in 1844 a special society was formed for South America - the Patagonian Missionary Society - and Robert Hunt, a schoolmaster, was sent out as the first missionary, accompanied by Gardiner. This attempt to establish a mission failed, however, and they returned to England in June 1845. Gardiner, not discouraged, left England again on 23 September 1845, and, in company with Federico Gonzales, a Spanish protestant, from whom he learnt Spanish, went to Bolivia, where he distributed bibles to the Indian population despite much opposition from Roman Catholics. Having established Gonzales as a missionary at Potosi, Gardiner came back to England, landing at Southampton on 8 February 1847. That same year he published <em>A Voice from South America </em>.</p><p>Gardiner spent 1848 making a survey of Tierra del Fuego with a view to a mission, and suffered great hardships. He then tried to interest the Moravian Brethren and the Foreign Missions of the Church of England in his enterprise, but neither could help. In the end, a lady from Cheltenham gave £700 and the mission was dispatched. Accompanied by Richard Williams (surgeon), Joseph Erwin (ship's carpenter), John Maidment (catechist), and three Cornish fishermen - Pearce, Badcock, and Bryant - Gardiner sailed from Liverpool on 7 September 1850 in the <em>Ocean Queen </em>, and landed at Picton Island on 5 December. He had with him two launches, each 26 feet long, in which had been stowed provisions to last for six months. The Fuegians were hostile and ready to plunder, the climate was severe, and the country barren. Six months passed without the arrival of further supplies, which were stuck at the Falkland Islands. The missionaries gradually died of starvation, Gardiner, the last survivor, dying, it is believed, on 6 September 1851. Captain <a href=\"/biographies/smyley_william\">SMYLEY</a>, of the <em>John Davison </em>, sent to assist them, arrived on 21 October, and HMS <em>Dido </em>called at the island on 6 January 1852. But all that could be done was to bury the bodies and bring away Gardiner's journal. About three days before his death he wrote a 'Missionary Memoir' where he outlined a plan for 'Conducting the Future Operations of the Mission to Tierra del Fuego'. The principle was:</p><blockquote><blockquote>To convey a few of the natives to the Falklands ... to teach them English and learn their language, and to provide a brigantine or schooner of 100 tons burden as a mission vessel.</blockquote></blockquote><p>Thus the idea of the Mission Station on Keppel Island was born. Two years later, in 1854, the <em>Allen Gardiner </em>(54 tons) was sent out to Patagonia as a missionary ship, and in 1856 Captain Gardiner's only son, Allen W <a href=\"/biographies/gardiner_allen1\">GARDINER</a>, went to Patagonia as a missionary. Gardiner is commemorated in the 1994 Falkland Islands stamp commemorative issue on the 150th anniversary of the South American Missionary Society.</p>",

They arrived in the Falklands on 30 August and kept a journal of that time which gave a 'light hearted and lively view of life on Keppel, not found in his more formal letters'.

He and his wife travelled to Lota, in central Chile where he built a school and church for the English-speaking residents, most of whom were miners, and made contact with the Araucanian Indians. After a number of years in Chile he returned to England in poor health. He died at Natal, South Africa in 1878.</p>",

He was baptised George Frederick Ernest Albert. With his elder brother <a href=\"/biographies/albert_victor\">ALBERT VICTOR</a>, he visited the Falkland Islands on 24 and 25 January 1881 during a world cruise in HMS <em>Bacchante </em>. For the first 26 years of his life he did not expect to succeed to the throne, and it was only the unexpected death of his brother in 1892 which made him heir apparent to his father. He had enjoyed his naval education and served in the Royal Navy until 1892. In 1893 he married Princess Victoria Mary (May) of Teck, later Queen Mary, who had been betrothed to his late brother. They had six children, among them two kings, Edward VIII and George VI. After the accession of his father in 1901, George was invested as Prince of Wales and took on increasing royal duties. He succeeded to the throne in 1910.</p><p>In a reign which began with political turbulence at home and saw the British Empire facing the strenuous challenge of World War I, it cannot be expected that the King would have been much concerned with the Falkland Islands, a remote corner of his vast dominions. But in 1915 he certainly discussed the Battle of the Falkland Islands with Governor <a href=\"/biographies/allardyce_sir\">ALLARDYCE</a>, telling him, on the latter's return to London: 'You had a very narrow shave, much narrower than you may probably have been aware of'.</p><p>The King was an enthusiastic and knowledgeable philatelist, and postmasters in the Falkland Islands and on South Georgia were well aware of his interest in the hobby. In January 1928, when the stock of ½d and 2½d stamps held on South Georgia was exhausted, authority was given to surcharge the 2d with a 2½d (the foreign surface rate) with a locally produced handstamp. The handstamp was made at Leith Harbour and a total of 1179 were surcharged. The Postmaster in Stanley instructed his counterpart in South Georgia to 'preserve about 8 ... and a block of four for HM King George V.' In 1933 the Falkland Islands celebrated the centenary of British administration of the islands and a set of stamps was produced to celebrate the occasion. The designer of the stamps was George <a href=\"/biographies/roberts_george\">ROBERTS</a>, the Colonial Engineer. The King personally approved the designs, but he rejected the image of himself chosen for the £1 value. At his insistence the design that was eventually used depicted him in the full dress uniform of the Royal Highland Regiment of the Black Watch.</p><p>George V died on 20 January 1936 at Sandringham, Norfolk. In a reign of 26 years he had guided Britain and her Empire steadily through the strains which followed relative economic decline, colonial restiveness, world war and the rise of competing states. The visit of the future King Emperor to the Islands in 1881 is now almost forgotten and the large official portraits of George and Mary have been moved from Government House to the Museum in Stanley.</p><p><a href=\"/biographies/albert_victor\">See Image 3</a></p>",

        "body": "<p>New Zealand agriculturalist, was born in Wellington, New Zealand on 10 August 1903, the elder son of Dr Harry Gibbs and Annie, née Gardner. He had a BAgr and a MAgrSc from New Zealand colleges and a PhD from the University of Minnesota, USA. His academic qualifications particularly suited him for service in the Falkland Islands because they were gained at a time when the fertility of New Zealand farming was becoming depleted and scientific research was first being applied to agriculture. Gibbs married Brucie (Bryn) Deroles in 1929. They had two sons: Bruce and Douglas (b1941 in the Falkland Islands).</p><p>Gibbs was appointed Director of Agriculture in Stanley on 28 May 1940 at a salary of £700 per year. He was especially concerned with pasture improvement and with the need to provide fresh vegetables for the military garrison. He also developed a dairy herd in Stanley with sufficient fodder to provide fresh milk for the entire population of Stanley - both civilian and military. Gibbs was appointed a member of ExCo (he served for six years he was the comptroller of civil defence and also government employment officer.</p><p>On the completion of his tenure of office as Director of Agriculture, Gibbs wrote a substantial report on his activities during the six years he had worked in the Islands; the Preface is revealing:</p><blockquote><blockquote>When considering this report I should like the reader to recall that in 1940, when I arrived in the Colony, there was less than two acres of ploughed land within a reasonable distance of Stanley ...</blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>I venture to think that considerable improvement in the prosperity of the Colony is possible if some of the leads which have appeared as the result of this work are followed up and applied. But they represent ideas and practices new to the Colony, and as such must meet with a deprecatory criticism, especially from an industry notorious for its conservative obstinacy.</blockquote></blockquote><p>Much of the Gibbs Report outlines his efforts to respond to the government appeal made in 1942 to supply the newly arrived garrison with vegetables. The government appealed to all gardeners to grow more vegetables, potatoes and rhubarb, and it agreed to buy whatever was grown. Quantities of artificial fertiliser were purchased from Montevideo to assist with this programme.</p><p>Large areas of coastal land were fenced and planted with native tussac grass, with mixed results. Gibbs's Report details his oversight of the government dairy herd of sixty cows. Both Gibbs and Howell <a href=\"/biographies/evans_howell\">EVANS</a> made monthly educational broadcasts on agricultural and horticultural subjects on the radio from 1945 onwards. Both men commended the planting of trees as shelterbelts for animals.</p><p>Gibbs' comments on the quality of the sheep in the Islands revealed that not much had changed since Hugh <a href=\"/biographies/munro_hugh\">MUNRO</a> wrote his report, although the cattle and sheep of the Islands seemed healthy enough. He wrote extensively on the importance of combining pasture sub-division with rotational grazing:</p><blockquote><blockquote>Greater benefit would accrue if sheep were grazed in larger mobs and rotated from paddock to paddock as the grazing was exhausted. Cattle should follow to eat the rank grasses left by the sheep ... Controlled over-grazing of this nature can only bring improvement to native pastures, chiefly through consolidation, removal of surplus growth, and the concentration of animal manure.</blockquote></blockquote><p>The research work of William <a href=\"/biographies/davies_william\">DAVIES</a> on grassland improvement was re-examined and applied to the Falklands Islands situation. The farming practices of Port Howard, Holmested Blake, and the Falkland Islands Company were commended. Gibbs reported that birds of prey continued to be destroyed; payment for the beaks of the Striated Caracara had been discontinued in 1931. Reduction of the Upland Goose continued, and Gibbs agreed that they were particularly troublesome and destructive on newly sown pastures. Gibbs made a number of observations about the rural economy of the Islands; they revealed his understanding of the difficulties of effecting change on the Falkland Islands.</p><p>The full version of his Report was never published, but Governor <a href=\"/biographies/clifford_sir\">CLIFFORD</a> printed a much-abridged version in 1947. Gibbs was an enthusiastic supporter of Governor <a href=\"/biographies/cardinall_sir\">CARDINALL</a>; the respect was mutual; on 5 February 1948 Cardinall wrote from England to Gibbs:</p><blockquote><blockquote>Your work as Director of Agriculture in the Falkland Islands was remarkably good and I could not have found a better man. Actually its value will be appreciated more and more as the years go on. There was so much to do and of so varied a kind; and you worked it out so well and so carefully. I should have liked you to continue with me had I remained.</blockquote></blockquote><p>The Gibbs family left the Islands on 26 July 1946 on board the <em>Fitzroy </em>. On his return to New Zealand in 1947 Gordon Gibbs moved through Victoria University College (now Victoria University) to become associate professor in 1968. For ten years he was in charge of all Botany Department student field work. He contributed to various professional publications and was the second recipient of the New Zealand Association of Scientists' Service to Science Medal.</p><p>Gibbs retired in 1969. His recreational interests included music, trout fishing, gardening and horse racing. He died on 14 Oct 1978 at Wellington aged 75. His wife was tragically killed in November 1979 in the Air New Zealand crash on Mt Erebus, Antarctica.</p>",

As a  <em>teniente de navío </em>, Gil was sent to the naval station in the River Plate, in command of the frigate  <em>Santa Rosa </em>, and was part of the squadron under  <em>Capitán de navío </em>Juan Ignacio <a href=\"/biographies/madariaga_juan\">MADARIAGA</a> which entered Port Egmont in June 1770 and forced the surrender of the British garrison under George <a href=\"/biographies/farmer_george\">FARMER</a>. During his time in command of the  <em>Santa Rosa </em>Gil was employed with smaller vessels on surveying and reconnaissance duties in Magellan Strait and the Falkland Islands, and thus was familiar with the islands.</p><p>He was still in command of the  <em>Santa Rosa </em>when he took over from Domingo <a href=\"/biographies/chauri_domingo\">CHAURI</a> as  <em>comandante gobernador </em>at the Spanish settlement of Puerto de la Soledad (Port Louis) on 5 January 1774. Probably later that year the frigate  <em>Santa Perpetua </em>was sent to Puerto de la Soledad with sufficient provisions and stores for eight months and 30 soldiers commanded by infantry captain Pedro Amores to relieve the garrison. But as it proved impossible to load all the stores on the frigate she was accompanied by the brig <em>Santo Cristo del Buen Fin </em>, commanded by Juan <a href=\"/biographies/pascual_callejas\">PASCUAL</a> Callejas. As well as his usual duties as governor, Gil was asked to ensure that the British had indeed complied with their undertaking to abandon Port Egmont, which the Spaniards sometimes referred to as Puerto de la Cruzada. In consequence, in 1776, Gil sent Pascual in the  <em>Santo Cristo del Buen Fin </em>, to confirm that the British had evacuated Port Egmont as promised and to make a plan of the port. Pascual reported that he found indications that the settlement had been visited recently, he presumed by the British. He also destroyed the buildings of the settlement and took down from the door of the blockhouse the lead plaque which Samuel <a href=\"/biographies/clayton_samuel\">CLAYTON</a> had placed there and took it back to Puerto de la Soledad A little later Gil sent  <em>Piloto  </em>Juan de la Peña to Port Egmont in the brig  <em>Santa Paula,  </em>which had arrived at Puerto de la Soledad in January 1778, to make a further examination and to survey the port. Peña anchored below Monte de la Vigía {Look-out Hill}, the 810 foot high hill on Keppel Island , near the entrance to Port Egmont, from where he could see a brig at anchor off the former British settlement, which was not flying an ensign. Peña remained here for five days watching the brig's launches taking away and loading objects that had been abandoned there. Peña returned to Puerto de la Soledad to obtain provisions and to report to Gil, who sent him back to Port Egmont, where Peña continued to observe the brig for seven days, when the brig departed. He then entered Port Egmont and after a careful examination was able to report some timber, but no signs of any people. On 10 May Gil reported to Viceroy Juan José de Vertiz his opinion that the British had indeed abandoned Port Egmont. In 1777 Pascual was again sent to Port Egmont and this time he reported that the British had been seen in the area catching and processing seals, suggesting that Spanish territorial jurisdiction was being violated. Gil requested to be relieved of his duty as governor on the grounds of ill health and was replaced on 19 February 1777 by Ramón de <a href=\"/biographies/carassa_y\">CARASSA</a>.</p><p>On 6 April 1788, by now a  <em>jefe de escuadra </em>, Gil was appointed Viceroy of New Granada, comprising present day Ecuador, Colombia, Panamá and Venezuela, and President of the Royal High Courts of Quito, Santa Fe de Bogotá, Panamá and Caracas. His final promotion was to  <em>capitán general de la real armada. </em></p>",

        "body": "<p>Swedish photographer, was born on 28 February 1921, at Njutånger, Hälsingland, Sweden, the son of Per Erik Eriksson, farmer and postman, and Svea Eriksson. He went to high school and to evening school in journalism. He married twice: first to Astrid Bergman in 1950 and second to Harriet Forssell in 1962 and he had two children: Pia (b1950) and Björn (b1966). His career as a freelance photographer took off when he was given a bonus by a Swedish newspaper for his coverage of the 1956 Olympic Games in Melbourne. He used this money to spend months in the Indonesian jungles covering exotic animals and peoples. The book he published following this stay allowed him to continue travelling, and soon he had visited bear country in Alaska, savannahs in Africa, mountains in the Middle East, and the Galapagos Islands. He became a prolific producer of television documentaries, at a time when there was only one channel in Sweden. Many of these programmes, as well as his books, were translated into, among other languages, English, German and Russian.</p><p>His curious mind tempted Gillsäter to visit places where few Swedes had set foot, and where there was an interesting flora and fauna. In addition to all the various kinds of penguins that live on the Falkland Islands, he was intrigued by the stories of Norwegians who had settled there after the whaling days. He told himself that there must be good reasons beyond escapism to settle in these extremely remote, isolated and wind-blown islands. In the southern summer of 1968-1969, Gillsäter together with his wife Harriet and two and a half year old son Björn, set off to spend six months in the Falkland Islands. He was contracted by the Swedish Television to do three documentaries about human and animal life on the Islands, which were eventually aired in 1969. This assignment was in many ways the most ambitious project he undertook, both in length of stay and because the whole family was involved. A base was established in Port Stanley. Burning peat for heating, having penguin eggs for breakfast, and eating mutton for lunch and dinner soon became second nature for the little family. News travels fast in a small community such as the Falklands, and with help from the 'squeaky box' (broadcasting by telephone system) most people soon knew about the exotic visitors.</p><p>Small seaplanes took the family all around the Islands, where they were received by the local farmers, plus the thousands of penguins, albatross, sea lions and elephant seals. This was in many ways paradise for Gillsäter. Whenever required, the family spent days in a small blue tent, allowing them to become part of the various animal communities and to document their lives, day and night. The hospitable yet sometime 'quirky' Islanders opened up their homes and spent hours discussing life on the Islands with the visitors. People in Stanley were also welcoming: Governor Haskard invited the family to the New Year's celebrations; a couple invited them to their wedding; and they took part in the annual horse races.</p><p>Gillsäter later visited the Falklands again in 1978 for a week and South Georgia briefly in 1980. He died in Sweden on 12 October 2001. He had published some 25 books, including <em>Pingviner i Vind(Penguins in the Wind),</em>an account of the family's stay in 1968-69. He made numerous television documentaries, including three on the Islands.</p><p>Some of his images of Islands life were reproduced (thanks to support from the Shackleton Scholarship Fund) for a photo exhibition at Falkland House in London in 2005, which subsequently travelled to Stanley.</p><p>Photographs by Gillsäter.</p> <p><a href=\"/biographies/davis_john1\">See Image 113</a><br><a href=\"?q=node/236\">See Image 178</a></p>",

        "body": "<p>farmer, was born in Auchmithie, Angus, Scotland on 5 December, elder son of Peter Edward Gilruth, farmer, and his wife Mary Steele Gilruth, née Meikle. On leaving Arbroath High School he worked on the family farm until 1930, when an introduction to Fred Langdon, then manager of Fitzroy Farm, led to an offer of employment with the Falkland Islands Company as a farm cadet.</p><p>He sailed from Liverpool on 19 September aboard the <em>Orita </em>arriving in Stanley on 14 October 1930. Two days later he sailed into Fitzroy on the <em>Falkland.  </em>Working with the men at Fitzroy, he soon learned the skills that made him a good 'Camp' man. His philosophy was to do what he was told and do it better than anyone else. In 1936 he was appointed assistant to Camp manager George Goddard at Darwin. During this time 'roads' between Fitzroy, Darwin and North Arm were made. The Company acquired Fox Bay West and Spring Point farms and in 1939 Gilruth moved to West Falkland. His task was to integrate the two farms. The War had just started, labour and materials were in short supply (men had left to join the Forces­ - Gilruth himself was refused leave to do so). Nevertheless he instigated major improvements, a new cookhouse and store were built, the shearing shed enlarged, the water supply improved, and telephone installed. The telephone poles had to be dragged from Fox Bay jetty to Spring Point and Mt Sulivan by horse. In 1945 Goddard retired and Gilruth was sent to Darwin. He took over as Camp manager after Langdon retired in 1947. The entire breeding policy of all the Company farms was Gilruth's responsibility. In 1946 he flew to Australia and New Zealand where he bought 100 Romney rams to improve the breeding stock. In 1950 he made further purchases in Argentina, Chile and Uruguay. The wool yield increased under his management from 8lbs/head in 1945 to 9¼ lbs/head in 1964. At Darwin, as at Fox Bay, Gilruth improved work and living conditions. New houses were built and others renovated throughout the farms, running water and electricity provided to all houses at Darwin and Goose Green. A new cookhouse and storage sheds were erected and Diesel engines installed for the shear shafts and wool press at Goose Green. He selected the Fish Creek site for Darwin Boarding School, which provided a quantum leap in the education available to children in the Camp at that time. Attempting to improve the grass, he had a 'sod seeder' made to sow 'Yorkshire Fog' seed directly into the existing white grass; results were mixed. He planted trees at Goose Green and at Burnside - some thrived. In the early 1950s he helped to distribute trout fry into the rivers and streams that now provide such excellent fishing - alas the dangers to the native Falklands trout were not then foreseen.</p><p>Gilruth was a member of the LegCo for 12 years and sat on ExCo occasionally. He was a JP and acted on occasion as coroner. At Darwin he conducted funerals. He was appointed a Director of the Company in 1957 (serving until 1972) and awarded an OBE in the 1964 New Year's Honours List, for services to the public.</p><p>He left the Islands in March 1964 retiring to Arbroath, Scotland where he was a regional councillor for a number of years. Gilruth was a big gentle man with a great sense of fun, humour and fair play but intolerant of incompetence and humbug. A keen fisherman and an excellent shot, he continued to enjoy both sports well into his eighties. He maintained a lifelong interest in the Falklands.</p><p>He married twice, first, Ella Bell who died in Stanley on 1 January 1951 and second Helen Chisholm who died in Arbroath 21 October 1989. There were two sons and a daughter by the first marriage; Peter (b1938) Janet (b1940) and John (b1943), and two daughters Jean (b1953) and Sheila (b1957) by the second.

He went to the Government School in Stanley and although school-leaving age was 14, stayed on an extra year. He remembered life in Stanley as carefree without frills, a place where one made one's own amusements. After school he worked on the government daily newssheet <em>Penguin  </em>for £3 a month, before being transferred to the Electricity and Telegraphs Department as a clerk.</p><p>He had joined the Defence Force at the age of 18, and the outbreak of war saw him posted to Sapper Hill battery as a signalman. He was later recalled to the civil service, but worked with the patrol ships <em>Roydur </em>and <em>Afterglow </em>at nights as a signalman. He spent seven years acquiring accountancy qualifications from correspondence colleges and when an auditor, Robert <a href=\"/biographies/boumphrey_robert\">BOUMPHREY</a>, arrived from England in 1947, Gleadell became his clerk. After three years, he was sent to the Colonial Audit Office in London and then to Gibraltar for six months. In 1950 he returned to the Islands to become auditor, and after seven years in this post he was promoted in 1959 to become colonial treasurer, the first Islander to fill this post. While the budget was small in post conflict terms, the Treasury also ran the Savings Bank and the old age pensions scheme as well as transferring money abroad and supervising telephones, broadcasting, the air service, the power station, a trading vessel and even the funeral service.</p><p>Gleadell had married Mildred Lees in 1950: they had one son, Graham (b1950). In 1961 he married Vera Beal and had two children: Lois (b1962) and Stephen (b1964). He was a keen marksman from his schooldays and was full bore champion in 1960, competing at Bisley on five occasions.</p><p>In 1966, Governor <a href=\"/biographies/haskard_cosmo\">HASKARD</a> was recalled to London for consultations and Colonial Secretary <a href=\"/biographies/thompson_willoughby\">THOMPSON</a> was on leave, so Gleadell was sworn in as acting governor. He soon faced a challenging situation when an Argentine DC4 airliner was hijacked by the <a href=\"/biographies/condor_group\">CONDOR</a> Group and force landed on Stanley racecourse. The Islands' Defence Force surrounded the plane and eventually the hijackers surrendered. Gleadell's handling of a delicate situation during a politically sensitive period was widely praised and he attained his objective of resolving the incident without casualties on either side.</p><p>The Queen awarded him the OBE, while in Tierra del Fuego an order for his arrest was issued on charges of 'deprivation of freedom, public intimidation, rebellion and theft.' Travel through Montevideo henceforward attracted the attention of the Argentine press and there were calls for 'extradition'. This, plus concern that it might be necessary for his children to be educated in Argentina, were among the reasons why Gleadell retired from government service in 1972 and emigrated to New Zealand. He worked there for ten years as accountant for a department store. On his retirement he relaxed with his grandchildren, played golf and ran a large vegetable garden.</p><p><a href=\"/biographies/arrowsmith_sir\">See Image 12</a><br><a href=\"?q=node/125\">See Image 98</a></p>",

Julius junior was educated to LLB and PhD and acted as legal adviser to the Swiss Legation in Washington. He married Dr Dorothy Burne. During the years 1915 and 1916 Columbia University awarded him a scholarship which enabled him to visit the Spanish archives at Simancas, and Madrid. As associate in law at Columbia University he wrote <em>The Struggle for the Falkland Islands </em>which was published by Yale University Press in 1927 and reprinted in 1982 with an introduction by Prof JCJ Metford of Bristol University.</p><p>Metford's introduction describes Goebel's work as: 'the only substantial work in English' [to back the Argentine claim] and as 'an impressive examination of the material available at that date'. Metford points out that the book was written: 'when isolationism in the USA was at its most vociferous, and nowhere more so than in the Law School of Yale University' but he concedes that 'it must be acknowledged that he [Goebel] approached the question of the sovereignty of the Falkland Islands with commendable scholarly integrity'.</p><p>The Foreign Office in London studied the book in 1927 at the suggestion of their chargé d'affaires in Buenos Aires, Victor Mallett, who urged that a rebuttal be published. One official minuted: 'I do not find in it any great perversion of fact. It is rather in the patently and consistently hostile deductions from these facts that we have cause to quarrel with the author'. The general view was that it was best to let matters lie. C Duff minuted:</p><blockquote><blockquote>This old controversy is quite dead - the Argentine press never refers to it nowadays and, as far as I know, there has been only one public reference to it worth noting in Argentina during the last few years and that by a \"stunt\" politician. It would be a mistake to revive the question by getting reviews published here or in BA of Goebel's book which appears to have been ignored in both countries.</blockquote></blockquote><p>This was the final decision although the despatch so informing Buenos Aires enclosed a Foreign Office library paper on the background to the dispute which (perhaps not surprisingly in the heyday of empire) made no reference to the Islanders or any right of self-determination they might enjoy.</p><p>The Spanish edition, <em>La Pugna por las Islas Malvinas, </em>was published by the Argentine navy (to whom Goebel had generously ceded his rights) in Buenos Aires in 1950.</p><p>Although Goebel's scholarship impressed the Foreign Office in 1927, there is no sign that he visited the archives in London or Buenos Aires and his grasp of the 1820s and 1830s is far from sure. But his book has certainly been influential in providing academic backing for the resurrection of the Argentine claim.</p>",

        "body": "<p>governor, was born in London on 20 June 1839, the second son of Thomas Goldsworthy, an attorney with connections in Calcutta, and his wife (and cousin), Sophia, née Tuckfield. He was educated at small private schools in London and in 1854 entered Sandhurst. After a successful year, he fell sick and decided to join the army in India where his family then were. After the Indian Mutiny broke out, Goldsworthy joined Havelock's Volunteer Cavalry, a scratch unit of a score or so, and saw action at the relief of Cawnpore {Kanpur} and the defence of Lucknow. Goldsworthy was gazetted into the XVII Lancers and returned to England with them in 1865, but service in a cavalry regiment required a private income which he lacked. So in 1867 he took a post in Sierra Leone as Inspector of Police.</p><p>In 1869 he married a widow with two children, Lisa Egan, in Woolwich. He was then recruited by the governor of Lagos to become commandant of the Hausa Police. He was sent on several military/diplomatic missions to the interior and moved to the neighbouring colony of Gold Coast {Ghana} as deputy commissioner at Accra. During the Sixth Ashanti War, he was engaged in several battles and was wounded in the hand, returning to England to convalesce. In 1876 he was offered the presidency of the Caribbean colony of Nevis and in 1877 appointed colonial secretary in Western Australia, where he promoted the exploration of the north of the colony. A further Caribbean posting followed in St Lucia and in 1884 he was sent as governor designate to British Honduras. 'I think him one of the most energetic and efficient of our minor administrators' wrote the permanent secretary at the Colonial Office. He spent four years in Belize and was in dispute with the leading commercial company in the colony.</p><p>In 1891 he was posted as governor to the Falkland Islands and he and his wife arrived in Stanley in January 1891. His time in the Falklands was dominated by the land issue - the contest between the two dozen major landowners who were reluctant to part with any of their acres and those, led by Goldsworthy, who hoped to see land made available to colonists who sought opportunities to better themselves. His predecessor Governor <a href=\"/biographies/kerr_thomas\">KERR</a> had sold land on generous terms to the leaseholders and when Goldsworthy attempted to impose a proper survey on the farms (whose extent was grossly underestimated in their leases) in the hope of releasing two million or so surplus acres, he met with stubborn resistance from the landowners, who collectively resigned their positions as Justices of the Peace. This was a challenge he could not overcome and he effectively backed down, leaving emigration to Patagonia as the only option for ambitious colonists.</p><p>The colony's sheep flock reached its greatest size in Goldsworthy's time, increasing from half a million to 807,000 head. Scab* remained a problem and three stock inspectors were introduced from New Zealand to control the infection.</p><p>The Falkland Islands Volunteer Force was founded by Goldsworthy following the arrival in Stanley harbour in June 1891 of a Chilean vessel, the <em>Maipu </em>, laden with armed insurgents who were engaged in a civil war. As the colony was defenceless, he summoned help from the navy and recruited and armed his volunteers, ensuring that henceforward there would always be a local defence force in the Islands.</p><p>Goldsworthy's wife returned to England soon after his arrival and those in the Islands who were opposed to his policies hinted that he was too familiar with too many people. Certainly he is remembered for the after-dinner games of 'Coo-ee', which were played in Government House - apparently a variety of 'postman's knock'.</p><p>He retired in 1897 and joined his wife in a flat off Kensington High Street, where he died on 5 May 1900. He was a governor with remarkably wide imperial experience and one who made a spirited attempt to broaden the ownership of land in the Islands - but failed.</p>",

        "body": "<p>housewife, was the eldest daughter of William Henry Goss and Ann Goss, née Aitken ('Billie' <a href=\"/biographies/goss_william\">GOSS</a> was a younger brother). William Henry was a Camp cook when he married and Christina was born at San Carlos. Her moment of fame came in 1914 when the German Asiatic Fleet of Admiral Graf von <a href=\"/biographies/spee_maximilian\">SPEE</a> targeted the Islands after their victory at Coronel. Although, in the prelude to the Battle of the Falkland Islands, the German squadron of warships was first sighted by a Falkland Islands Volunteer Force outpost, the German colliers were seen approaching the Islands by two teenage girls out riding in the Camp. Christina Goss and Mearon McLeod rode back to the Camp farm where they were working and reported what they had seen to Mrs Felton (later Mrs Creamer) who telephoned the news to Stanley. The story of the two young girls riding to their mistress with news of what they had seen was a favourite dinner time story of Admiral <a href=\"/biographies/sturdee_sir\">STURDEE</a>, the commander of the victorious British squadron in the subsequent battle. For their resourceful and prompt action Mrs Felton was awarded the Order of the British Empire, and the girls were each given an inscribed silver teapot.</p><p>After her hour of fame, Christina settled down to be a farmer's wife. She married, on 25 October 1916, at St Mary's Catholic Church, Stanley, Christopher Peter William Bender (b1895). Bender's father (Christoph Peter Wilhelm <a href=\"/biographies/bender_christoph\">BENDER)</a> was another of those Islanders who arrived in dubious circumstances, at first hiding in a cave near Stanley. More genteelly, mother was a lady's companion who had to leave her charge, having fallen ill, and convalesce at Stanley. In 1875 Bender entered into partnership with William <a href=\"/biographies/coulson_william\">COULSON</a> who had leased the 4,000 acres of Moody Valley Farm from the Government the previous day. The partnership ended in litigation in 1890 and Bender then farmed by himself. Interestingly the Admiralty Wireless station was erected, after the Battle, on Moody Valley land. The lease of the farm was transferred to Christina's husband in 1926, and there she lived.</p><p>Meanwhile three sons were born to the family: James Paul Kenneth (b1917), Sidney Christopher (Jim) (b1918) and William Jacob (1920-1985). The farm seems to have been a constant source of dispute between both generations of Benders and the Government. The former felt they were being overcharged for poor land, and the latter that the Benders were poor farmers (in one governor's words). Whatever the rights of the matter the farm was never a financial success and eventually in 1949 Christopher Bender, Christina, and family were evicted. The marriage must have been under strain following this and it ended in 1953 with Christina and the two eldest boys emigrating to Australia, while Christopher and the youngest boy left for England. She died on 23 August 1979.</p><p>As a postscript, the two elder sons, James Paul and Jim, returned to the Islands in 1992 with the teapot presented to their mother. It is still in the ownership of the family in the Falkland Islands.</p>",

        "body": " <p>colonist, was born in Shoreditch, London on 17 August 1825, the son of Richard Victor Goss and Sophia Sarah, née Mann. The young man of 17 who arrived at Port Louis in the brig <em>Alarm </em>on 10 April 1842 just three months after Governor <a href=\"/biographies/moody_richard\">MOODY</a> was probably part of an indenture package arranged by G T <a href=\"/biographies/whitington_george\">WHITINGTON</a> in London to provide farm labour for his brother J B <a href=\"/biographies/whitington_john\">WHITINGTON</a> out in the Falklands. In return for their passage the Culey family, which seems to have included Goss, had to work for the Whitingtons for several years at low wages. The deals offered were so bad that the Governor asked that future settlers be warned against them. Goss may still have been working at Port Louis as late as December 1844, though most settlers had moved to Stanley the previous year.</p><p>Although his various trades can be presented in a simple sequence the reality is likely to be much more complex with some or most of these strands being carried on simultaneously, and the effort accorded to each varying with circumstances and the opportunity for profit. Once in Stanley Goss started working to make his fortune and within a few years achieved security for his wife and growing family. He married the Plymouth born Ann Elizabeth Pedrick, who was three years his junior. They had nine children: Louisa Ann (b1850), Sophia Jane (b1852), Richard William Napoleon <a href=\"/biographies/goss_richard\">GOSS</a> (b1853), Ann Elizabeth (b1854), Margaret Fanny (b1856), Abner Charles (b1858 - died in infancy), Georgina Helen (b1859), Emily Jane (b1861), William Henry (b1862) and Abner Cosmopolite (b1865). By the time his first child was born, in October 1850, he had bought a whaleboat, and started sealing: he had led work gangs building the roads of the new town, and probably some of the houses too; and he was being paid 6d a day for each prisoner in his care as jailer for the colony. Some of these skills he may have brought to the Islands since he could already have been an apprentice stonemason. It seems significant that the first child was born at 'Pedrick Cottage', his wife's maiden name, and he may well have built it. Four years later he was able to embark on his major building venture.</p><p>The plot of land that was Crown Grant No 67 of the 25 March 1854 was bordered by the harbour, the Deanery, Victory Green and Flagstaff Hill in parts. On it Goss built five cottages and, sandwiched between them, a hotel, the Eagle. This arrangement may have given rise to the story that the hotel was built so that it could be divided into nine cottages, one for each of his children. There was a bar selling wine, spirits and draught beer, and a room with bunking for the growing number of seamen who were marooned for a time in Stanley either by wreck or repair. The most famous resident was the great actress Ellaline <a href=\"/biographies/terriss_mary\">TERRISS</a> born there on 13 April 1871 but no doubt the sailors were more profitable. From the hotel would branch out naturally some of the other strands of his business, auctioneering no doubt related to the ships on which his lodgers served, and their effects. With supplies of food and drink to obtain for the hotel it was but a step to supplying similar products to visiting shipping, and from this to progress to general merchandise, as well as the ownership of a schooner the <em>Louisa </em>.</p><p>For a successful married man with a family of nine Jacob Napoleon's end seems premature and unnecessarily suspicious. He had made his will in May 1867 and died of 'serious apoplexy' (a stroke) on the 11 September 1868. The fact that his father had died just three days earlier (of 'debility' which given his age, 77, was unsurprising) may have given rise to the legend of their murder by the Colonial Chaplain, the Reverend Charles <a href=\"/biographies/bull_charles\">BULL</a> (since the legend has Reverend Bull fleeing the islands, and he did not leave until 1872 this provides more confusion concerning Jacob Napoleon's death). Other sources say that JM <a href=\"/biographies/dean_john1\">DEAN</a> bought the Eagle Inn when Goss died in July 1875 (bought subsequently by the Falkland Islands Company, it became the Ship Hotel and later still the Upland Goose Hotel) but this is clearly an error. It is true that in that year Goss's widow obtained the grant of a government cottage on the basis that she was destitute; which seems strange given that Jacob Napoleon's will stipulated the business should be carried on for the benefit of the family, and included the hotel, the schooner and a house on John Street. (His wife died in Stanley on 11 September 1904). Whatever the mystery of his fate Jacob Napoleon Goss deserves to be known as one of the founders of modern day Stanley.</p>",

Born less than a decade after the move to the new settlement of Stanley, Richard Goss's early years were also the early years of the town; when he was four months old his father obtained the grant of the land on which the Eagle Inn was built. No doubt his early years revolved round that establishment where the skills that he later put to use as a publican would have been imbibed. His immediate future, however, lay in the Camp working initially as a gaucho, and then, as the wild cattle were eliminated, learning the skills of a shepherd. Opportunities for romance were limited in such an environment so marriage to Sarah Ann Belcher, the daughter of a shepherd on the same farm may have been inevitable. There was a twelve year difference in age: she was 16 when they married on 20 February 1881 at Holy Trinity Church, Stanley (the consecrated Assembly Rooms), and they then returned to Port Howard. They had at least four children: William Henry Goss , Richard William Napoleon (born before 1888), Ernest Edmund and Eva Malvina . In 1883, a move was made to Stanley; although even five years later his occupation was given as 'gaucho/ shepherd'. Two years after that, now 37 years old, he returned to the trade he had observed as a child and is registered as a publican.</p><p>Why, over 50 years after his father arrived from Britain, Goss decided to return there is unknown. In view of his later difficulties it may be that a 'fresh start' was called for but in 1894, with his second son for company, he left the Islands. The rest of the family joined the two pioneers that same year at the public house Richard had found in Belfast. Six years later his wife and family felt another break was needed, not just from the British Isles but from his profession. Perhaps the profits were being consumed in kind by Goss himself but it is definitely stated that by 1900 he had a drink problem. So the family returned to the Falkland Islands, and Goss returned to the craft of a shepherd. He survived for nine more years but a fall from his horse led to his death by exposure at the early age of 56. Richard William Napoleon Goss was probably typical of many men of his time for whom the obvious escape from the hard work and loneliness of early settlement life was exacerbated by his career on the other side of the bar. His wife died in 1936 in Reading.</p>",

His first job, after leaving school at the age of 13, was to earn his keep and clothing on the farm of his elder sister, Christina <a href=\"/biographies/goss_christina\">GOSS</a> and her husband Chris Bender at Moody Valley. But by 16 the primary strand of his working life, as a seaman, began, carrying cargo with Jeff Bundes round the islands as a hand in the schooner  <em>Shamrock </em>. Supplying tussac grass and penguin eggs to Stanley involved living in the 'Bug Hutch' on Kidney Island for long periods before his first stint as mate, on the drifter  <em>Gentoo </em>.</p><p>On 18 July 1936 he married Grace Elizabeth Miller, the start of a 65 year partnership. They had six children: Greta (b1937), Randolph (1939-2000), Eric (b1941), Jill (b1943), Tyrone (b1945), and Simon (b1956). There was probably a break with the sea at the time of his marriage in 1936. He then undertook a variety of jobs for the Falkland Islands Company in Stanley whilst building 62 Davis Street. Then it was back to the  <em>Gentoo </em>, this time as skipper, for another three years. Sixteen years of navigational experience was a sound basis for a period of rising status that culminated in his master's ticket. From third mate to master he was associated with some of the best loved ships in the recent history of the Islands - SS  <em>Fitzroy </em>, SS <em>Lafonia </em>, and the RMS  <em>Darwin </em>. On the  <em>Fitzroy </em>he was a member of the wartime Operation Tabarin* in Antarctic waters, and his close involvement with the  <em>Darwin </em>enabled him to add navigation into the Pool of London to his many experiences; (his only significant absence from the Islands was in 1957 to help supervise the building of this ship).</p><p>His second major break with the sea was the decade from 1963-73. As farm manager, for much of that time at Port Stephens, he was closely identified with initiatives to improve Islands agriculture. The growing of potatoes and pasture improvement can be added to a role in the eradication of keds* from the sheep population. So, although by 1974 he was back at sea as master of the  <em>Monsunen </em>, with Sidney <a href=\"/biographies/miller_sydney\">MILLER</a> and Richard HILLS he was a founding member of the Livestock Ordinance Committee formed to devise the rules that ensured this disease did not return. His final ship was the MV  <em>Forrest </em>from which he retired at the age of 78 in 1989.</p><p>Goss's other interests and offices would be sufficient to occupy the whole of any ordinary person's life. These include secretary of the Sheep Owners Association, chairman of Dean Brothers, long public service not just on both Government councils but also as Justice of the Peace, but these did not preclude him from actively following his hobbies of photography, boxing, and rearing poultry. 'Bill' Goss MBE would have deserved a place in this volume for his maritime experience of the Islands, or for his pioneering work to improve its agriculture, or for his record of public service. He had one other claim to fame though; the only tune he ever sang or whistled was 'Streets of Laredo', a tune played as his coffin left St Mary's in 2002. One of those multi-talented men, committed to public service, who are the backbone of any small community. His grandfather, Jacob Napoleon <a href=\"/biographies/goss_jacob\">GOSS</a>, was one of the earliest settlers, and with his father (also William Henry, and remarkably also a ninth child), and with his own longevity (he was 91 when he died) the three generations span almost the whole history of the Falklands.</p>",

He was private secretary to Sir William Robinson, governor of the Windward Islands 1883-5 and again at Trinidad 1885-1891.

        "body": "<p>geologist, was born in New Malden, Surrey on 17 February 1948, the daughter of Jack Greenway and Vera Greenway, née Collett. She first studied geology at Wimbledon High School for Girls, but her interest in landscapes was evident earlier on holidays in Sussex, Jersey, the Lake District and on a schoolgirl expedition to the Faeroe Islands. She read Geology at Exeter University and after a few months at the Directorate of Overseas Surveys joined the British Antarctic Survey at the University of Birmingham. She was to produce a geological map of the Falkland Islands for ODA using primarily aerial photographs (photo-geology), together with previously published material.</p><p>In 1970 fieldwork by British scientists in Antarctica was mainly restricted to summer expeditions for male personnel only! Thus it was thought that analysis and interpretation of air photographs, with no fieldwork but reference to previous work, would suffice for this project. Photo-geology was a new discipline for Greenway, but guidance was available from Birmingham lecturer Phil Garrett.</p><p>Photo-interpretation involves the examination of pairs of overlapping aerial photographs; using a stereoscope (a binocular viewer), the central portion of the view appears three-dimensional, allowing topographical and geological features to be recognised. A series of 1:25,000 photographs was taken in 1956, and every pair of the approximately 2,500 prints covering land was examined. Using a specially devised geological legend, annotations were made first on transparent overlays and then transferred by hand in coloured inks to the 29 topographical base map sheets of the Islands on a scale of 1:50,000 published in 1961-2. All this before computerised or digital mapping! Photo-interpretation started in spring 1970 and took over a year of painstaking and often lonely work by Greenway.</p><p>To confirm the geological formations identified on the photographs but not examined in the field, close reference was made to the map and report of HA <a href=\"/biographies/baker_herbert\">BAKER</a>, who carried out the first geological survey of the islands from 1920-22. Further information was gained from reports of the visits of Charles <a href=\"/biographies/darwin_charles\">DARWIN</a> and other scientists, and from occasional visits by BAS personnel to the Falklands. There was also discussion with colleagues and other experts. Thus the map and report were finalised. The map was published in 1972 as two sheets, West and East, at a scale of 1:250,000, accompanying the official report, <em>The Geology of the Falkland Islands </em>(British Antarctic Survey Scientific Reports No 76). Greenway was awarded an MSc in 1972.</p><p>She never visited the Falkland Islands, but until 1998, hers was the official geological map of the Islands. During the conflict of 1982, the map was used for information about the terrain and other natural features. Indeed, there are reports that it went out of print due to demand at this time!</p><p>After compiling a gazetteer of the Islands published in 1974, Greenway trained as a teacher and spent the next 20 years teaching geology and geography in schools and colleges in the Midlands and Sussex. Brief expeditions followed to Iceland, Norway, the Cairngorms and Snowdonia. In 1983, she married Colin Orchard, an accountant in Brighton, and they had a daughter, Joanna, in 1985.</p><p>During 1996-8, a further geological survey of the Falklands was undertaken by Dr. Don Aldiss, seconded from the British Geological Survey, and Emma Edwards, a Falklands geologist. The new map was published in 1998 and is now the definitive version. The contribution of the 1972 map was acknowledged but additional fieldwork has allowed a much fuller understanding of the geology. Since 1995, Greenway has been writing indexes for books, many of them geological, and she is now a Director of Indexing Specialists (UK) Ltd.</p>",

        "body": "<p><strong>First Generation</strong></p><p>Robert Greenshields, the original colonist (1829-1878), was born in Howgate, Carmichael, Lanarkshire on 11 December 1829, the second son of the six children of Thomas Robert Greenshields and Elizabeth, née Gold.  He seems to have spent his early adult life farming in Argyll - he was a reasonably prosperous shepherd in the 1861 census. In 1855 he married Elizabeth Patterson and by 1865 they had six children Jane (b1855), James (b1856), Robert (b1858), Thomas (b1860), Elizabeth (b1862) and Margaret (b1865). Greenshields had moved to England to farm at Grimsthorpe Park in Lincolnshire when he was engaged by the Falkland Islands Company on a five-year contract as part of a strategy to increase their investment in sheep-farming. At a board meeting on 22 February 1865 the directors of the FIC had resolved 'that a competent man be immediately engaged, at a salary not exceeding £200 per annum, to proceed to the Falklands and take general superintendence and management of the Company's sheep and four or five qualified shepherds be engaged to accompany him'. At their meeting on 6 July the managing director 'read testimonials in favour of Mr. Robert Greenshields for the office of Flockmaster at the Falklands ... the Managing Director reported having had a long conversation with this man and believed him to be a very suitable candidate'. At the following meeting on 14 July:</p><blockquote><blockquote>The Managing Director informed the Board that according to its desire Mr. Robt. Greenshields was offered and had accepted the appointment of Flockmaster at the Falklands and will sail in the  'Julie Tatham' upon the understanding sanctioned by the Board to receive a gratuity of £20 for thus expediting his departure, his salary to be £150 a year with the usual conditions as to House accommodation, Meat and Passages. And upon stipulation, which was conceded, of his receiving £40 advance of salary for his Outfit and his wife being paid £8 a month on account from his salary from 1st September till she is found a passage for Stanley.</blockquote></blockquote><p>Greenshields sailed with his son James on board the <em>Julie Tatham</em> on 21 July 1865, arriving in Stanley on 22 September. In February of the following year his wife Elizabeth, accompanied by their remaining children, sailed from London on the ship <em>Matilda</em>, chartered by the FIC, arriving in Stanley on 27 April. The family went to live at Darwin Harbour and their seventh child, William, was born in 1867.</p><p>Greenshields had arrived at a difficult period in the Company's sheep-farming enterprise. The flocks were ravaged by scab* and there were far too few shepherds to carry out the necessary work of looking after the animals. Losses were becoming unsustainable and Greenshields was expected to reverse the trend in a short time. In 1867 FE COBB arrived to replace James LANE as colonial manager for the FIC and was not impressed by Greenshields' management skills.  'His lenient way of treating the men, \"softness\" is the only word for it,' wrote Cobb, ' is beginning to irritate me and I see it leading to an utter disregard of his authority among the rougher class in the Camp'. In April 1868 he proposed to the directors that Greenshields be replaced by William Wickham  <a href=\"/biographies/bertrand_william\">BERTRAND</a>, newly-arrived from New Zealand, with experience of dealing with scab and moreover 'a sharp decided character, giving the impression that he would stand very little nonsense from his shepherds'. In fact Cobb shortly thereafter made the exchange without waiting for permission from London, allowing Greenshields 'to take the 2nd Corral (Salvador) on shares' by way of compensation.</p><p>However on parting from the FIC, Greenshields immediately took up a section of land north of the San Carlos River on his own account, signing the first 'licence to occupy' on 4 August 1868. In November 1869 Robert and Elizabeth Greenshields had a fifth son, John, by which time Robert had already built a house on the land and stocked it. By some curious provision of the law, he was also able to take out leases on further sections in the names of his sons James and Thomas, although they were still only 13 and 9 years old respectively. By 1871 he had the leases on seven adjoining sections of the North Camp, which he collectively named 'Howgate Station' after his birthplace, although it was later renamed 'Douglas Station' after another village near Carmichael. In the same year he also took a lease on land at Horseshoe Bay. His holdings eventually totalled some 130,000 acres. However a family tragedy marred their success, when their second son Robert died of consumption (tuberculosis) on 13 October 1871, aged only thirteen. They went on to have a further three children: Robert (b1874), George (b1875) and Alexander (b1877).</p><p><strong>The Second Generation</strong></p><p>The elder Robert Greenshields himself died soon after Alexander's birth, on 18 October 1878 of liver disease. He was only 48 years old. In his will, made four days before his death, he left his estate in equal shares to his wife and all his surviving children, adding 'It is my wish that my wife Elizabeth Patterson Greenshields and my eldest son the aforesaid James Greenshields do carry on the business of sheep farming until the youngest child come of age'. James Greenshields duly took over the running of the farm. He was made a JP in 1892.  In 1893 he married Isabella Shirlaw in Scotland and in 1894 they had a son, whom they christened Robert.  In 1896 James Greenshields lost right arm in an accident lasooing a bullock, but continued to farm with as much energy as before. However he too died young. He was drowned with nine others, when a cutter in which they were travelling from Horseshoe Bay to Douglas Station (as the farm was known by then) disappeared in Salvador Water in June of 1898. His body was not found until six months later and he was buried in Stanley Cemetery.  The <em>Church Magazine</em> noted that 'the Islands have lost a good master and a most successful farmer'.</p><p>James had latterly been assisted in the management of the farm by his younger brother George, who took over the reins on James' death. Time had left the family sadly depleted. William had died in 1883 aged 16, Elizabeth in 1885 aged 22, Robert in 1888 aged 14 and Margaret in 1889 aged 24. Thomas had moved to Patagonia to farm there, as had Jane and her husband William Douglas, but both Jane and Thomas died in 1899. George was made a JP in 1905 and in 1916 he married Annie Louisa Benney. Her father William Benney, late owner of Saunders Island, had travelled out to the Falklands in 1865 on the same ship as George's father, Robert. In 1917 Robert Greenshield's widow, Elizabeth, died in London aged 80, leaving the considerable sum of £15,000.</p><p><strong>Thereafter</strong></p><p>By this time James's son Robert had returned to the Falklands from Britain, where he had been educated, with a view to taking over the farm. Robert married Malvina Thomas in Stanley Cathedral on 9 November 1921 and they had two sons, Robert James Thomas (b1923) and Harland (b1928). Robert senior was a keen member of the Falkland Islands Defence Force and Chairman of the Stanley Sports Association. He was made a JP in 1928 and at the outbreak of World War II was promoted to captain in the FIDF and put in charge of the mounted infantry.  He was also Aide de Camp to the governor throughout the war years. He died in 1947. Harland Greenshields, great-grandson of the original Robert Greenshields, eventually took over management of Douglas Station, but sold it in the 1970s. In the 1980s it was subdivided, like many other large Falklands properties. Harland died on his farm in Wales in 1999 and his ashes were flown back to the Islands for burial.</p>",

        "body": "<p>governor, was born on 7 April 1852 in Kent, the youngest son of Andrew Wilson and his wife Charlotte, a granddaughter of the first Earl Grey. He was educated at Cheltenham College and at the young age of 22 benefited from his mother's connections by being appointed as private secretary to Sir William Grey, then governor of Jamaica. His successful career in the Colonial Service included stints as clerk of the Executive and Legislative Councils in British Honduras {Belize}(1878), magistrate in charge of scouts on the Mexican Frontier (1879), special commissioner to take over territory between Sierra Leone and Liberia and assistant colonial secretary, Gold Coast {Ghana}(1884). His association with the South Atlantic began on St Helena where he was first colonial secretary (1886) and then governor (1887-1897).</p><p>He married Margaret Brown in 1884 and they had two sons (Willie and Robin) and one daughter (Sybil), all of whom were young enough to accompany them to the Falkland Islands, where Grey-Wilson was posted as governor in 1897. They arrived in Stanley on 20 October 1897. His early days in the Islands saw him courting controversy when, at a Roman Catholic fundraising event, he spoke of the benefits of disestablishing the Church in the Colonies. At his next appearance at a St Mary's bazaar he was forced to return to the subject to correct the impression given by stating that he was only in favour of disestablishment in so far as it meant that the receipt of state aid - in fact given to all three denominations in the Falklands - would lead to a weakening of self-sufficiency. The need for financial prudence and a preoccupation with financial matters characterised his governorship, whether expressed at school prize-givings by admonishing a tendency to extravagance and urging the duty of thrift or shown in practical reforms by introducing a paper currency in the Falklands and ensuring that the notes were of denominations to suit both Stanley folk and Campers.</p><p>Unfortunately his drive for economy was not practised to such good effect in his determination to reconstruct Government House, where in his own words 'nothing short of heroic measures were needed'. Despite his confidence that local bricks could be made at considerably cheaper rates than imported ones, the contractors struggled and the project ran significantly over-budget, with a total expenditure of £3,574 as opposed to the available £2,500. Although his efforts had to be confined in the end to only one wing, it is to Grey-Wilson that the subsequent governors owe their conservatory, their billiard room and (perhaps more important) their central heating. His role in the creation of today's Government House is commemorated in the naming of a guest bedroom after him.</p><p>Throughout his time in the Falklands Grey-Wilson and his children participated fully in local life, shining on the sporting, rather than in the academic field. The <em>Falkland Islands Magazine  </em>records prizes in tug o'war and egg and spoon races, with participation in paper chases and the Governor himself winning a Badminton tournament. He also contributed to the community in more tangible ways by championing the plan to bring a trained nurse down from the UK, which finally reached fruition in 1902, and by overseeing the formation of the fire brigade in 1898.</p><p>A short-lived contribution to the Falklands was the approval of a new seal for the colony when, at his instigation, the old crest of the ox was replaced as no longer relevant. The <em>Falkland Islands Magazine </em>for July 1903 rather archly describes the design:</p><blockquote><blockquote>At his suggestion, it represents a seal, a penguin and wild geese. The seal is on a rock or iceberg at the left hand side and a penguin is standing up in his usual stately manner at the other side. The sea, fortunately, separates the two, as we are told a seal does not at all object to a penguin for dinner. They have been seen to catch and play with them as a cat does with a mouse, throwing them up into the air out of the water. The geese are flying overhead.</blockquote></blockquote><p>Unfortunately the design received neither formal approval, nor public acclamation and by 1906 Grey-Wilson's successor <a href=\"/biographies/allardyce_sir\">ALLARDYCE</a> reported that it had been discontinued.</p><p>Probably more welcome to Islanders were his efforts to simplify complex legislation, in particular that relating to land, which he carried out to respond to the needs of a largely untrained judiciary.</p><p>He left the Falklands in 1904 to become governor of the Bahamas where he remained until 1912 and continued to champion the ideals of universal unswerving British justice to which his service in the colonies had accustomed him. On his retirement he spent two quiet years in an England where he had not lived for 40 years, but the start of World War I saw him once again responding to his country's call and he became chairman of the Central Committee for National Patriotic Organisations and chairman of the Institute of Patentees. Less predictably he played a leading role in the animal charity, Our Dumb Friends League.</p><p>He was made a CMG in 1891, a KCMG in 1904 and a KBE in 1918 and became a Commander of the Star of Rumania in 1921. He died in San Remo, Italy, on 14 February 1926 and was buried there.</p>",

        "body": "<p>Argentine historian, was born on 15 February 1848 in Toulouse, France, the son of Pierre Groussac and Catherine, née Deval. After an education in the classics, Groussac entered the Brest Naval College (Ecole Navale) in 1865 but left almost immediately, for what he was to say once was 'disobedience'. Groussac then abandoned his native France altogether and travelled to Argentina, arriving penniless and unable to speak Spanish in February 1866. He worked first as an agricultural labourer but with help from a friend, Pedro Goyena, he published a remarkable literary work in Spanish on the romantic poet Don José de Espronceda. This astonished everyone and in 1871 the minister of education offered him a teaching post in the province of Tucuman. He stayed there twelve years, during which time he married and had a family.</p><p>In 1883, he went back to his native France for a visit; but promptly returned to Argentina in 1884 to take up the post of national inspector of secondary education. Just a year later, in January 1885, he was offered and accepted the post of director of the National Library in Buenos Aires. This was a controversial appointment, as there were better-qualified Argentine candidates for this important position and Groussac was very probably chosen because of his links with the party of President Julio Argentino <a href=\"/biographies/roca_julio\">ROCA</a>.</p><p>Groussac was an aggressive and irascible man and this is apparent in all his literary works. One of these was his book <em>Les Isles Malouines </em>published in 1910 in French, on the hundredth anniversary of Argentina's Revolution of May. This was a bitterly anti-British and one-sided book which misinterpreted some of the events of 1770 and 1771 - the Spanish seizure and restoration of Port Egmont. Groussac paid minimal attention to the American involvement in the events of 1831 to 1833, which in fact he knew all about. It was as if Groussac the immigrant was more determined to press his adopted country's case than a native might have been. His book was written before the Vernet papers were donated to the Argentine archives and Groussac makes no reference to them or to Vernet's pro-British sentiments. Nor did he consult the British state papers.</p><p>Groussac remained head of the National Library until his death on 27 June 1929, by which time he was blind. His influence endured: he had been a friend of the Argentine politician Dr Alfredo <a href=\"/biographies/palacios_alfredo\">PALACIOS</a>, who later founded the Committee to Recover the Falklands. In 1934, Palacios promoted the passage of a law ordering Groussac's book on the Falklands to be translated into Spanish and distributed to all libraries and schools in Argentina. The translated books arrived in the schools in 1937 and Groussac's version of events entered the Argentine national history syllabus and played a crucial role in reviving Argentina's claim to the Falklands. In his memory, Port William, Stanley's outer harbour, has now been renamed Port Groussac in the Argentine canon of shadow placenames.</p>",

        "body": " <p>visiting economist, was born on 2 July 1890 at Calne (Wilts), the son of Ernest Guillebaud, an Anglican priest; his mother Mabel Marshall was sister to the economist Alfred Marshall. Educated at Repton School, Manchester University and St Johns College Cambridge, he was awarded a double first in Economics and received the Adam Smith Prize in 1915. He was elected to a fellowship at St Johns in 1915 and was a lecturer in economics there from 1926 until 1945 and director of studies in economics from 1935 until 1957. Guillebaud married Marie-Thérèse Prunner (born in Austria and known as Pauline) in 1918; they had two daughters Philomena and Claudia . He maintained that his name should be pronounced to rhyme with 'keel row'.</p><p>Between the two World Wars, Guillebaud led a quiet life as a university don for nearly twenty years, but in 1939 he entered public life as a government advisor on economic affairs, where the hallmark of his meticulous work was the lucidity of his decisions and explanations. Guillebaud gained a reputation of being a fair-minded man who gave unbiased advice and who knew that the truth can be unpopular. He became a specialist in wages arbitration disputes and conciliation, and also member of many industrial disputes tribunals. He was described as 'the apostle of goodwill between employers and the employed'. Guillebaud was created a CBE in 1948. He conducted an economic survey of the sisal industry of Tanganyika {Tanzania} in 1967.</p><p>Guillebaud came to Stanley on 4 March 1967 at the personal invitation of Governor <a href=\"/biographies/haskard_cosmo\">HASKARD</a>, appointed to conduct an economic survey of the Falkland Islands. He left the Islands on 9 April 1967, and his report was submitted on 30 June 1967. He stayed on ten farms during his stay, and he consulted widely - including with FG <a href=\"/biographies/mitchell_francis\">MITCHELL</a>, the managing director of FIC. His report dealt with many economic issues - especially the prospects for diversification of the Islands' economy, the national income, the standard of living and levels of remuneration. He also wrote extensively on public finances and population trends.</p><p>Guillebaud understood his limitations:</p><blockquote><blockquote>Writing as an economist with no special knowledge of the technical problems of sheep farming, I must rely mainly on the opinion of experts who have made detailed studies of the system of sheep husbandry as practised in the Falkland Islands.</blockquote></blockquote><p>He accepted the findings of Hugh <a href=\"/biographies/munro_hugh\">MUNRO</a> and William <a href=\"/biographies/davies_william\">DAVIES</a> concluding that from 1909 to 1963 there had been no expansion in the total amount of exported wool produced in the Islands though he acknowledged that there has been a considerable rise in the average yield of wool per sheep - an increase of 22% in the period 1944-1963. He found not just an absence of real improvement, but also a gradual deterioration of the pastures under the largely prevailing system of uncontrolled grazing, with a consequential decline in the carrying capacity in terms of sheep on the farms. The increase in the yield of wool per sheep was undoubtedly due to improved methods of breeding.</p><p>Guillebaud asked the familiar question: 'what can be done to improve the fertility of the soil, and so enable a larger number of sheep to be carried successfully?' From the work of Munro and Davies, he drew three conclusions: first, that there was impressive unanimity of expert opinion that sub-division of the Camps was an essential prerequisite to any improvement in the condition of the grasslands; second, that all the writers since 1924 were agreed that the fertility and carrying capacity had been deteriorating and was continuing to do so; third, that with a few exceptions, remarkably little progress had been made during the period 1920-1960 towards sub-division and fencing of pastures, and other practical measures for conserving or improving the fertility of the soil.</p><p>Guillebaud sought to explain why this situation had occurred; he understood fully the problems caused by low wool prices before 1939-1945, and that since the end of World War II profits had been used to build up reserves or in much needed, but expensive, improvement in the housing of the farm employees. 'But this notwithstanding they could and should have done more to sub-divide their large enclosures.' He commended the re-seeding efforts of various farms, but was disappointed by the overall record of the FIC farms which were still 'being ranched in the old way.' The FIC strongly disagreed with his conclusion; Guillebaud conceded that while he was writing his report FIC were resuming re-seeding experiments on some farms and commented that 'this sort of experiment, which might produce instructive results ... shows a very welcome, if belated, change in the policy of the Company'.</p><p>The errors of the disastrous Ajax Bay freezer scheme were outlined in Guillebaud's report:</p><blockquote><blockquote>It cannot be said that anyone emerged with much credit from this sorry story ... neither Government which was reluctant to accept advice or criticism from within the islands; nor the farmers whose co-operation left much to be desired; nor the Colonial Development Corporation which made very bad mistakes in the planning, construction and administration of the scheme.</blockquote></blockquote><p>Guillebaud's main conclusions were: that the Agricultural Research Council of the UK should be asked to send a grasslands expert to suggest the best methodology to be used on grassland research; that there should be an increase in the numbers of cattle kept on sheep farms; that the wages paid in Stanley and wages paid in Camp should be more closely and fairly aligned; that there should be an increase in Profits Taxation, but that farm owners should be able to offset their increased tax liabilities against any capital expenditure investment in grassland improvements; that there should be changes to the tax rates and there should be an examination of the securities in which the Public Fund was invested; that high priority should be given to constructing an airstrip near Stanley and the establishment of an air-link with South America; that significant improvements in education on the Falkland Islands were required and that larger contributions from government to off-set costs of the further education of children outside the Islands were needed; that the establishment of tenant farms was necessary and that other ways should be found to give employees some financial interest in the farms; that reassurance should be given to Islanders about the political future of 'their country'; that the Government should subsidise the passage of wives and families of men recruited to work on the farms, and that government should subsidise the cost of improving the accommodation for married people working on farms; that sheep farm owners should greatly improve their methods of recruitment; and that if the labour situation in Stanley did not rapidly improve, contract labour from Chile should be obtained.</p><p>It is striking that Guillebaud, despite being commissioned to report on the economy of the Colony, concerned himself with a wide range of social issues, with the reasons behind the steady decline in the human population of the Islands, and with how this could be halted. He finishes his report in a typically far-sighted manner:</p><blockquote><blockquote>I wish to express my personal belief and faith in the viability of the Falkland Islands' economy. But resolute action will be needed if a situation, which today is merely somewhat precarious, is to be prevented from reaching a stage when it becomes irreparable. It is not too much to say that the whole future of the Colony is now at stake.</blockquote></blockquote><p>Guillebaud died on 23 August 1971 in Cambridge after a prolonged illness. His wife died on 20 May 1974.</p>",

        "body": " <p>Spanish naval officer, was born in Cartagena (Spain) in 1780. On 20 December 1793 he entered the College of Navigation in the Cartagena Comandancia de Pilotos, aged 13, qualifying as a  <em>pilotín* </em>on 22 April 1795. He started his career in the Mediterranean, operating with armed launches off Algeciras, Malaga and Cartagena, during which he proved his mettle as a reliable and fearless leader. On 20 May 1796 Guillén joined the frigate  <em>Santa Dorotea,  </em>but on 10 August he was appointed to the 34 gun frigate  <em>Mahonesa </em>. On 13 October 1796 the  <em>Mahonesa </em>was captured, between Cabo de Gata and Cartagena, by the 32 gun British frigate  <em>Terpsichore,  </em>Captain Richard Bowen. Guillén was put ashore at Algeciras and served for some time on look-out duties in the Strait of Gibraltar. On 8 July 1798, he rejoined the frigate  <em>Santa Dorotea  </em>which was to form part of a squadron of four frigates taking reinforcements and specie to the Algiers garrison. Lieutenant José de San Martín the future 'Libertador' of South America was one of the junior officers on board. On 15 July 1798, the squadron was intercepted by the British 64 gun  <em>Lion,  </em>Captain Manley Dixon, but after a battle lasting two hours the  <em>Dorotea </em>was forced to surrender. Guillén and the other Spanish officers were taken prisoner, but later released on parole, on condition they would not engage in hostilities against England during the war, which Guillén spent teaching mathematics at the Academia de Pilotos in Cartagena. He would never see San Martín again as the two men ended up on different sides during the wars between Spanish loyalists and South American patriots. On 22 January 1805 Guillén was promoted  <em>segundo piloto </em>in the  <em>Cuerpo de Pilotos </em>, and in 1808 he was appointed, in charge of navigation, to the frigate  <em>Proserpina </em>,  <em>Capitán de navío </em>José María de Salazar, when she conveyed the viceroy elect of the River Plate from Cádiz to Montevideo.</p><p>On 30 August 1809 Guillén was given command of the  <em>sumaca </em>*  <em>Carlota </em>, with a complement of 46, and at the same time appointed  <em>comandante gobernador </em>and  <em>ministro de la real hacienda </em>(paymaster of the royal treasury) of the Islas Malvinas, where at Puerto de la Soledad (Port Louis), on 10 January 1810, he relieved Gerardo <a href=\"/biographies/bondas_gerardo\">BONDAS</a>. Guillén brought to the settlement news of the terrible events that had convulsed the Iberian Peninsula, with possible momentous repercussions in the Americas. On his arrival he set out to maintain continuity in government, to sustain the activities in the settlement, and to provide for the maintenance of its installations. He encouraged seal hunting, resulting in reasonable quantities of oil being produced for possible sale in Montevideo. However, the revolution in Buenos Aires on 25 May 1810 caused the overthrow of viceregal government and led to the political separation of Argentina and the Banda Oriental, later to become Uruguay, where the administration had remained for the time being loyal to the crown. In that critical situation the naval authorities in Montevideo had to decide what to do in the Falklands. At the request of Salazar, senior naval officer in Montevideo, a meeting of the Junta Militar Asesora was called by the governor of Montevideo, and held on 8 January 1811. Salazar, a respected organizer, warned that navigational conditions made it imperative for the Junta to decide on an immediate course of action, bearing in mind that to maintain a presence in Puerto de la Soledad would require the despatch of a vessel with 40 or 44 men and 18 months supplies at a total cost of 20,000 pesos. Since there was no money, Salazar proposed withdrawal and so it was decided. That same day  <em>Segundo piloto </em>Manuel Moreno, commanding the armed brig  <em>Gálvez </em>, was instructed to sail to the Falklands without delay. Because Guillén was junior to Moreno, Salazar instructed him that, while he was to take precedence in all matters relating to the settlement, he was to obey orders from Moreno once at sea.</p><p>Acting on the instructions received from Montevideo, Guillén's last official duty as governor at Puerto de la Soledad was to draw up and sign a solemn declaration witnessed and signed by the chaplain of the  <em>Carlota </em>and by Moreno. The signatories stated that the coat of arms of Spain had been placed in the bell tower of the chapel and a lead tablet inscribed with the following declaration of sovereignty:</p><blockquote><blockquote>This Island with its harbours, buildings, dependencies and all they contain are the property of the Colony of our Lord Don Fernando 7o legitimate King of Spain and its Indies, and of Soledad de Malvinas.</blockquote></blockquote><p>As a loyalist Guillén remained in command of the  <em>Carlota </em>and in the next five years he took part in a number of actions in the River Plate region until he returned to Spain, where the  <em>Carlota  </em>was paid off in Cádiz on 7 May 1815. By a royal order of 17 April 1812 Guillén had earlier been transferred to the  <em>Cuerpo General </em>and promoted  <em>alférez de fragata </em>. He continued to serve in the Spanish navy until he died on 12 May 1839 in Cuba in the rank of <em>teniente de navío. </em></p>",

During this commission he investigated the behaviour of the Peru Coastal Current followed by a trawling survey of the Patagonian continental shelf from 53°-42°S. He was based in Stanley and returned there between cruises.</p><p>His third visit south was for whale marking near South Georgia from December 1936-February 1937. He enjoyed the social life in the Falklands and contributed by 'garnishing' the Town Hall for dances, borrowing plants, flags and other decorative materials. He visited many Falkland settlements, West Point and Hill Cove, riding to Fitzroy, collecting pebbles at Pebble Island and writing diary style letters home (1500 quarto pages in 1925-27) which described every detail of Falkland and ship life. In March 1927 the William Scoresby took shelter in Albemarle harbour as the captain was anxious about water supplies. Gunther, always physically very active, announced at lunch that he would walk to Port Stephens to see whether fresh water was available. He returned on horseback by moonlight. A keen naturalist and observer, he painted watercolours and drew throughout his time there, with an insistence on scientific accuracy. It shows in his drawings of whales in the <em>Discovery Report Vol XXV </em>and in the illustrations to <em>Notes and Sketches </em>reprinted from the Draconian. He contributed to five Discovery reports including one completed by TJ Hart which was based on Gunther's manuscript.</p><p>After returning to England he once again worked at the museum writing up all the work done at sea. As a member of the Territorial Army he was called up at the outbreak of war and commissioned 2nd Lt in the 72nd Anti-aircraft Regt RA. In May 1940 he was stationed near North Walsham in Norfolk. When approaching Barton Turf on foot to check that someone was not signalling to the enemy at sea he called at a cottage to read his map and obtain directions to the suspect house. The resident, a Special Constable, directed him on foot, cycled to the house by another route and borrowed a gun from the newly armed Home Guard. Gunther reached the house. The Constable returned with some further Home Guard members and after asking Gunther to hand over his gun, accidentally shot him in the upper leg. He bled to death in Norwich hospital on 31 May 1940. He was awarded the Polar Medal, bronze, posthumously.</p>",

His father was a self-employed shoe repairer and leather merchant and life was a struggle with Ted, whose education started at elementary school at the age of five, working for a local doctor before and after school at 12 years of age for a weekly wage of 7s 6d (37½p).</p><p>He left school at 14 and, after initially working for his father, in 1936 became an electrical trainee with Kingston Corporation and studied electrical engineering in the evening, gaining ordinary and higher certificates. The outbreak of war saw Gutteridge classified in a reserved occupation, but in 1941 he released himself by volunteering for aircrew duties with the RAF. However persistent airsickness led him to be grounded and transferred to Transport Command. Following demobilisation, he resumed work with Kingston Corporation but in the latter part of 1947 was accepted by the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey for service in the Antarctic. With his knowledge of electrics and radio he joined a team of scientists - geologists, meteorologists and others. Whilst in the Antarctic, at the base in the South Shetlands, a powerful Argentine naval squadron arrived in February 1948 and in accordance with procedure a formal note of protest had to be lodged for visiting British territorial waters without permission. The Base Leader, a former naval officer, took him along with him to lodge the protest with the Argentine Admiral, travelling in a leaking dory with Gutteridge much discomfited by being forced to wear two left-sided waders, the only ones available. His hilarious account of this venture appeared in the Falkland Islands Journal of 1999.</p><p>The Falkland Islands Governor, Sir Miles <a href=\"/biographies/clifford_sir\">CLIFFORD</a>, took a close interest in the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey and when it became necessary to replace Stanley's power system, and once he had acquired the equipment on advantageous terms, it was natural that he should arrange to have Gutteridge transferred to Stanley to become superintendent, Power and Electrical Department, following additional training in the UK. He held this appointment until 1973 when he retired to the UK. He was an immensely popular figure in the Islands, not only running an efficient electrical service but also participating in local affairs, becoming a Justice of the Peace. He married Dorothy Margaret Sedgwick, an Islander, in 1960 and they had one son, Tom, born in 1963. After retirement, he worked for the Crown Agents, travelling extensively throughout the Commonwealth, continuing part-time on a self-employed basis from the age of 60 through to age 65<em>. </em>He was honoured with an MBE in 1977.</p>",

After demobilisation in 1946 he won a scholarship to Aberdeen University and from 1947-1949 studied there for the Agricultural Diploma. He then joined Scottish Agricultural Industries as their north-east Scotland representative and worked with them until 1953.</p><p>An advertisement in his local newspaper prompted him to apply for a job in the Falkland Islands as a travelling teacher employed by the Falkland Islands Company.

His father, Carl Otto Gustafson was a shopkeeper, and his mother was Eva Cornelia née Larsson. His elementary schooling was followed by secondary grammar school in Jönköping where he developed a strong interest in science and in particular botany. In 1903 he began studies at Uppsala University graduating in 1906 with a Bachelor of Science in geology. In 1911 he received the title of Doctor of Philosophy from the University of Uppsala for his work on the geology of the Falkland Islands and in the same year was appointed docent at Stockholm University.</p><p>Halle began a long association with the Swedish Museum on Natural History in 1907 under the tutelage of the renowned palaeobotanist Professor AG Nathorst. In 1914 he was employed at the museum, and on the 22 February 1918 he succeeded Nathorst as head of the Department of Palaeobotany. Between 1921 and 1947 Halle was also director of the Swedish Museum of Natural History before he retired in 1950. Halle was active in other fields and served as vice-secretary to the Swedish Academy of Sciences. In 1930 he received an honorary Doctorate from the University of Cambridge for his contributions to Palaeobotany. In particular Halle is best know for his seminal works describing the first Mesozoic flora from the Antarctic, floras from Patagonia and his most famous work of 1927 on the Permian floras of China. Halle was one of the worlds leading palaeobotanists, who was respected as an excellent morphologist and for the development of new techniques to study fossil material. Halle married Helga Elvira Westman (b1898) on 24 November 1921; they had at least one son. On 12 May 1964 Halle passed away at Saltsjöbaden, Nacka, (Sweden).</p><p>Halle's association with the Falklands arose through investigations made on the Swedish South Polar Expedition (1901-1903). The discoveries by Prof JG <a href=\"/biographies/andersson_johan\">ANDERSSON</a> raised Halle's interest in the geological history of this region and on 26 October 1907 Halle arrived in the Falklands at Port Stanley as part of CJF <a href=\"/biographies/skottsberg_carl\">SKOTTSBERG</a>'s Swedish Magellanic Expedition. He spent several months in the Falkland Islands and departed on 12 February 1908. During this time the expedition travelled widely in the Falkland Islands through the generous offer of free passage on the Falkland Island Company ships. The expedition visited Saunders Island, Roy Cove, Fox Bay, Speedwell Island, Darwin Harbour, Port Howard, Hill Cove, Port Philomel, Halfway Cove, and many other places. These were often used as bases for trips into the hinterland. Halle mentioned that he was based at Mr Allan's home in Darwin Harbour for all his trips across Lafonia. The geological investigations and collections made as part of the Skottsberg Expedition formed the basis for Halle's PhD thesis which was published under the title <em>On the Geological Structure and History of the Falkland Islands </em>in 1911. Some of the main findings were the extent of the Permo-Carboniferous glacial beds, extensive <em>Glossopteris </em>fossils from Lafonia, and the discovery of <em>in situ </em>forest horizons on West Point Island. This comprehensive work with its associated geological map formed the main body of knowledge about the geology of the Islands for the next 62 years until <em>The Geology of the Falkland Islands </em>was published as a British Antarctic Survey Scientific report (No 76) in 1972.</p>",

        "body": " <p>colonial surgeon, became a member of the Royal College of Surgeons in February 1835, and practised in Walsall, Warwickshire. One night when the Whig grandee Lord Stanley was passing through Walsall, his seven year old son and heir was taken ill and Hamblin was sent for. The treatment was so successful that Hamblin felt able, in 1842, to remind Stanley, then secretary of state for the colonies, of his debt - it may be that Hamblin felt it healthy to leave Walsall after a planned duel with a local solicitor had been interrupted by the police.</p><p>In November 1842 Stanley saw little prospect of offering Hamblin a job, but Governor MOODY's request for a doctor in the tiny colony of Port Louis was received shortly thereafter, and in April 1843, Hamblin was offered the post of colonial surgeon in the Islands at a salary of £300 pa. He arrived in Port Louis on 23 November 1843 in the schooner <em>Columbian Packet,  </em>accompanied by his wife, Elizabeth Hamblin, née Longden, his two children (Louisa Jane and FH) plus his mother-in-law, Louisa Longden and her son James <a href=\"/biographies/longden_sir\">LONGDEN</a> who was about to begin a long successful career in colonial administration.</p><p>Hamblin had to spend the first three months in the colony in a tent, but he had bought a plot for £50 in the new settlement of Stanley (named after his patron) and erected one of the first private houses in the town: it still stands - Stanley Cottage. Governor Moody, a bachelor with Government House only half built, moved in with the family and clearly relished home comforts. He appointed Hamblin his aide-de-camp and later appointed him to ExCo. Moody's intimacy with the Hamblins aroused the jealousy of the surveyor, Murrell Robinson <a href=\"/biographies/robinson_murrell\">ROBINSON</a> and provoked an incident in the government offices in March 1845 (see entry for Robinson). Commander <a href=\"/biographies/sulivan_sir\">SULIVAN</a>, who was in port at the time, noted dryly: 'The wife of the doctor is a clever rather nice person and I believe she is at the bottom of it all for the doctor himself is one of the last men that would suit the Govr. He has neither ability nor intelligence enough to do so'.</p><p>Hamblin's closeness to Moody meant that most of his appeals for extra fees, for inspecting ships' companies and similar tasks, were turned down by the Colonial Office, who suspected the governor of special pleading. Apart from occasional accidents, the Falklands had a healthy climate, although Hamblin's patients increased with the arrival of the military pensioners and other immigrants. His own health suffered and he took fifteen months sick leave in 1852-3. An appeal to be transferred to another colony was rejected and he returned to the Islands in the <em>Chester </em>on 2 December 1853.</p><p>His health continued to decline: a particularly gruelling incident followed the wreck of the barque <em>Cubana </em>in 1862, where Hamblin performed seven amputations on four survivors. In 1863 he applied for premature pensioned retirement. Governor <a href=\"/biographies/mackenzie_james\">MACKENZIE</a> wrote in his support: 'this gentleman has earned the good opinion of successive governors under whom he has served, for his efficient and assiduous discharge of his duties while his kindness and professional skill have obtained the gratitude and confidence of the entire community.' In the event his health failed and he sailed for home without approval from London. He died at sea on 23 June 1864. His wife pleaded, unsuccessfully, for a government pension. A memorial in Stanley Cathedral to commemorate his work was rescued from the original church, demolished after the peat slip of 1886. A stamp in the 1995 foundation of Stanley series, designed by James Peck, is dedicated to Hamblin: his portrait is necessarily vague as no pictures of him survive.</p>",

        "body": "<p>government naturalist, was born in Liverpool on 26 May 1891. After graduating from Liverpool University in 1913 Hamilton spent two summers working in Ireland investigating the biological problems associated with the whaling station which was located at Belmullet Bay, Co Mayo. In 1914 he was awarded a M.Sc. for his work in oceanography. He joined the Territorial Army at the beginning of World War I, but was discharged because of his flat feet. Hamilton became an assistant demonstrator at Kings College, London and subsequently at The Queen's University, Belfast.</p><p>In 1916 Hamilton joined the Royal Army Medical Corps as a bacteriologist, and in 1919 he moved to the Falkland Islands upon his appointment as magistrate for West Falkland Island and the South Shetlands. He was appointed government naturalist in January 1921. Hamilton made the first attempt to assess the numbers of Fur Seals in the Falkland Islands in 1919. His report gives a highly graphic account of his activities, but it is remarkably imprecise about seal populations. The lack of accuracy of Hamilton's seal counts was to have serious consequences in later years, when successive administrations fixed the level of sealing quotas for Sea Lions and Elephant Seals too high. Fur Seal numbers were estimated to be 5,500 in total and insufficient to support an industry - particularly as substantial poaching by Chilean ships of Fur Seals was still occurring. Hamilton recommended that a 3-inch naval gun be placed on Elephant Jason Island to deter poachers. He urged strong protection measures for the Fur Seal, but added that the numbers of Sea Lions were such that they 'are a field for industrial development.' The Seal Fishery (Consolidation) Ordinance 1921 was introduced. Seal fishery officers were appointed in 1922 and armed officers were placed at major rookeries during the breeding season. Fur sealing was prohibited. HMCS <em>Afterglow </em>was purchased to assist with protection of the rookeries. There were worries in the Colony that the cost of this protection could not be met from the revenues of the sealing industry.</p><p>Hamilton was appointed Falkland Islands Dependencies administrator in 1921 and was resident on Deception Island (part of the South Shetland Islands group) during several whaling seasons. He oversaw the whaling operations of a number of floating factories and one shore station. During his first whaling season (1920/1921) the shore line in the vicinity of the whaling station subsided as the result of volcanic activity, and 'the water in the harbour boiled removing the paint from the hulls of vessels moored there'.</p><p>In 1922 Hamilton warned about the increasing rarity of the Striated Caracara (Johnny Rook) ( <em>Phalcoboenus australis </em>) as the result of the Government policy of culling birds of prey and the payment of a bounty for their beaks. In April 1923 Governor <a href=\"/biographies/middleton_sir\">MIDDLETON</a> wrote to the Secretary of State expressing concern about the diminishing numbers of Fur Seals in the Falkland Islands. Hamilton visited Elephant Jason Island, Bird Island and Volunteer Rocks from October 1922 to March 1923, and his report showed that although the exact number of Fur Seals could not be stated with complete accuracy, nevertheless the numbers were far fewer than had been indicated in earlier reports.</p><p>Hamilton believed that the presence of large numbers of Sea Lions on or near the hauling or breeding places of the Fur Seal was most undesirable and that steps should be taken to remove them. There should be no difficulty in doing this if the Sea Lions were driven to the edge of the rocks and shot there or in the water.</p><p>He concluded that Fur Seal numbers were now so low that the Islands would be unable to support the costs of a protection scheme within a reasonable time: 'At £3 per skin an annual yield of 1,496 skins would be necessary and this implies a herd of over 30,000 Fur Seals, and highly polygamous at that'.</p><p>During his period of secondment to the Discovery Expeditions Hamilton was engaged on several research projects, and he published a number of papers in various scientific journals. His most important work concerned the Southern Sea Lion ( <em>Otaria byronia </em>) <em> </em>and the Leopard Seal ( <em>Hydrunga leptonyx </em>) <em> </em>(see: Discovery Reports 1939). He was awarded a doctorate for his work on Sea Lions. His period of service with the Discovery Expeditions was not wholly successful or happy. He had a number of strong disagreements with the Scientific Director - Stanley <a href=\"/biographies/kemp_stanley\">KEMP</a>. The Minutes of the Discovery Committee record that:</p><blockquote><blockquote>Dr. Kemp expressed the view that Hamilton's inability to work harmoniously with his colleagues rendered it difficult to utilise his services in any senior capacity commensurate with his salary; and the Committee were inclined to the opinion that the best course would be for Mr Hamilton to revert to Colonial employment on the occurrence of a suitable vacancy.</blockquote></blockquote><p>Kemp opposed Hamilton's application for the post of Senior Scientist in 1928.</p><p>In 1939 the Falkland Islands Government investigated the possibility that trout from Tierra del Fuego could be successfully introduced to the Islands. Hamilton actively supported the introduction of trout citing the example of what had been done in Tierra del Fuego in 1935, where a successful introduction of trout had been made. In 1940 small quantities of the fertilised ova of Brown Trout ( <em>Salmo trutta </em>), <em> </em>American Brook Trout ( <em>Salvelinus fontinalis </em>) <em> </em>and Rainbow Trout ( <em>Oncorhynchus mykiss </em>) <em> </em>were imported from Chile and incubated by Hamilton in a small hatchery at Moody Brook. The Brook and Rainbow Trout ova died, but the Brown Trout survived and were introduced into the Moody Brook, and possibly to the Murrell River.</p><p>During the late 1930s Hamilton became increasingly concerned with the preservation of the remaining stocks of whales. He continued throughout World War II to send annual reports of the activities of the whalers on South Georgia. He warned on 30 September 1942 that:</p><blockquote><blockquote>The Fin Whale is the important (commercially) species - 1,189 were taken, 585 males and 604 females, but only 471 of the combined sexes were adults, that is 39·6%. Sixty one or 27·3% of the adult females were pregnant. The decrease in the percentage of adults has been in progress for some years ... the continuing reduction is a strong indication of similar decreases in stocks ... the herd is becoming thinned out to such an extent that adult females have less chance in becoming pregnant and therefore replenishing the stock. On the whole one cannot take an optimistic view of the future of this species.</blockquote></blockquote><p>The Colonial Office was alarmed at Hamilton's despatch and it commented: 'The Government Naturalist's report shows a very significant and disturbing position as to the stocks of Fin Whales'. As a result of Hamilton's reports the Colonial Office commissioned CF Hickling to prepare a brief summary of the situation as a starting point for the debate about the future of Southern Ocean whaling. His report was prepared with the assistance of Hamilton and contained a stark warning:</p><blockquote><blockquote>It will indeed be a world tragedy if the whale stocks of the south have suffered the same fate as those of the north; and those of us who have been warning of the danger of over-fishing during the inter-war years will get no satisfaction at all from the fulfilment of our warnings ... We can only hope that this coming season will give results which will belie those of last season ... Why won't the business people heed the warnings of the scientist until it is too late?</blockquote></blockquote><p>Some British government officials did not take Hamilton or Hickling's warning seriously. A conference held at the Ministry of Agriculture Fisheries and Food on 1 December 1942 considered the matter of the postwar whaling industry. Despite Hamilton's warnings, and his considerable local knowledge, the conference concluded: 'It was considered desirable that the whaling industry should be got to work as soon as possible on the conclusion of the war'.</p><p>With the support of Governor <a href=\"/biographies/clifford_sir\">CLIFFORD</a>, Hamilton began to investigate the prospects for fishing in the Falkland Islands. Clifford commented:</p><blockquote><blockquote>I tried to get this [fishing research] done with Dr. H [Hamilton] in charge of a three-year experiment. Boats were obtained, and the services of a professional fisherman secured. But the Discovery Committee turned down the scheme. It was great mistake for which the Colony will pay.</blockquote></blockquote><p>In 1944 Hamilton wrote a long memorandum about the prospects for a future fishing industry in the Falkland Islands. It was the first local attempt to consider the economic potential of fishing - albeit coastal rather than offshore fishing. Hamilton acknowledged that very little was known about inshore fisheries outside the work of the Discovery <em> </em>Investigations. He proposed a five-year research project to be funded by a grant (possibly from the Discovery Committee). The objects of the research were to be to increase the supply of fish locally, and to examine export potential. Hamilton wished to 'develop a fish eating habit' amongst the Islands population. He proposed, initially, to use the  <em>Penguin </em>(a 15·8m former government steam launch) and he stated that 'the real reason for the shortage [of fish] is the lack of capital to purchase adequate equipment and the absence of any fishing tradition'.</p><p>Hamilton recommended the investigation of the potential of Mullet, 'Sprat Herring', Rock Cod, Mussels and Krill; Mullet could be taken with seine nets. Hamilton recalled that Vernet exported 80 tonnes of salted fish from Port Louis in the early nineteenth century, and that since then fishing had been a spasmodic affair - or a pastime amusement. Capital costs were calculated to be £4,900 and the recurrent costs would be £6,300 annually:</p><blockquote><blockquote>There are no fishermen in the Falkland Islands, and an essential part of the proposed scheme will be the training of apprentices in the care and construction of gear and the art of fishing. It is hoped that in this way a skilled nucleus may be created capable not only of carrying on an industry which may be established by the research but also of founding that tradition upon which all permanent fisheries depend.</blockquote></blockquote><p>The proposal was forwarded to the Colonial Office in 1946. The project was opposed by some people in the Falkland Islands on grounds of 'non-essentiality'; On 17 June 1948 Governor Clifford telegraphed the Secretary of State that 'fishing ... would never take the place of mutton'. The Colonial Office approved a revised scheme costing £9,100 and funding was made available from the Colonial Development and Welfare Fund. A suitable 9·2m fishing vessel was found but, after protracted negotiations, Governor Clifford had second thoughts, the purchase was not completed and the scheme was abandoned. This illustrates the difficulties of development in the colony, post-World War II, due to the lack of finance within the Falkland Islands and the unwillingness of the British Government to undertake substantial investment in the Colony.</p><p>In 1931 Hamilton married Rose Purdie. During World War II Hamilton was greatly involved in the political and social life of the Falkland Islands. At various times he served as registrar-general, police magistrate and a temporary member of LegCo. The post of government naturalist was abolished in 1949, as an economy measure, and Hamilton retired on pension on 8 November 1949. After his retirement from government service Hamilton continued to make outspoken comments about the level of over-fishing of the remaining whale stocks. He also continued to live in the Falkland Islands, where 'he carried on with his collecting and zoological work.' He enjoyed camping out in remote spots to observe the wild life, a favourite destination being  Cape Dolphin. His time spent studying the cormorant colony there earned him the local nickname 'Shag Hamilton'.</p><p>Hamilton was assisted in his work as the government naturalist by Arthur George <a href=\"/biographies/bennett_arthur\">BENNETT</a>, who acted as assistant government naturalist, from 1922 until 1938. Their relationship was sometimes a little strained. During a visit to Deception Island Hamilton (not known for his tidiness) insisted on dissecting a seal in Bennett's office (who was acting as postmaster and magistrate at the time) and the mess and stench were such that Bennett was forced to find other accommodation for the remainder of the whaling season. The two men collected much rare cetacean material which was subsequently deposited in the Natural History Museum in London. The specimens were accompanied by very detailed notes and data. In 1933 Hamilton and Bennett successfully prevented the introduction of Patagonian Fox ( <em>Dusicyon griseus griseus </em>) to New Island and Carcass Island. Jason Hansen had made the request to introduce the fox in order to 'control the Upland Geese, to kill rats and rabbits and for the production of fur skins.' Hamilton and Bennett advised the Governor that: 'the introduction of any form of new life is a danger in any country, and too often proves the cure is worse than the disease'.</p><p>He was awarded the Polar Medal in 1943 and was appointed to the Imperial Service Order in 1948. Hamilton died suddenly on 15 April 1957 and is buried in Stanley cemetery. He enjoyed 'the rough conditions of life' during his expeditions, and he was often found in the more remote parts of the Falkland Islands. 'He enjoyed the company of sealers and whalers, among whom he had many friends'.</p>",

        "body": "<p>sheep farmer and landholder, was born in Janetstown, Wick, Caithness, on 15 March 1858, the oldest son of four children of Angus Hamilton and Catherine Sutherland. John Hamilton emigrated to the Falklands in 1880 under contract to the Falkland Islands Company; when his contract expired in 1885, he sailed to Chile and worked at Oazy Harbour, northeast of Punta Arenas. In 1889 he formed a partnership with Thomas Saunders to create estancias (sheep farms) near the Argentine city of Río Gallegos. With Saunders and other Scotsmen, he took nearly two years to drive several thousand sheep and horses overland from Buenos Aires province.</p><p>In 1904, Hamilton married Olivia Heap, a Scotswoman who had been a nurse at the British Hospital in Buenos Aires. They had two daughters, Olivia Sutherland (who married a Scotsman in Punta Arenas) and Penelope (who married an Argentine).</p><p>Even as his Argentine properties prospered, Hamilton kept a close watch on the Falklands and, when opportunities arose, he began to acquire property there. In 1922, for instance, he bought Beaver Island and adjacent islets from Richard Waldron Thornhill of Punta Arenas, who had inherited them from an uncle. Shortly thereafter he purchased Weddell Island and the Passage Islands, and attempted to buy the Jason Islands. Government objections prevented his buying the Jasons, which were Crown Reserves, but he managed to acquire Saunders Island from the estate of WD Benney in the mid-1930s. He also owned property in Stanley.</p><p>While he lived mostly in Argentina, Hamilton was neither a speculator, nor a stereotypical absentee landlord. He took positive action to improve pastures on badly overgrazed Weddell, including stock reductions and replanting of tussac grass, and he imported coniferous seedlings from Punta Arenas for ornamentals and windbreaks. He also attempted to diversify the farm economy through minor industries such as sealing for oil (soon abandoned) and the introduction of exotic mammals such as foxes, skunks and guanacos from the South American continent. The idea was that their pelts, as well as those of South American otters, would find overseas markets. Foxes, of course, have proved a plague to West Falkland farmers and the guanacos never really worked out - though there remains a significant population of them on Staats Island. Introductions of Shetland ponies and Highland cattle, while imaginative, did not long outlast his death.</p><p>Hamilton kept much of his money locally, with more than £90,000 in Stanley's Government Savings Bank even during the Great Depression of the 1930s (when he donated several thousand pounds for the construction of lighthouses on East and West Falkland, and improvements to King Edward VII Memorial Hospital). He also researched road-building in Camp at a time when such projects were so visionary as to be almost hallucinatory.</p><p>In 1940 Hamilton moved to Buenos Aires because of a chronic eye problem and, when ongoing treatment required him to remain nearby, he purchased a stud farm at Merlo, west of the Argentine capital. He died in September 1945, survived by his daughter Penelope Alvarez.</p><p>Unfortunately, Hamilton's Falklands properties became a bone of contention because of their ownership by Hamilton's Argentine heirs. While Hamilton had once attempted to move the headquarters of Hamilton and Saunders from London to Stanley, he ran into complications with Argentina, which may have seen his properties as a foothold in the Falklands. Instead, he incorporated offshore in Jersey. In 1987, five years after the Falklands Conflict, the Hamilton estate finally sold Beaver, Weddell, Saunders and surrounding islets to local residents.</p>",

He qualified as a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland and a Licentiate of the King and Queen's College of Physicians in Ireland. In 1878, he was recommended to the Colonial Office by Sir Arthur Guinness MP. He arrived in Stanley on 14 March 1879.</p><p>Hamilton looked after the health of the colony for 26 years, generally pronouncing it to be excellent with an absence of infectious diseases. Perversely he argued in ExCo in 1897 against the establishment of a cottage hospital as he considered 'the people preferred to remain in their own comfortable homes'. His bluff manner and 'want of reticence' were the despair of female patients who looked with difficulty for an alternative doctor.</p><p>Hamilton was appointed to ExCo in April 1879 and served on the council for 26 years. Excitable, indiscreet, loquacious, he was a difficult colleague and successive governors despaired of him. In May 1889, the eccentric Irish MP MacNeil asked in Parliament about relations between the governor and Hamilton: the junior Colonial Office minister, de Worms, replied that the governor had expressed dissatisfaction with the conduct of the colonial surgeon, especially as a member of ExCo and LegCo, but had not requested his removal.</p><p>When Governor <a href=\"/biographies/kerr_thomas\">KERR</a> in 1890 persuaded the Colonial Office to sell land to the FIC at a very generous rate, Hamilton and <a href=\"/biographies/brandon_lowther\">BRANDON</a> both protested. 'There has been no bound to insinuations against him since Dr Hamilton took up the position he has on the land question', reported Governor <a href=\"/biographies/goldsworthy_sir\">GOLDSWORTHY</a>, who sympathised with him, adding: 'Dr Hamilton is an Irishman, characteristically excitable, not also weighing what he has said in the heat of the argument, but withal an honest man...'</p><p>Although Hamilton complained that he was restricted in serving private patients, Kerr maintained that he had sent home nearly £3000 earned in private practice - a very considerable sum. In 1893 it was noted that he was under the influence of his housekeeper, the wife of the pilot Constable Wilmer. The following year Bradford Wilmer died and eight months later, on 24 April 1905, his widow Caroline and Hamilton were married.</p><p>The Polar explorer Wilson described him cuttingly in 1904: '...looks a terror, by name Hamilton. He is so stout he can hardly walk and he seems a standing joke to everyone. Apparently he has shaken hands with the King [Edward VII] somewhere or another and has never got over it.'</p><p>Hamilton retired in 1905 and returned to live in Dublin, where he died of influenza on 19 September 1917.</p>",

        "body": " <p>sea captain and colonist, was a Dane from the Ditmarches, an area which today is part of northern Germany. Nothing is known about his family background, except that his father is curiously recorded as 'Matz Hanningsen, farmer', on Hansen's marriage certificate. Perhaps Hansen just tried to simplify his own name for English ears. In 1860 he was a crew member of the brig  <em>Concordia </em>of Hamburg, bound to Honolulu with general cargo. Thirty five days out from Río, they encountered heavy seas off Staten Island and in a letter written twenty years later to Sir William <a href=\"/biographies/wiseman_william\">WISEMAN</a>, Hansen described what happened:</p><blockquote><blockquote>The ship fortunately had a light cargo and was very buoyant, but she laboured so heavily that the wind had no power on her, the overfalls rolling over her with violence. With great difficulty we got more sail on her and got her before the wind. After we got out of it, we sounded the pumps and found three feet of water in her and a lot of bulwarks and stanchions gone. We ran for the Falkland Islands and on the second morning after we abandoned the ship at sea, there being seven feet of water in her when we left.</blockquote></blockquote><p>James <a href=\"/biographies/lane_james\">LANE</a>, FIC colonial manager, was also acting consul for Hamburg, and on 16 October 1860 he wrote to Governor <a href=\"/biographies/moore_thomas\">MOORE</a>:</p><blockquote><blockquote>I beg to make known to Your Excy the arrival in the Port of the Captain and 12 hands of the Hamburg Brig Concordia ... the Brig was abandoned and sank within sight of the Captain and men (in the boat) 70 miles SW of Speedwell Island and they reached Stanley, after being 12 days at sea, this morning.</blockquote></blockquote><p>Most of the crew were repatriated, but Charles Hansen decided to stay in the Falklands and Lane gave him employment with the FIC. In 1866 Hansen bought the schooner  <em>Felis  </em>in Montevideo and <em> </em>started trading around the Falklands, working the dangerous shores of the Jason Islands for penguin oil and sealing on the coast of Patagonia. He sailed the  <em>Felis </em>for three years and in 1868 rescued 24 men of a shipwrecked crew and brought them to Stanley. In 1869 he acquired the larger schooner  <em>Louisa, </em>which had belonged to Jacon Napoleon <a href=\"/biographies/goss_jacob\">GOSS</a>. Both boats were registered under the British flag, as Hansen claimed to be from Heligoland (then a British colony). Between 1870 and 1872 he was occupied with salvage work on the English 599-ton barque  <em>Balcarry </em>, wrecked in Tierra del Fuego, and finally managed to re-float the ship and sail her back to Stanley. In 1871 he rescued a number of shipwrecked sailors from a beach in Tierra del Fuego and in September of that year Governor <a href=\"/biographies/darcy_george\">D'ARCY</a> wrote to the Colonial Office describing the difficulties and dangers Hansen had endured in his efforts to locate the crew of yet another wrecked ship, the American barque <em>Italia </em>.</p><blockquote><blockquote>I have detailed this occurrence somewhat at length to prove to Your Lordship what bold and gallant sailors the inhabitants of these Islands are and the personal risks they run on such occasions, leaving no course untried when there is the smallest chance of saving life.</blockquote></blockquote><p>Again in 1873 he sailed in the  <em>Louisa </em>to rescue the crew of the  <em>Neptune </em>of Sunderland, wrecked on Kelp Island.</p><p>On 18 March 1869 at Holy Trinity Church, Stanley, Hansen married Julia Sarah Spittle, who had come to the Falklands with Governor <a href=\"/biographies/robinson_sir\">ROBINSON</a> in 1866, as nurse to his children. The Hansens had five children, Julia Maria (b1869), Fredericka Kate (b1871), Charles (b1873) and twins Jason and Stanley (b1881). In 1872 he took a lease of Carcass Island and all the Jasons and succeeded in clearing Grand Jason of goats which the sealers had left there, replacing them with sheep. He stocked Carcass with sheep and cattle and went to live there with his family in 1875. In 1879 he wrote a long appeal to the governor, confessing that he was in fact Danish and asking for naturalisation as a British citizen. An ordinance granting this was passed by Legislative Council the same year.</p><p>In the late 1870s Hansen bought Lord Dufferin's famous yacht, the <em>Foam </em>, which had served as the government mail schooner between 1864 and 1872. However sadly the boat was lost in 1890 when she went ashore on Carcass Island. Her figurehead is in the Museum in Stanley. Charles Hansen himself was drowned in October 1891, when he fell overboard while taking a sight from the schooner  <em>Result,  </em>on a return voyage from Patagonia.</p><p>Both Grand and Steeple Jason were purchased by Hansen's widow after his death, together with Carcass and she managed the islands until her sons were able to take over. The Jasons were sold to Dean Brothers in 1927, but Jason Hansen and his wife Daisy continued to farm Carcass until Jason died in 1952 when the island was sold to Kitty and Cecil <a href=\"/biographies/bertrand_cecil\">BERTRAND</a> and Adrian MONK.</p><p>There is a memorial window to Charles Hansen in Stanley Cathedral, placed there by his widow in 1899. It shows Christ walking on the water and has the following inscription: 'In affectionate and grateful remembrance of Charles Hansen who was lost at sea thereby entering into the rest that remaineth for the people of God. October 1st 1891. Aged 54'.</p>",

He left much of this on his death to fund retirement homes for seamen in Nøtterøy; these have flourished.

        "body": "<p>farm manager, was born in Doncaster, Yorks on 22 October 1930, the middle one of the seven children of Brook Hardcastle and Ethel, née Hinchcliffe. When he was eight his mother died and he was sent to Silcoates Boarding School in Wakefield where he remained until 1947. His father had a farm at Thixendale near York and Brook Hardcastle was the son who was to study agriculture and eventually take over the farm. Unfortunately his father died and the estate was sold, but he carried on at Riseholme Agricultural College and finished his HND. The family solicitor advised him to look abroad for a job which he did and was finally taken on by JL Waldron at Port Howard as a farm cadet.</p><p>In December 1950 he left England on the <em>Highland Princess </em>and arrived in the Falkland Islands in January 1951, then on to Port Howard by Auster aircraft to start a new life under the watchful eye of Douglas <a href=\"/biographies/pole-evans_douglas\">POLE-EVANS</a> who was the manager. At Port Howard he joined in the farm-life, learning to ride horses, shear sheep, erect fences, keep the farm books and take on any other job going - all the time enjoying the way of life in the Falklands. In 1956 Hardcastle married Eileen Aldridge, an Islander, and they went to the UK on holiday. While there he did courses in welding and the maintenance of farm machinery before returning to the Falklands to work as assistant manager at Port San Carlos.</p><p>After five years at PSC he decided to emigrate to New Zealand with his wife and children - Gavin (b1957), Janet (b1958) and Simon (b1961). Arriving in New Zealand in 1962 he found temporary work with the Department of Lands and Survey dividing up some of the larger farms into viable small holdings for returned servicemen. A year later he applied for the job as stock manager on a farm which was being set up as a training institute for boys of 17-20 years of age. After six months of preparation for students the first intake of eleven were enrolled. Numbers of students increased each year and when Hardcastle returned to the Falklands there were 84 boys attending.</p><p>In 1971 he decided to return to the Islands when offered the post of farms general manager for the Falkland Islands Company, hoping that his New Zealand experience would be of benefit there. After an introductory Landrover trip around the farms on East and West with FIC director Bill (WW) <a href=\"/biographies/blake_william\">BLAKE</a> he finally arrived at Darwin in May of that year. Over the next 20 years he introduced various changes, which included contract shearing, centralising Goose Green milk cows, moving empty shepherd houses to the settlement for occupation and implementing Lord SHACKLETON's 1977 recommendation to divide up some of the larger farms for sale to local people. The first farm subdivided was Green Patch owned by the FIC.</p><p>In 1982 when the invasion by Argentina took place, he was one of the 115 residents held under arrest in the Goose Green Hall. After the Conflict there was much to be sorted out with animal stock disrupted, damage to machinery and fencing and the problem of minefields.</p><p>Hardcastle became the first farms manager of the FIC to assume overall responsibility for Company affairs in the colony, although his principal interests were centred on farming. He was an innovative manager, highly conscious of the need to improve grassland as a prerequisite to increasing sheep numbers. His ideas for improvement were carefully prepared and were supported by the Board of Directors, although not to the full extent that he would have wished, because of the prevailing vicissitudes of the wool market. His views on sheep farming were highly respected both in the colony and outside. He transformed the working conditions of Company employees by considerably reducing the isolation of outside shepherding, bringing houses into the settlement where he fostered much improved social conditions. It had always been traditional for FIC senior managers to be nominated members of Council and it must be regretted that he did not serve as a Councillor at any time, because of his very high standing within the community and the wise counsel which he would have brought to bear.</p><p>Hardcastle retired in 1991, having bought the oldest remaining house in Darwin - he was happy to live among the people he had worked with over the years. He enjoyed fishing, and was a supplier of fish to Stanley. Other hobbies included gardening, carving horn and, having a 'feel' for wool, he enjoyed spinning whilst listening to the radio. He led an active life until a month before he died in Stanley on 17 July 2003.</p>",

His father was for many years the Stanley manager of the Falkland Islands Company. Harding was educated in England, and after his return to the Falklands in 1911 he began his farming life as a cadet at San Carlos. A year later he moved to Port Howard on West Falkland where he spent four years as a cadet under the then manager, RC <a href=\"/biographies/pole-evans_reginald\">POLE-EVANS</a>.</p><p>In June 1916 Harding left the Islands to fight in World War I. Many of his contemporaries were already serving, some had been wounded, some had died. He joined the 77th Brigade of the Heavy Artillery Group and served in France for the rest of the war as a gunnery officer, attaining the rank of captain. News of Harding's 'wonderful escape from death' was printed in the <em>Falkland Islands Magazine </em>in October 1917. Together with four other gunner officers, he was in an observation post near Armentières when a shell burst, killing two and wounding another of his fellow officers. He spent some time in hospital in 1918 suffering from shellshock, and for the rest of his life was subject to appalling nightmares.</p><p>Harding's father had retired to England in 1917.

They lived at North Arm until 1932 when they returned to West Falkland where Harding became manager for Holmested Blake and Company at Hill Cove. He was respected by all who knew and worked for him during his many years at Hill Cove. On retirement in 1953 he and his wife moved to Stanley.</p><p>Harding spent many years in unofficial service to the Falkland Islands Government. He was appointed to LegCo from 1919 to 1923, and again from 1956 to 1960. In 1936 he was made a Justice of the Peace. He was appointed to ExCo in 1953 where he served until his death in 1965. He was awarded the OBE in 1958 for honourable public service. During World War II he was in charge of the Defence Force on West Falkland, resuming his rank of captain for the duration, according to surviving telegrams of the period. In addition to government service on both Councils he was, after retirement, joint chairman of the Sheepowners' Association. He also served as a director to several farming companies.</p><p>Harding died in 1965. He was a quietly spoken man with a reserved manner, but family and close friends knew the serious minded appearance hid a tremendous sense of humour. Having no children of his own he took great interest in his beloved nieces and nephew, and they returned his affection, knowing him to be a kind and compassionate man, and a true friend to them. His obituary, written by a contemporary, includes the remark: 'Probably his most marked character was his complete and utter integrity - the very soul of honesty'.</p><p><a href=\"/biographies/bonner_john1\">See Image 50</a></p>",

Following his return to England in 1892 he was recruited by the Falkland Islands Company and returned to the Islands later that year, becoming a most able second in command to the then colonial manager, AE Baillon, whom he succeeded in 1898. Harding married Augusta Amy Oxborrow in the islands and they had two children, both born in the Islands: Hugh Cullen <a href=\"/biographies/harding_hugh\">HARDING</a> (b1893) and a daughter Dorothy Ruth (b1895) who sadly died of meningitis in 1901.</p><p>Harding's colonial service background did much to heal the rift which had developed between the company and the government, but his most important contribution was in establishing a rapport with the independent farmers, perhaps influenced initially by his success in persuading the governor to drop his plans to introduce a graduated land tax. However it was Harding's personal qualities which made him a successful colonial manager over two periods, 1898-1916 and 1919-1922. A man of great intelligence, shrewd and level-headed in business matters, he had a keen sense of humour and was a delightful companion, always ready to help and advise. His early years as colonial manager were marked by an upsurge in the ship repair business and the assumption of the shipping agency for the Pacific Steam Navigation Company, which was appointed to run the mail contract in 1900. He faced difficulty in securing backing for his ideas in shipping and retailing because FE <a href=\"/biographies/cobb_frederick\">COBB</a>, the managing director in London, proved as obdurate as his predecessors in the head office. However the Company turned to steam for its inter-island service and established a mutton-canning factory at Darwin in 1911 which proved highly successful during World War I. Harding, who did not enjoy the best of health, faced a challenging time early in the war when, in November 1914 following the Battle of Coronel, the colony faced an imminent attack from von <a href=\"/biographies/spee_maximilian\">SPEE</a>'s powerful naval squadron. Harding organised the evacuation of people, stores, cash and records on SS <em>Falkland </em>to Darwin and dispersed the Company's small craft around the colony.</p><p>Harding's qualities and popularity were such that he made a major contribution to community affairs. He was appointed an unofficial member of the LegCo in 1899 and served until his retirement to England in 1917. He was also a nominated member of ExCo from 1915 to 1917. He returned to the colony in 1919 at the request of the Company resuming the colonial managership during the difficult post-war years and was again nominated to ExCo until his final retirement in 1922.</p><p>During the war years Harding corresponded with WM Dean over the latter's <em>History of the Falkland Islands Company  </em>(which is still unpublished).

        "body": "<p> biologist, was born in Nottingham on 10 February 1896, the youngest of the three sons of Richard Hardy, architect and his wife Elizabeth Hannah Clavering. After school at Oundle, he went to Exeter College Oxford in 1914. He married Silvia Lucy Garstang, the second daughter of Walter Garstang, professor of Zoology at Leeds. They had two children Michael and Belinda. Hardy's studies in Oxford were interrupted by war service, firstly in the northern cyclist battalion and later as a camouflage officer. In 1919 he returned to Oxford to read zoology and in 1921 he became an assistant naturalist at the Fisheries Laboratory, Lowestoft, researching the feeding of North Sea herrings on plankton.</p><p>After applying to the Discovery Committee for the post of director of science he was appointed senior ship zoologist, in early 1924. He spent the summer preparing in the London office and sailed south on the <em>Discovery </em>with Stanley <a href=\"/biographies/kemp_stanley\">KEMP</a> as Director and Rolfe <a href=\"/biographies/gunther_eustace\">GUNTHER</a> as his junior. Throughout their voyage he worked at developing a plankton recorder, which after further development is now a standard piece of equipment. In and out of South Georgia from 20 February until 17 April 1926, he was engaged in trawling along lines at different depths to investigate what plankton, including krill, they could find and attempting to relate their finds to whaling areas. On land he greatly enjoyed walking and collecting specimens of anything he saw, but spent much time stopping for research. He visited the Falklands from 24 April to 20 May and while there Captain <a href=\"/biographies/roberts_david\">ROBERTS</a> lent the gunboat <em>Afterglow </em>to take the biologists to investigate fauna growing on the side of the SS <em>Great Britain.  </em>On returning to South Georgia after wintering in South Africa he transferred to the <em>William Scoresby, </em>the Discovery Committee's second ship, and immediately began a series of trawling surveys on lines at right angles to the coast. In early February 1927 he sailed on <em>Discovery </em>to the South Orkneys and South Shetlands before returning to Stanley, transferring to the <em>Scoresby </em>and sailing by an indirect route back to Falmouth the following September. This expedition laid the foundation for all Hardy's future work and in January 1928 he was appointed the first professor of zoology at the new University College, Hull. The intervening months were spent planning the new department while working for the Committee so it was not until Volume XI of the <em>Discovery Reports </em>in 1936 that the hard work done on the <em>Discovery </em>was published. After Stanley Kemp's death he served on the Discovery Scientific Sub-Committee from December 1945 - March 1949. He became Regius Professor of natural history at Aberdeen in 1942 and rapidly moved on to Oxford as Linacre Professor of zoology from 1945-1961, continuing as professor of field studies until 1963.</p><p>Hardy was a man with great biological curiosity and many ideas who delighted in thinking up hypotheses and hoping that science would prove them correct. Seeing Gunther up a mast finding insects 'flying past' many miles from shore, he considered aerial plankton and in 1960 one of his talks gave rise to the aquatic ape theory. In 1969 he founded and became director of a Religious Experience Research Centre now based in Lampeter College, Wales.</p><p>His many interests included flying, ballooning, walking, cycling and painting water colours. He wrote easily. Eighty publications written either in his own name or jointly with others covered plankton, fish, aerial drift of insects, ballooning and in later life much on the possible relationship between natural history and religion. <em>Great Waters  </em>(Collins 1967) is a description and update of the work done in 1925-27. His honours included a DSc from Oxford in 1938, later receiving honorary degrees from Southampton, Hull and Aberdeen. He was elected FRS in 1940 and awarded a knighthood in 1957. He died after a stroke on 23 May 1985.</p>",

        "body": "<p>business man and councillor, was born in Stanley on 15 February 1898, the eldest son of Arthur Hardy, baker, and his wife Mary (Min), née Brown. The family ran Stanley Bakery, in the stone building at 44 John Street and Les was educated at the Government School. In 1922 he married Edith Isabella Pearce, the daughter of John Pearce, keeper at Cape Pembroke Lighthouse. They had one son, Jack Arthur (Tony) born in 1926.</p><p>Les Hardy was probably the most successful local business entrepreneur of his time. He lived at and owned Montague House, 40 John Street. In the front of his premises he operated a very up-market retail outlet, the Kelper Store, where he sold fancy goods, fashion jewellery, confectionery, ice cream, toys, magazines and periodicals. He was also agent for Philips and Hoover electrical appliances and Hillman cars and trucks. In the back room on Villiers Street he had a cinema which screened silent films and then moved to the Gymnasium in 1938 when 'talkies' were introduced for the first time. This cinema transferred to the Town Hall in 1953. To the rear of the Kelper Store was his Pioneer Mineral Water Factory, producing all the soft drink requirements of the day: tonic water, soda water, lemonade, fruit flavoured cordials and so on. It could be said that World War II contributed hugely to his already thriving business when 1,700 troops were garrisoned in Stanley, calling for unprecedented volumes of mineral water products, but his hard work and dedication were the secret of his success. He was very competitive and frequently could be observed visiting competitors' shops, comparing prices and adjusting his own accordingly. In 1947 he bought Stanley Cottage on Ross Road and established Stanley Cottage Tea Rooms and a retail outlet for ladies fashion attire, ice cream and confectionery.</p><p>All his life Les Hardy was active in community affairs. He was a leader of the Islands Scout movement during the 1930s and a great supporter of local charities. He served on many government boards and various committees, including Stanley Sports Association.At one time he was superintendent of Stanley Voluntary Fire Brigade. Both he and his wife were pillars of the Cathedral. He was made a JP in 1946 and in the same year was awarded the British Empire Medal. In 1948 he became the first chairman of the newly-formed Stanley Town Council. In 1949 he was elected to LegCo, becoming senior elected member in 1952. In 1960 he was awarded an OBE in the Queen's Birthday Honours and was still a serving member of LegCo at the time of his death on 6 February 1962.</p><p>Hardy was a very active figure, who found it difficult to sit still and relax. He always smoked a pipe and was teetotal, never having drunk alcohol in his life. A man of cheerful and sober disposition, he had a great sense of humour. In paying tribute to Les Hardy at a Council meeting on the day of his death, Governor Sir Edwin <a href=\"/biographies/arrowsmith_sir\">ARROWSMITH</a>, having mentioned 'his distinguished record of public service'. added 'I shall always remember his love for children and flowers and the happy twinkle that was never long absent from his eye ... but I think what I shall remember best of all was his pride in being a Falkland Islander'.</p>",

        "body": "<p>biologist, was born in Norwich on 8 March 1892, the second of the five children of Frederic William Harmer, a wool merchant, and his wife Mary Young, née Lyon. He attended a day school in Norwich before being sent to Amersham Hall, Reading. In 1879 he won a mathematics scholarship to University College London, getting his BSc in natural sciences two years later. On seeing King's College Cambridge by moonlight, he decided to go there, won an open scholarship in 1881 and gained first class honours in natural science.</p><p>He remained at Cambridge as an academic biologist until 1908. During that time he obtained experience in marine biology at Roscoff in Brittany, Naples and Plymouth and became superintendent of the University Museum of Zoology in 1892. Later that year he was invited to inspect and record a stranded Sowerby's Beaked Whale ( <em>Mesoplodon bidens </em>) at Overstrand, Norfolk. He was awarded his doctorate in 1897 and elected FRS in 1898. He was vice-president of the Royal Society from 1922-24, and was president of the Linnean Society from 1927-31. He coedited the ten volumes of the Cambridge Natural History (1895-1909). Appointed keeper of zoology at the British Museum (Natural History in 1909, he became responsible for one of the largest existing collections of Cetacea (marine mammals) in the world. He became Director of the Natural History Museum in 1919 and was awarded the KBE in 1920. He published 112 articles of which 36 related to whales and whaling and initiated the recording at the Natural History Museum of all stranded whales in the UK.</p><p>Although Harmer never visited the Falklands or South Georgia he had an enormous influence on the work of the Discovery Committee. In 1910 he was approached by Jens Andreas Mørch, a Norwegian whaling engineer newly returned from the South Shetlands, who worried that 'hump back whales were of little concern to the scientific world from a biological point of view, considering their present commercial importance.' Mørch suggested that all details of whales killed should be scientifically recorded in order to estimate whether 'over fishing' was occurring, adding that this could be funded by an increase in the licence fees for whaling.</p><p>Harmer sent a copy of the letter to ER Darnley, then secretary to the finance committee at the Colonial Office, and a series of committees followed acting on Harmer's advice. The most important was the Interdepartmental Committee on Research and Development in the Dependencies of the Falkland Islands, which published its report in 1920. Its recommendations led to the scientific investigations overseen by the Discovery Committee. Harmer was vice-chairman of the Discovery Committee for eighteen years (1923-1941) and Chairman of the Scientific Sub-Committee. He was particularly connected with the appointment of Stanley Wells <a href=\"/biographies/kemp_stanley\">KEMP</a> as scientific director, the programme for marking whales to establish their migration routes and age, and the establishment of the laboratories at the Natural History Museum in London where scientists worked on the data that had been collected at sea and in South Georgia.</p><p>A reputation for diplomacy - 'no-one could possibly quarrel with Harmer' - was tested in 1928 when the FIC manager Gresham wrote to Governor <a href=\"/biographies/hodson_sir\">HODSON</a> complaining that the Discovery Committee's activities were a gross waste of money. Hodson sent a 29 page dispatch in intemperate language to the secretary of state Leo Amery, magnifying the complaints against the committee and its employees (some of whom having returned from sea, under very bad conditions, had been drunk on the streets of Stanley) and inveighing against everything that they had ever done. Feathers were considerably ruffled in London and Harmer was involved in drafting a suitable scientific and squashing reply.</p><p>Harmer was a detailed and fastidious record keeper, both as a taxonomist and as a committee man. His Discovery Committee papers allow a marvellous insight into the workings of the organisation. He married Laura Russell Howell in 1891 and had four children. He died in Cambridge on 22 October 1950.</p>",

        "body": " <p>admiral, was born in London on 19 January 1888, the son of a barrister, Surtees Harwood Harwood and his wife Mary Cecilia, née Ullathorne. He became a naval cadet in the <em>Britannia </em>in 1903 and in his examinations for lieutenant received first class certificates in all subjects. He specialised in torpedo warfare and served as torpedo officer in a number of ships, although without seeing action, in World War I. After the war, Harwood served in the South American squadron for two years, learning Spanish and becoming acquainted with the countries and people of Latin America. His later postings were largely on the staff, although he was fleet torpedo officer in the Mediterranean. He married Joan Chard in 1924; they had two sons, both of whom entered the navy. In 1928 he was promoted captain.</p><p>In 1936 Harwood was appointed commodore in charge of the South American division of the America and West Indian station. After the outbreak of war in September 1939 it was learnt that the German pocket battleship <em>Admiral Graf Spee,  </em>Captain Langsdorff, was operating in the South Atlantic. She was larger and more powerful than any of Harwood's command and she had sunk nine ships before her engines began to malfunction. Harwood correctly anticipated that the <em>Graf Spee </em>would try to attack a convoy off the River Plate and lay in wait for her with two light cruisers, <em>Ajax  </em>and <em>Achilles </em>and the larger <em>Exeter,  </em>Captain <a href=\"/biographies/bell_frederick\">BELL</a>. Battle was joined on 13 December: as his ships were out-gunned by the Germans, Harwood attacked the <em>Graf Spee </em>from two directions, but <em>Exeter </em>was damaged and had to sail for Stanley, while the two other ships disengaged after being hit. The <em>Graf Spee  </em>took shelter in neutral Montevideo but was obliged to move on and, convinced that larger British warships were waiting for him, Langsdorff scuttled his ship and committed suicide on 17 December.</p><p>Harwood's success was a welcome boost to British morale: he was promoted rear-admiral and knighted by radio (to KCB). His fleet, joined by <em>Cumberland </em>, regrouped in Stanley, the wounded were treated in KEMH and an impressive funeral service was held for the dead in the Cathedral on 18 December. In May 1940 Harwood presented gifts (powder compacts with the crest of HMS <em>Exeter </em>) to a number of ladies in Stanley who had helped to nurse the wounded 'with grateful thanks for their devoted service' in a ceremony at the Town Hall.</p><p>Harwood returned home to a staff post late in 1940 and was appointed commander-in-chief Mediterranean in 1942. It was not a successful posting and he was moved to a less demanding one before being invalided out of the navy in 1945 in the rank of admiral. He died at home in Oxfordshire on 9 June 1950.</p><p>Harwood was a keen sportsman and a person of natural charm who enjoyed much goodwill in Latin America thanks to his knowledge of Spanish. Streets were named after him in Uruguay and on his death requiem masses were said for him in Montevideo and Buenos Aires.</p>",

        "body": "<p>governor, was born on 25 November 1916 in Dublin, the son of John McDougall Haskard, a British army officer and his wife Alicia, née Hutchins, whose family had been landowners in Co Cork. His earliest years were spent in Ireland and England and in 1923 he went with his father to Egypt and two years later to China. In 1928 he was sent back to England to prep school from where he went on to Cheltenham. In 1931 his father, Brigadier-General Haskard, retired and settled near Bantry in Co Cork. Haskard went on to Sandhurst and passed out in second place at the end of the course. However, a chest infection caused him to fail his medical which led to a change in career prospects. In 1937 he entered Pembroke College, Cambridge, to read modern languages with colonial service in mind.</p><p><strong>War and Africa</strong></p><p>War with Germany becoming increasingly likely, Haskard received a Territorial Army commission at Cambridge and when war broke out he joined the Royal Irish Fusiliers. His application to join the Colonial Service was approved in 1940 and he was posted to Tanganyika {Tanzania}, to be seconded to a Tanganyika battalion of the King's African Rifles (KAR), but a recurrence of his chest infection resulted in a long delay before he was fit to join the 13th KAR and then the 2nd KAR, both of which were Nyasaland battalions. Haskard served in Ceylon {Sri Lanka} and in 1944 in Burma, being awarded the MBE He was demobilised in 1946 with the wartime rank of major.</p><p>After his service with Nyasaland troops a transfer from the Tanganyika service to that of the Nyasaland Protectorate {Malawi} was approved and in 1946 Haskard began 18 years of close involvement with that country. Much of his first ten years was spent in district and provincial administration, for which he had a particular liking. The era of travelling on foot in rural areas had not yet passed and Haskard came to acquire a fair knowledge of several districts and, particularly in the Northern Province, he was able to establish a friendly relationship with many leading Africans. He was seconded for a time to the Anglo-Portuguese Boundary Commission, being in charge of fieldwork on the Nyasaland-Mozambique border and twice attending negotiations in Lisbon. In the 1950s the advent of the short-lived Central African Federation, linking Nyasaland more closely to Southern and Northern Rhodesia, gradually brought about an unwelcome deterioration in the previously peaceful relationship between the Africans of Nyasaland and the Protectorate government.</p><p>For Haskard one personal event of significance was his marriage in 1957 to Phillada Stanley, at that time working in the secret registry of the secretariat in Zomba. Her father, Sir Robert Stanley, had served in no less than seven colonial territories usually accompanied by his wife and daughter. Phillada Stanley was therefore no stranger to colonial life overseas.</p><p>In 1959 the deteriorating political situation in Nyasaland led to the declaration of a state of emergency. Haskard was the provincial commissioner in charge of the Northern Province, the area of greatest unrest, and found himself having to suppress by military force the insurrection of those with whose anti-federation views he had some sympathy. After the troubles, a commission of enquiry, the Devlin Commission, produced a report largely critical of the Protectorate Government but somewhat less censorious of events in the Northern Province. Haskard attributed this in part to the fact that, following army practice, a precise occurrence diary had been kept throughout the three months of the emergency. The diary had been the responsibility of his wife, a volunteer at Northern Province headquarters. In the 1960 New Year Honours Haskard was appointed CMG.</p><p>Nyasaland was granted self-government in 1961, two years after the emergency, with Dr Hastings Kamuzu Banda as Chief Minister. Haskard along with other senior expatriate officers became a permanent secretary under an African minister. In the Ministry of Natural Resources he worked directly under Dr Banda himself, an interesting experience. During this period Haskard suffered a recurrence of the same chest complaint which had seriously affected him as a young man. Fortunately on this occasion a Harley Street physician diagnosed the trouble and thanks to a skilful surgeon a full recovery was made.</p><p><strong>Governor of the Falkland Islands</strong></p><p>In 1964 Haskard was appointed governor of the Falkland Islands and high commissioner for the British Antarctic Territory. He travelled out by sea accompanied by his wife and their son Julian (b1962). It was during this voyage that Haskard learnt of renewed Argentine interest in the Islands and the exploit of the Argentine aviator <a href=\"/biographies/fitzgerald_miguel\">FITZGERALD</a> landing on Stanley racecourse.</p><p>The Haskards found the Falklands a place very much to their liking. The austere beauty of the Islands had much in common with the exposed coast of south-west Ireland; the somewhat conservative way of life was agreeable; the friendliness of the people was reassuring to newcomers. Being accustomed to life in out of the way places, they did not see the absence of an external air service and an overseas telephone link as a disadvantage. Haskard was fortunate in finding WH <a href=\"/biographies/thompson_willoughby\">THOMPSON</a>, the colonial secretary, a kindred spirit who shared many of his views but who did not hesitate to speak his mind effectively when need arose. Haskard was no great innovator: indeed even if he had been, the situation he found in the Falklands did not lend itself to any remarkable change. Wool was still the only substantial source of revenue and, year on year, wool prices were declining. The population was itself in decline and the long-term future of the colony was uncertain.</p><p>The Fitzgerald incident reawakened some awareness to the threat from Argentina. Haskard recommended that the platoon of Royal Marines carried by the guardship HMS <em>Protector </em>should remain in the Islands when <em>Protector </em>returned north at the end of the southern summer and this was agreed. In the 1965 New Year Honours, Haskard received a knighthood, the KCMG.</p><p>The Haskards tried to get to know, however superficially, as much of the Islands and as many Islanders as possible; almost all farms in the Camp were visited, sometimes by Beaver float plane, sometimes on horseback; the annual horticultural show was revived and a winter show for arts and crafts was started; an annual trip to South Georgia was made and all Antarctic bases except Halley Bay were visited. Government House, where three dances were held each year, was a focus for social gatherings, anyone who cared to sign the book being invited to attend a social function of one kind or other.</p><p><strong>Argentine Pressure and British Reactions</strong></p><p>A feature of Falkland Islands life was to listen regularly to the BBC World Service which was generally regarded as the mouthpiece of the British Government. On 23 July 1966 listeners were given an unwelcome shock by a surprising broadcast from London of a talk by a member of the Bank of London and South America which seemed to advocate a transfer of sovereignty to Argentina. That such a broadcast should come from London rather than Buenos Aires was the first public indication that the British Government were inclined to appease Argentina. ExCo met the day after the broadcast and Haskard telegraphed to the Commonwealth Office the emphatic view of members that Falkland Islanders had no desire to be handed over to Argentina and that the population wished to retain the closest possible ties with Britain.</p><p>From this time onwards the Argentine question became an increasing preoccupation for Haskard. He was the last governor to be appointed under the Colonial Office before it merged with the Commonwealth Office and in both these ministries and in the Foreign Office knowledge about the Falkland Islands was scanty. Public opinion in the Islands lacked political expression and Haskard found himself increasingly engaged in personally conveying to officials in Whitehall what he perceived to be the facts of Islands opinion. In September 1966 he went to London for talks at the Foreign Office about the Anglo-Argentine dispute. Thompson was on leave and the officer administering the government in the Falkland Islands was Leslie <a href=\"/biographies/gleadell_leslie\">GLEADELL</a>, the colonial treasurer. On 28 September an Argentine Aerolineas DC 4 was hijacked by a group of young Argentine nationalists calling themselves <a href=\"/biographies/condor_group\">CONDOR</a> and made a landing on Stanley racecourse, there being no airfield. Gleadell, a Falkland Islander, acquitted himself creditably in handling a tricky situation, which ended with the enforced but peaceful repatriation of the hijackers to Argentina.</p><p>The Condor incident brought the Falkland Islands briefly to public notice in the United Kingdom. Over the next eighteen months a series of consultations took place in Whitehall involving British officials, the Foreign Secretary George <a href=\"/biographies/brown_george\">BROWN</a>, and the Argentine Ambassador. On two occasions in New York Brown met the Argentine Minister for Foreign Affairs, Costa Mendez. The assumption appeared to be that ultimately the Islands would be handed over to Argentina: the problem was to find a solution acceptable to British public opinion which would secure adequate guarantees for the Islanders but be politically acceptable to the Argentine Government. Discussion centred on how long a period would be needed before Falkland Islands opinion could be brought round to accept a change of sovereignty. The draft outline of a treaty with Argentina was considered: it included a proviso that any change in sovereignty should be acceptable to the Islanders. Subsequently, thought was given to omission of this proviso and substituting a memorandum of understanding attached to the draft treaty explaining that HMG could not transfer sovereignty unless this was acceptable to the people. This memorandum would not be part of the treaty.</p><p>Haskard was kept informed of much of what was discussed and he was permitted to take members of ExCo into his confidence to some degree. When on home leave in 1967 he attended meetings at the Commonwealth Office. It was after his return to the Islands in September 1967 that he began to be seriously concerned that HMG was sliding into a position which could have dire consequences for the Islanders. From October to December he addressed a series of letters and telegrams to the Commonwealth Office emphasising Islanders' ignorance of the negotiations, their lack of knowledge of and aversion to Argentina, their very English outlook. He urged delay in negotiations so that Islanders should have time to get accustomed to the possibility of change, pointing out that they were in no way prepared for a statement on the lines envisaged in the draft treaty and memorandum of understanding.</p><p>Officials in the Commonwealth Office and the Foreign Office were not inclined to give much weight to Haskard's representations. They felt that while his letters were not encouraging, too much importance should not be attached to them. Haskard was well aware that his opinions were not well received in Whitehall and in January 1968 he requested permission to come to London to present his views personally. This was agreed and he took passage to Montevideo in HMS <em>Protector </em>. A fellow passenger was DM Summerhayes, counsellor at the British Embassy in Buenos Aires, who had just visited the Islands and in a report concluded that the tendency in the Islands would be to postpone for as long as possible any hand-over to Argentine rule, while the Argentines would be eager for a quick transfer. Summerhayes considered the gap between the two attitudes virtually unbridgeable.</p><p>In London Haskard had a series of discussions at the Commonwealth Office and the Foreign Office leading up to a difficult meeting with George Brown on 14 February. The following day Brown asked that Haskard should see him again and made amends for some angry remarks he had made at their first meeting. That evening Haskard left by air for Santiago and on to Punta Arenas where the colony vessel MV <em>Forrest </em>awaited him.</p><p>Haskard was uncertain whether his London visit would have had any real impact but, unknown to him, his views had been supported from an unexpected quarter. The Ambassador in Buenos Aires, Sir Michael Creswell, having read the Summerhayes report, had telegraphed on 9 February that signing the memorandum of understanding when the Islanders were unprepared to accept its long term implications could lead to friction with Argentina rather than cooperation. In a letter the Ambassador added that his sympathies were really on the side of the Islanders and that he was very much aware of the arguments which had been put forcefully by Haskard.</p><p>Back in Stanley on 20 February, Haskard gave ExCo an account of his visit. The Commonwealth Office had instructed him to tell members in confidence of the latest version of the memorandum of understanding and the Argentine alternative wording. But as far as the public was concerned, he was to avoid reference to issues still remaining undecided in London and to the Gibraltar dispute. ExCo met again on the next two days and discussed a draft, which Haskard had prepared, for a public announcement. Members appreciated his personal position but did not like the noncommittal tone of the draft any more than Haskard did himself. The broadcast was made on the evening of 22 February and, as expected, was the subject of adverse comment. The unofficial members of ExCo presented Haskard with a declaration of their dismay that so little attention was being paid to the wishes of the Islanders and of their concern that the British Government proposed sooner or later to act against those wishes. Haskard transmitted this statement to the Commonwealth Office on 24 February.</p><p>The initiative now passed to the unofficial members of ExCo, AG <a href=\"/biographies/barton_arthur\">BARTON</a>, RV Goss, Sydney <a href=\"/biographies/miller_sydney\">MILLER</a> and Christopher <a href=\"/biographies/bonner_george\">BONNER</a>, who on 27 February published a statement sounding the alarm. This was addressed to each member of the British Parliament and to a number of British newspapers. Despite this development, Foreign Office policy remained set to continue the search for a formula which would take sufficient account of Islanders' wishes but would be sufficiently flexible in interpretation to enable agreement with the Argentine Foreign Minister, on the basis that it could be presented to public opinion in the United Kingdom and in the Falklands in one way and to public opinion in Argentina in another. However, the ExCo initiative put such a policy under public scrutiny in Parliament and the British press. A <em>Daily Express </em>reporter named Comben spent a fortnight in the Islands during April and May. His visit led on 2 October 1968 to an Express photographer Matthews taking a well publicised photograph of a large crowd at the whalebone arch in Stanley proclaiming their loyalty to Great Britain.</p><p><strong>Lord Chalfont's Visit </strong></p><p>On 17 October 1968 the Commonwealth Relations Office was merged with the Foreign Office, always the senior partner. In November the long awaited visit of a government minister to the Islands took place. Lord <a href=\"/biographies/chalfont_alun\">CHALFONT</a>, on his arrival, was greeted by public demonstrations on the theme of 'Keep the Falklands British'. Chalfont used his considerable negotiating skill in an attempt to persuade Councillors and the public that it was in their long term interest to come to an accommodation with Argentina. He explained in detail to council members the proposed contents of a memorandum of understanding with the Argentine Government and also of a unilateral statement which could be made in Parliament stressing that sovereignty would not be ceded without Islanders' consent. However, Chalfont failed to reassure his audiences. A reminder of Argentine interest in the Islands during Chalfont's visit was the crash landing of a light aircraft, again flown by Fitzgerald, on the Eliza Cove road.</p><p>Chalfont's visit left the Islanders uncertain as to what might happen next but the Argentine Government's opposition to the proposed unilateral statement led to failure by the two Governments to agree on sovereignty. On 11 December 1968 the Foreign Secretary, Michael <a href=\"/biographies/stewart_robert\">STEWART</a>, who had succeeded George Brown, gave an explicit assurance that HMG would not transfer sovereignty against the wishes of the Falkland Islanders. This statement brought about a much more relaxed attitude within the Islands towards relations with the mainland and meant that contact between HMG and Argentina would henceforth be closely monitored.</p><p>Haskard's five year governorship was due to end in September 1969 but in February of that year the unofficial members of Executive and Legislative Councils addressed a request to the secretary of state that Haskard's term of office should be extended. Thompson, the colonial secretary, was due to end his service in May and in view of the political situation it was felt important that there should be a reasonable degree of continuity. Councillors maintained that the Haskards made an excellent team. An extension of a year was approved.</p><p><strong>Development and the SS Great Britain. </strong></p><p>While reaction to the Argentine claim was Haskard's major preoccupation, throughout his time in the Islands he made a determined effort to encourage the improvement of pastures as a contribution to the prosperity of the sheep farming industry. In this he was supported by forward looking farmers who had already been taking steps in this direction. A grasslands officer had been on the government staff since 1965 but his recommendations lacked the stamp of authority. However in 1967 the Islands were fortunate in having a five-week visit from CW <a href=\"/biographies/guillebaud_claude\">GUILLEBAUD</a>, emeritus university reader in economics at Cambridge. Guillebaud's wide-ranging report on the economy resulted in the rate of profits tax being raised from 2 shillings in the pound to 4 shillings. This increase was linked to an investment allowance which enabled capital investment for pasture improvement to be set off against the additional tax. This was a spur to investment although the depressed state of world wool prices limited the amount of capital available to the sheep farming companies.</p><p>In September 1969 Haskard was able to welcome an advisory team of five professionals sponsored by the Ministry of Overseas Development who came to study all aspects of sheep and cattle health and production. The team, led by TH <a href=\"/biographies/davies_william\">DAVIES</a>, a grassland agronomist, spent seven months in the Islands, established most friendly relations with the whole farming community and produced a practical report, many recommendations of which were implemented.</p><p>In 1970 the Falkland Islands received some satisfactory publicity in the United Kingdom when Brunel's famous ship the <em>Great Britain, </em>which had been decaying in Stanley harbour and at Sparrow Cove for the previous 84 years, was returned to the port of Bristol where she had been built. Public opinion in the Falklands preferred that the ship should remain a landmark where she lay but the imaginative idea that she should be transported across the Atlantic on a pontoon was sufficiently well received for Haskard to recommend to the secretary of state that the <em>Great Britain </em>, a crown wreck, should be repatriated.</p><p>In September 1970 the Haskard family left the Falkland Islands on final departure with their son Julian, who had been a pupil at Stanley Junior School. They travelled through South America homeward bound. British Ambassadors along their way were particularly hospitable but Haskard was fully aware that further government employment was unlikely to come his way. After a short spell in England, the Haskards retired to enjoy an active country life in Ireland. They continued to keep in close touch with Falkland Islanders and in 1977, on the initiative of W Hunter <a href=\"/biographies/christie_eric\">CHRISTIE</a>, Haskard was invited to become a vice-president of the Falkland Islands Association.</p><p>When the Argentines invaded the Falklands in 1982 the Foreign and Commonwealth Office was unresponsive to Haskard's offer of help but the Haskards were able to provide detailed information and photographs to the SAS and to the 7th Gurkhas. Their son Julian, just commissioned into the 2nd Gurkhas, played a part in this.</p><p>In 2004 the Falkland Islands Government approved the name Haskard Rise for a new housing development west of Government House.</p><p><a href=\"/biographies/chalfont_alun\">See Image 80</a><br><a href=\"?q=node/327\">See Image 236</a></p>",

In 1854 the family moved abroad and Thelton Hall was sold. Thomas Havers became manager of the Falkland Islands Company in Stanley from 1854 to 1861 and honorary consul for Hamburg. He subsequently worked in Montevideo, Uruguay where he started the <em>Montevideo Times  </em>and became director of public works. Little is known of Alice Havers' childhood in Stanley and Montevideo. The death of her mother in Stanley must have been a serious loss. Her religious upbringing was presumably Catholic as her father is known to have held Catholic services and given religious instruction in   Stanley; he appealed to Cardinal Wiseman, Archbishop of Westminster, for a priest to be sent to the Falklands. It is also probable that her father - who planned a series of paintings of Falklands fauna - encouraged her interest in art.</p><p>After the death of Thomas Havers in 1870, the family returned to England and Alice Havers was granted a free studentship at the South Kensington art schools in London. On 13 April 1872 she married the artist Frederick Morgan (1847/8-1927) with whom she later had two children, Lilian and Reginald - and in the same year began exhibiting her work. Only one known painting, <em>A Montevidean Carnival  </em>(exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1874) refers directly to her childhood experience. However the latter may well have informed her interest in themes connected with rural life and work and perhaps contributed also towards her strong social conscience. This is manifest in ambitious paintings such as <em>'Tis a very good world we live in </em>(1874), which contrasts the lot of rich and poor, <em>The end of her journey  </em>(exhibited Royal Academy 1877; Rochdale Art Gallery), <em>Trouble  </em>(exhibited Royal Academy 1882) and <em>The Rights of the Poor  </em>(exhibited Institute of Painters in Oil Colours 1883/4). Havers exhibited widely and works in public collections include <em>They homeward wend their weary way  </em>(1876; National Museum of Wales, Cardiff), <em>Blanchisseuses  </em>(1880; Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool), <em>Rush-cutters  </em>(Mappin Art Gallery, Sheffield) and <em>The belle of the village  </em>(Atkinson Art Gallery, Southport). Havers was a popular artist, partly as a result of early recognition by Queen Victoria who bought <em>'Ought and carry one'  </em>(Royal Academy 1874), a painting which was subsequently engraved. <em>A Montevidean Carnival  </em>was commissioned by the collector Henry Blackburn. <em>'But Mary kept all these things and pondered them in her heart'  </em>(Castle Museum, Norwich) received an honourable mention at the Paris Salon in 1889. Her paintings were priced up to £250. Havers was also an illustrator - of stories by her sister, Theodora/Dorothy <a href=\"/biographies/havers_dorothy\">HAVERS</a> (1847-1923), who published under the pseudonym Theo Gift, and of collections of poetry.</p><p>In 1888 - by which time she had separated from her husband - Havers studied under the artist Filippo Colarossi in Paris. She took her own life on 26 August 1890 at 11 Marlborough Road, London.</p>",

The family moved to Montevideo in 1861, where her father died in 1870, whereupon the family returned to England. Dorothy Havers began to write stories for magazines and published her first novel in 1874.

As she wrote under the name of Theo Gift, some reviewers believed she was a man.  <em>Maid Ellice </em>, which she wrote in 1878, is semi-autobiographical, about an orphaned girl from Montevideo moving to England and the contrast with her upbringing in Uruguay.</p><p>On 22 April 1879 she married George Simonds Boulger, an eminent botanist. After marriage she wrote another semi autobiographical work,  <em>Lil Lorimer </em>, and a book for children,  <em>Cape Town Dicky </em>, illustrated by her sister Alice <a href=\"/biographies/havers_alice\">HAVERS</a>. During the 1890s she wrote two books of fiction for girls which are set in the Falkland Islands:  <em>The Little Colonists  </em>(1890) and <em>An Island Princess  </em>(1893). These give a vivid picture of the isolated life of the colonists and careful descriptions of landscape and flora. She does not evade difficult topics like alcoholism or over-zealous missionaries. The stories celebrate practical, confident and independent minded young women and indeed a determination to speak up for working women is a feature of all her work. She did not publish after 1901.

        "body": " <p>general manager FIC, was the eldest son of Thomas Havers, from a prominent Catholic family of Thelton Hall, Norfolk and Dorothy, née Charlton. Like all his brothers, Thomas was educated at Stonyhurst in Lancashire. One brother, John (FRCS), fathered a prolific Anglican family while another, William Joseph, died unmarried in Río de Janeiro in 1847. Brothers Robert (d 1860) Charles (d 1866) and Arthur became Jesuit priests.</p><p>Thomas Havers married Ellen, daughter of the Rev Rogers Ruding, a numismatist, at the parish church of St Marylebone, London on 1 February 1844. He worked for the London firm of Ricketts, Boutcher &amp; Co and was 'confidential clerk' to William Boutcher, one of the first directors of the Falkland Islands Company. By 1851, Havers was acting secretary of the FIC and three years later was appointed colonial manager. Havers embarked for the Falklands but was shipwrecked off the Welsh coast and had to set off once more, this time by Royal Mail steamer from Southampton. (The FIC board in February 1854 contributed £5 to replace the clothing of his governess and his servant lost in the wreck). The cost of the voyage for the Havers family was put at £200 for he travelled with his wife and four children as well as two servants. On his way to the Falklands, Havers stayed with SF <a href=\"/biographies/lafone_samuel\">LAFONE</a> at Montevideo and visited saladeros (slaughter and salting yards). His misgivings were expressed to the board:</p><blockquote><blockquote>I cannot trust myself to state without more reflection my feelings on finding the veil gradually dropping as I approach from so miserable a picture that at a distance presented such splendid colours. Mr Lafone describes Stanley as nothing, all to be begun; the Camp Manager speaks of a worthless country without stock and all just in time it would seem to save me the pain of reporting the naked facts - I am sure your H[onourable] Board will excuse these expressions which may be hasty when you reflect that I have just received the news of all leaving as it were an empty house, to which at immense risk I have brought a delicate wife some thousands of miles.</blockquote></blockquote><p>He arrived in the Islands in the brigantine <em>Amelia </em>on 9 May 1854 and lived with 'a family of eight in two smoky rooms, three in a bed and some on the floor' as his predecessor John Pownall <a href=\"/biographies/dale_john\">DALE</a> would not vacate the FIC's property, Malvina Cottage. Scarcely four months after arriving in Stanley, Havers' delicate wife Ellen died.</p><p>A little over a year later, on 16 October 1855 he married the governess Mary Clare Coppinger in the barracks at Anson (Port Louis), Berkeley Sound with the colonial chaplain the Rev Henry Martyn <a href=\"/biographies/faulkner_henry\">FAULKNER</a> officiating. She was a member of a well-known East Cork family involved in the corn and malt trade with three residences in Midleton. There were four sons from this union, George (born on the day of the marriage), Robert Falkland (b1857), Kenneth Joseph (b1859) and Alfred (b1860). There was a flurry of official correspondence in December 1855 over the registration and exact sequence of the marriage and George's birth.</p><p>Despite being married according to the rites and ceremonies of the established church in London 1844 and by the Church of England colonial chaplain eleven years later, Havers was very committed to his faith and organised the Catholics in Stanley to attend a prayer service on Sundays followed by catechism classes for children. He wrote widely to try to obtain the services of a resident priest, with letters to Cardinal Wiseman in London, Cardinal Barnabó in Rome and Archbishop Cullen in Dublin. Fr Lawrence <a href=\"/biographies/kirwan_lawrence\">KIRWAN</a> came from Buenos Aires in 1857 and stayed for six months and together with Havers helped set up <em>The Catholic Fund </em>to obtain a plot of land and to build a chapel or church. In some respects, Havers was ecumenical in his actions long before it became customary, advising Governor <a href=\"/biographies/moore_thomas\">MOORE</a> on 6 November 1856 that he 'presents the new Church the five octave organ lately belonging to Captain <a href=\"/biographies/snow_william\">SNOW</a> which I do on behalf of the Court of Directors [of the FIC]...' Five days later he advised that a cover had been ordered for the new organ and he awaited the Governor's command to deliver it to the Church, in the meantime 'it is in a well aired room at my house'. Finally on 3 June 1857 he advised Governor Moore that the organ was presented to the Protestant Church in the name of the directors of FIC.</p><p>If Havers wrote prolifically in his efforts to obtain a resident Catholic priest, then his correspondence with FIC in London was yet more voluminous. But all was not well. The FIC AGM of August 1858 noted that 'the directors regret that they are compelled to terminate the Company's engagement with Mr Havers, as soon as arrangements can be made for his being relieved...' That was to take some time and the local accounts were in such disorder that the August 1860 AGM mentions 'Mr Havers' culpable disregard of the Board's instructions and from his having kept his accounts in such negligent confusion... that the whole of the Island Accounts have in consequence been sent to England'. Fraud was never attributed to Havers who was replaced as colonial manager by James <a href=\"/biographies/lane_james\">LANE</a>, a solicitor in the firm of Rhodes, Lane &amp; Rhodes. Lane arrived in Stanley, displaced Havers and turned him, wife and children out of the manager's house, stopped his salary and effectively left him destitute. Unable to pay his passage home Havers started painting portraits and working as a labourer. By letter of 17 March 1860, Havers advised Anthony Fahy OP of the massacre of members of the Patagonian Missionary Society:</p><blockquote><blockquote>As I had painted portraits of six of the last lot of natives including two of the principal murderers, I was desirous of adding Jemmy [Button] to my collection &amp; accordingly had him two days at my house. He had heard much of me before &amp; so was on easy terms and very communicative on all matters except the massacre to which he never alluded in the slightest degree.</blockquote></blockquote><p>There is a further interesting reference to his painting in a letter of 12 November 1860 to the secretary of state (the Duke of Newcastle) when Governor Moore notes that 'a very careful set of correct drawings in colour from nature of the chief animals of the Colony is now in course of preparation by Thomas Havers Esq. of Stanley, with a view to publication hereafter'. The whereabouts of all his paintings is unknown.</p><p>Within FIC, Havers' appointment as colonial manager had been a cause of some disagreement and at the FIC extraordinary general meeting of August 1861, William Boutcher remarked that another director 'had said to me that he never much liked the appointment of Mr Havers because he was a Roman Catholic &amp; a Jesuit'. Some time during 1861 Havers and family moved to Montevideo. He founded <em>The Montevideo Times  </em>newspaper which appeared from 1864 to 1865 - a venture which proved unsuccessful - and then became director of public works. There are indications that he had a working relationship with the British consul in Montevideo. Havers remained in Uruguay (possibly living off the money he had received from the sale of Thelton) where he died in 1870, and his surviving children returned to England. Thomas Havers wrote his will in 1864 appointing his brother Arthur and his solicitors his executors, with provisions for his wife Mary Clare and his younger children, provision having been made already for his eldest son Thomas.</p><p>His son Kenneth Joseph Havers (FRGS) an artist was active in Catholic circles in London, while his daughters Alice Mary <a href=\"/biographies/havers_alice\">HAVERS</a> and Dorothy Henrietta <a href=\"/biographies/havers_dorothy\">HAVERS</a> became well-known as an artist and as a writer respectively.</p><p>Thomas Havers was a talented but complex individual. Robert W Havers of Consett, Co Durham writing in 1992 summed him up: 'Thomas is generally regarded as being the black sheep of the Havers family (and therefore more interesting than most)'. For the Havers family, he is accused of being the brother who through inept managership caused the family home and lands to be put into receivership and sold to the Mann brewing family - the present owners.</p>",

        "body": "<p>naval commander and explorer, was born in Plymouth, the natural (and only) son of Sir John Hawkins. His stepmother (from January 1567) was Katherine Gonson, daughter of Benjamin Gonson, treasurer of the navy.</p><p>Hawkins's early years are obscure. In 1582 he sailed in his uncle William Hawkins's voyage to Brazil and the Caribbean, and, in 1585, as captain of the galliot  <em>Duck </em>, in Sir Francis Drake's West Indies raid. During the 1588 Armada campaign he commanded the Queen's ship  <em>Swallow </em>. In 1590, as captain of the  <em>Nonpareil </em>, he sailed in his father's Atlantic squadron, despatched to intercept the returning Spanish plate fleets.</p><p>In June 1593, intending a reprise of Drake's 1577-80 circumnavigation, Hawkins departed Plymouth in the ship  <em>Dainty </em>. By November, he was at the Santa Anna Islands off the Brazilian coast. After taking in water at Isla Grande, the expedition set a course for the Strait of Magellan. On 2 February 1594, Hawkins sighted an uncharted land; according to his later  <em>Observations </em>, this was in 48 degrees latitude, but his master, John Ellis, put it at 50 degrees, and Hawkins may deliberately have misplaced his 'discovery' to deflect foreign attention. Driven by a strong westerly wind,  <em>Dainty </em>followed the coastline for some 60 leagues (180 miles) thereafter, observing a low, grassy landscape not unlike England's, 'a goodly Champion country [ie well-grassed], and peopled ...' (this from the evidence of fire-smoke). Before departing, Hawkins named the new land  <em>Hawkins's Maidenland </em>.</p><p> <em>Dainty </em>entered the Pacific later that month and revictualled at Mocha Island, Chile in April. In May, Hawkins and his men stormed and partially sacked the settlement of Valparaiso; but off San Mateo the  <em>Dainty </em>was intercepted by two Spanish galleons. Following a three day running fight the badly mauled English expedition surrendered.</p><p>Hawkins remained a prisoner, first at Lima and then in a Seville prison, until 1602, when, through the offices of Sir Robert Cecil, he was released. Returning to Plymouth, he became the town's mayor (1603-4) and was knighted by James I. Elected to Parliament and appointed vice-admiral of Devon in 1604, he swiftly gained a reputation for obstructing the operation of tribunals dealing with piracy and for taking bribes from alleged pirates.</p><p>Nevertheless, his association with more respectable maritime projects continued, though he was not given a further significant appointment at sea until 1620, when he sailed as vice-admiral in Sir Robert Mansell's unsuccessful expedition against the Barbary corsairs. The rigours of the voyage undermined Hawkins' health; back in England and summoned to appear before the Privy Council on 16 April 1622 to explain the expedition's failure, he collapsed in the council chamber and died. His  <em>Observations </em>of his Pacific voyage, begun in captivity and completed shortly before his death, was published in 1622.</p><p>Some weeks prior to departing England in 1593, Hawkins married Judith Hele (c 1565-1629) by whom he had four daughters and two sons.</p><p>In the early twentieth century, a lively debate ensued on whether  <em>Hawkins's Maidenland  </em>represented the second sighting by Englishmen of the Falkland Islands. Commander BM Chambers ( <em>Geographical Journal </em>, 1901) argued that Hawkins's description of the landmass did not sustain this interpretation, and placed his 'discovery' on the South American mainland. In the same journal, twenty-five years later, H <a href=\"/biographies/henniker_heaton\">HENNIKER HEATON</a> (later governor of the Falklands) disagreed. His claim that Hawkins navigated Falklands Sound cannot be substantiated; but the protracted westerly course of Hawkins' reconnaissance, if accurately reported, rules out any possibility that he was off the mainland at that latitude, and indicates that he had indeed sighted the Falkland Islands. Sir William Monson, the privateer and admiral, writing two years after Hawkins's death, assumed the land to be a northern promontory of the elusive southern continent  <em>Terra Australis </em>.</p>",

A bricklayer by trade, he entered the Royal Sappers &amp; Miners in 1836 and was commended for his talent and energy in the tuition of officer cadets at Sandhurst and Woolwich. He took part in an expedition to define the borders between Canada and the US state of Maine. As sergeant he was the senior sapper in the party of twelve which accompanied Lt Richard <a href=\"/biographies/moody_richard\">MOODY</a> RE when he sailed to the Falkland Islands on the brig <em>Hebe </em>, arriving on 15 January 1842.</p><p>During their six years on the Falklands the sapper detachment was kept constantly busy preparing housing for the governor and his staff, building jetties, preparing roads, digging drainage and surveying. Moody relied on Hearnden in a wide range of tasks. In September 1842 he rode out to Second Corral on Port Salvador and produced an excellent report with plans of the corral. In 1843 the secretary of state decided to move the seat of government from Port Louis to Port William (Stanley) and on 18 August Hearnden read a proclamation to this effect to the colonists at Port Louis. The detachment marched overland to Port William and a letter from Hearnden to Moody, dated 29 December from the new site reports progress in assembling houses and difficulties in unloading casks of lime. In April 1845 a crisis shook the tiny society of Stanley: four of the sappers were imprisoned prior to being shipped home. Hearnden wrote to Moody: 'I consider the whole Colony to be in a bad state...I know a great deal of what goes on and am often very anxious. At times I have made up my mind to the probability of being assassinated'. In the event the recalcitrant sappers were safely embarked on HMS <em>Philomel </em>, and in his despatch to the Colonial Office Moody commended Hearnden, whom he said deserved the highest praise. The remainder of his term in the Islands was spent in constructing the basics for the new capital always under harsh conditions, but with the compensation of an allowance of 4s 6d a day. Hearnden was accompanied by his brother Thomas Hearnden, a butcher who was employed as gaoler in 1848. Robert Hearnden returned home with four members of the original party and Governor Moody in July 1848.</p><p>A word on his horse: Blanco was brought from South America, showed signs of breeding and was perfectly white. Though Hearnden had paid over the odds, he was very satisfied with Blanco's usefulness and robustness. On 7 January 1847 Blanco won the Governor's Cup - worth £50, a very considerable sum. Made of silver by Hunt and Roskill, the cup stood 18 inches high and the Sergeant was represented on one side mounted with sword, sabretache and gauntlets.</p><p>On his return to England, Hearnden purchased his discharge for £6 on 28 February 1849. He married Sarah Ann Williams on 11 February 1849 in St Botolph's Church in the City of London. With his savings of nearly £1,000 he emigrated to America, where - reported the historian of the Sappers in 1857, 'from his enterprising spirit and commercial tact, he is realising a fortune'. One Robert Hearndon (1815-1867) is buried in Maple River Cemetery, Minnesota, USA, as is his wife Sarah (1830-1911).</p><p>He is remembered by Hearnden Water near Stanley and Hearnden Hill near Port Louis.</p>",

        "body": "<p>governor, was born in New South Wales, Australia, on 9 February 1880, the third son of Sir John Henniker Heaton, the imperial postal reformer, and his wife Rose, née Bennett. He was educated at Eton and New College, Oxford, where he read history and was a keen oarsman. On leaving university he joined the Colonial Service and his first posting was as a cadet to Fiji in 1902. In 1909 he married Phoebe Talbot-Crosbie of Ardfert, Co Kerry and in 1913 he was appointed assistant colonial secretary of Mauritius. This was followed by promotion to colonial secretary of The Gambia in 1918 and in 1921 he was appointed colonial secretary of the Falkland Islands.</p><p>Accompanied by his wife and three children, Patrick (b1910) Rose Anne (b1914) and Priscilla (b1916) he arrived in the Falklands on the liner  <em>Orcoma </em>on 12 September 1921. Sadly his wife died less than a year later, giving birth to their fourth child, Dermot. A Celtic cross with a Latin inscription marks her grave in Stanley cemetery. The children were looked after by their nurse, Miss Fraser, and the older ones invited to stay by kind friends in Camp, notably the Millers at Hill Cove and the Feltons at West Point, until they could be returned to the care of relatives in Britain. Their father remained in post, serving as acting governor for almost a year from June 1923 until May 1924. During that time, the question of an official crest for the Falklands was raised. The Islands' old 'badge' depicting a bullock and a sailing ship was still in use, but no proper Coat of Arms had ever been officially granted. Some ideas for different designs had already been considered when the Irish yachtsman, Conor <a href=\"/biographies/obrien_edward\">O'BRIEN</a> arrived in the Islands in 1924 in his yacht  <em>Saoirse </em>with a beautifully painted insignia on the stern. Henniker Heaton enquired who the artist was and when he discovered it was O'Brien himself, asked if he would design a new crest for the Falklands. O'Brien produced a drawing of a shield with a sea-lion and ship, which after approval by councillors, the College of Arms and the British government, was officially adopted in 1925. It remained in use until after World War II, but was found too difficult to reproduce properly and in 1948 the current crest showing a sheep over a representation of the ship  <em>Desire </em>was introduced. The 1925 crest however, was retained by the FIDF and is still used by them today.</p><p>In 1925 Henniker Heaton was appointed Colonial Secretary of Bermuda. On his departure from the Falklands the  <em>Church Magazine </em>reported:</p><blockquote><blockquote>A great number of people will regret his leaving. As Colonial Secretary he was always accessible and willing to give whatever assistance lay in his power. During the time that he was acting Governor, Mr. Heaton proved a conspicuous success and richly deserved the high praise which His Excellency the Governor [Sir John <a href=\"/biographies/middleton_sir\">MIDDLETON]</a> bestowed upon him at the first meeting of the Legislative Council after his return from leave.</blockquote></blockquote><p>The report went on to say: 'Mr. Heaton was also a liberal patron of sport. The prizes he gave to the Race Meetings on the West and in Stanley were valuable and valued. In addition, Mr. Heaton was an active member of the Stanley Sports Association'. Henniker Heaton had also become interested in farming during his time in the Falklands and in 1923 the Government Printing Office published his  <em>Comparative Notes on Sheep Farming in the Falkland Islands and in South Patagonia. </em></p><p>In 1926 Henniker Heaton married Helena Iris McCallum, who tragically died the following year giving birth to their son, Christopher. Henniker Heaton continued to serve in Bermuda and in 1928 was awarded the CMG. In 1929, having been voted a special grant by the Colonial Parliament in Bermuda for 'signal services rendered to the Colony, <em>' </em>he moved to Cyprus, where he spent five years as colonial secretary. In 1934 he was once more appointed to the Falkland Islands, this time as governor. He arrived in Stanley on the liner  <em>Reina del Pacifico  </em>on 10 February 1935, accompanied by his two daughters, and assumed office the same day. He started his opening address with the words: 'The aim and purpose of Government is the happiness of the governed and with your assistance I shall endeavour to do my best to contribute towards that end'.</p><p>Henniker Heaton's term of office in the Falklands came at a time when the Islands were experiencing the economic Depression of the 1930s. In order to reinvigorate farming in the Falklands, he proposed a radical plan: to subdivide all farms larger than 24,000 acres and make land available, primarily to native Falkland Islanders, but also to European refugees, of whom, due to the rise of Nazism, there were increasing numbers. His policy was supported by the government's agricultural adviser, DS Weir, who considered that 'the cutting up of the land will automatically deal with matters which are now being tackled piece-meal and with little hope of success'. The agronomist, William <a href=\"/biographies/davies_william\">DAVIES</a>, also advocated subdivision. However bearing in mind Governor <a href=\"/biographies/goldsworthy_sir\">GOLDSWORTHY</a>'s failed attempt to widen land ownership in the Islands forty years earlier, Henniker Heaton wrote to the Colonial Office that 'there is no doubt that attempts at subdivision now will be met with deep resentment and hostility'. <em> </em>Perhaps as a result of this advice, London did not support his proposals and although Henniker Heaton's successor, <a href=\"/biographies/cardinall_sir\">CARDINALL</a>, also promoted the plan, the subject was effectively to lie dormant for a further forty years, until revived by Lord SHACKLETON.</p><p>In 1937 Henniker Heaton was promoted to KCMG in the first honours list of King George VI. The <em>Penguin </em>commented that the award 'may be regarded as a compliment to the Colony as the title has hitherto been strictly limited as a Colonial Service honour to Governors of larger Colonies' <em>.  </em>In the same year, while on leave in Britain, he formally handed over to the Sea Scouts, represented by HRH the Duke of Kent, the RRS  <em>Discovery </em>, Captain Scott's old ship, which had latterly been used for the Southern Ocean scientific programme Discovery Investigations,</p><p>This was the second time Henniker Heaton had become involved in an effort to preserve an historic ship. In 1936 when proposals were made to beach or sink the hulk of the  <em>Great Britain </em>, then moored in Stanley Harbour, the  <em>Penguin </em>carried the following report:</p><blockquote><blockquote>The 25th of May next will be the fiftieth anniversary of the arrival of the 'Great Britain' at Port William on the completion in 1886 of her last voyage after 40 years of battling with the oceans of the world. It appeared to the Governor that if at all possible this famous vessel which has lain for half a century in our waters should be preserved and something of the appearance of her great days restored. His Excellency is accordingly seeking the advice of those best qualified to judge on the practicability of saving and renovating her. It is estimated that not less than £5,000 will be required and His Excellency has written tentatively to the Lord Mayor of Bristol enquiring whether he would open a subscription list in the United Kingdom when a public appeal is made in the press.</blockquote></blockquote><p>George ROBERTS, the colonial engineer, was asked for an assessment and a few weeks later the <em>Penguin </em>reported:</p><blockquote><blockquote>With reference to the notice published ... regarding the proposed restoration of the 'Great Britain', we have to announce that on full examination it has been ascertained to the Governor's great regret that that it would cost over £10,000 to preserve the vessel without re-masting her and that under the circumstances it is not possible to proceed with the project.</blockquote></blockquote><p>However it was ensured that she would be beached in Sparrow Cove, rather than sunk, which allowed for her recovery and restoration some thirty years later.</p><p>In 1939 Henniker Heaton had just tendered his resignation to the Colonial Office, effective from his 60th birthday in February 1940, when World War II broke out. He immediately withdrew his resignation for the duration of hostilities and became occupied with the task of establishing the Islands on a war footing. The FIDF were called out and coast-watching units set up at strategic points. After the Battle of the River Plate in December 1939, the resources of Stanley were fully stretched when HMSS  <em>Exeter </em>,  <em>Ajax </em>,  <em>Achilles </em>and  <em>Cumberland </em>returned to the Islands and the wounded were brought to the King Edward VII Memorial Hospital.  <em>Exeter </em>was so badly damaged that even her able-bodied ship's company had to be billeted ashore while the ship underwent repair. When  <em>Exeter </em>left the Islands a month later, Captain <a href=\"/biographies/bell_frederick\">BELL</a> wrote to assure the governor 'that the officers and men of 'EXETER' will long cherish their thoughts of the Falkland Islands and all the memories that go with them'.</p><p>Henniker Heaton himself left the Falklands almost exactly a year later, on 28 January 1941, after seeing his younger daughter, Priscilla, married in Stanley Cathedral in October 1940. His colonial secretary, Allan Wolsey Cardinall, who was to follow him as governor, sent a farewell message: 'The people of the Falkland Islands and myself wish you all happiness in your well-earned retirement. We cannot forget the care and love you have shown us in the past and the interest you took in all that made for our welfare'. Although now officially retired, Henniker Heaton went directly to Bermuda, where he had been asked to act as colonial secretary for the duration of the war. His elder daughter, Anne, returned to Britain to volunteer for war service and in 1945 married Norman Keith <a href=\"/biographies/cameron_norman\">CAMERON</a> of Port San Carlos. Henniker Heaton finally retired in 1945 and in 1947 married Gladys Going, widow of Colonel George Going and daughter of Colonel Claud Francis. He died in Hove, Sussex on 24 January 1961.</p><p>Henniker Heaton was trained in the formal traditions of the British Colonial Service and in his role as governor he is remembered as having been thoughtful, judicious and occasionally somewhat imperious in manner. However he was also a kind, affectionate, enthusiastic and sociable man, who, wherever he was in the world throughout his career, never lost sight of his principal aim, to promote 'the happiness of the governed'.</p>",

Here he remained for the rest of his life, becoming a man of high standing in the community, known for his business undertakings and personal qualities.</p><p>In Punta Arenas he struck up a friendship with the German, Rodolfo Strubenrauch, who was managing the business interests of the local branch of the firm Wehrhahn Hermanos y Cía of Valparaíso, and simultaneously acting as British vice-consul in Magallanes. Both men grew to be great friends, as well as becoming brothers-in-law, as in 1895 Hobbs married Sara María Teresa Bloom (born 1869 in Punta Arenas) and Stubenrauch married Aara Bloom, two daughters of Guillermo Bloom, an emigré Russian, the first blacksmith of the Magallanes colony, and Teresa Muñoz from Chiloé. Ernest Hobbs and Sara had seven daughters and three sons.</p><p>In 1883, Wehrhahn Hnos y Cía obtained the first land concession in Tierra del Fuego, 123,000 hectares on the west coast of Isla Grande. There they established the Estancia Gente Grande, given over to sheep farming with stock brought over from the Falkland Islands. Subsequently Stubenrauch and Hobbs became partners in the enterprise, which led in 1904 to the formation of Sociedad Ganadera Gente Grande, in which they were the major investors. Hobbs was appointed manager, a position he held for many years. The Estancia Gente Grande was one of the most important sheep-rearing establishments in Magallanes, running flocks numbering 100,000 head. Towards 1914, the Sociedad acquired the right to rent Isla Dawson, in the Strait of Magellan, where another large sheep estancia was established, together with a sawmill and dockyard.</p><p>Hobbs himself invested in the Sociedad Ballenera de Magallanes, (Whaling Company of Magallanes) of which he was elected president in 1911, and also in other industrial, commercial and farming enterprises. Among these was the business of Hobbs y Cía, in which he was joined by Mauricio Braun, Francisco Campos and others. This company obtained an important concession to rent land in the Territorio de Aysén, in southern central Chilean Patagonia, which led to the founding of the large Estancia Valle Chacabuco.</p><p>Hobbs' personal qualities as a cultivated, benevolent and educated man, together with his willingness to serve in the community, led to his appointment as the first alcalde (or honorary mayor) of Punta Arenas by the provincial government of Magallanes, a post he held from 1919 to 1925 to general approval. He was also actively engaged in the British community in organisations like the British Association of Magallanes, the Anglican Society and other groups, in which his outstanding contribution to the public good is well remembered.</p>",

He undertook theological training and attended St. Edmund's Hall, Oxford and the Lichfield Theological College. In 1907 he was ordained deacon, followed in 1909 by ordination as a priest. Between 1907 and 1909 he was assistant curate at St James, Lower Gornall in Staffordshire. Following that he served as assistant curate in Upper Stratton near Swindon and in Ramsgate.</p><p>On 31 January 1912 he married 22 year-old Vera Gladys Blanchard, a doctor's daughter, at Sevenoaks, Kent, and later that year he left for the Falkland Islands to take up the post of assistant chaplain at Christ Church Cathedral, Stanley, arriving on the  <em>Orcoma  </em>on <em> </em>11 December 1912. He should have sailed on the ill-fated  <em>Oravia </em>but was delayed, although his furniture and effects were on the ship when she was wrecked on the Billy Rock in Port William. Thus the family arrived at the Church House with no possessions.</p><p>Hobley was a keen trained musician, having been a chorister at St Paul's Cathedral for seven years and a choirmaster of the school choir in Derby, where he was also first lieutenant and acting captain of the Officers Training Corps; he was keen to work with young people and while near Swindon had organised the largest group of Boy Scouts in England. On their arrival in Stanley, Mrs Hobley was pregnant and in February 1913 she gave birth to their first child, Betty Malvina Louise.</p><p>Hobley's musical training stood him in good stead while he was in the Falklands as he was able to direct and produce entertainment for the Islanders; his first production was in June 1913 when he directed a musical programme for the annual dinner of the Stanley branch of the Overseas Club. At the end of June he embarked on the first of several Camp visits, visiting 32 houses and conducting 13 services.</p><p>In April 1915, Edward James Seymour resigned as dean of Christ Church Cathedral, leaving in June. The following October, the Rev J Stanley Smith accepted the post and for a while considered bringing his own priest with him. Thus Hobley's incumbency was in jeopardy, but he retained his position. He took over the Stanley Scout Troop that month. His son was born on 9 June 1917 and christened Denys Jack McDonald on 28 July (later to become known as McDonald <a href=\"/biographies/hobley_denis\">HOBLEY</a>, one of BBC television's first and most popular announcers). During the five years he spent in the Falklands, Hobley played an important part in Stanley affairs both ecclesiastical and social as he and his wife supported every club and event and the  <em>Church Magazine </em>benefited from his help as editor, contributor, printer, mechanic and anything else required. He was not universally popular however and was considered to be anti-government, apparently denouncing the governor of the colony (Governor <a href=\"/biographies/allardyce_sir\">ALLARDYCE)</a> as a 'moral bully' the lowest and 'most degraded and most loathsome level to which the Devil can bring a man'. When war broke out he publicly derided the local volunteers and the defence preparations being made. He was also openly critical of Admiral <a href=\"/biographies/cradock_sir\">CRADOCK</a>'s decisions before the ill-fated battle of Coronel and it was decided that his contract would not be renewed on its termination.</p><p>In 1918 the Hobleys were due to leave for the Cape Verde Islands where he had been appointed chaplain but war conditions prevented him from travelling there and instead he was sent to Valparaiso where he became temporary assistant chaplain to the English Church. He remained in Chile until 1927 returning to England to become principal... of St. Peter's Court School in Burgess Hill and licensed priest of the Diocese of Chichester. The family moved to Hove and he became vicar of the Old Church in 1938. He died on 20 May 1951 in the Royal Sussex County Hospital, Hove.</p><p>In 1917 Hobley wrote and produced a small guide and history of the Falklands which was sold with all profits going to Christ Church Cathedral. It included an anthem 'Furthest South' written by him and later set to music by Sister Rosa <a href=\"/biographies/veneroni_rosa\">VENERONI</a> who, as well as teaching at St Mary's School, was the organist at the Catholic church.

He was the second child of the Rev Charles McDonald <a href=\"/biographies/hobley_charles\">HOBLEY</a> and his wife Gladys, née Blanchard, having an elder sister Betty Louise. His father was assistant chaplain of Christ Church Cathedral, Stanley between 1912 and 1918 when they left for Chile where the family stayed until 1928. Moving to Burgess Hill in Sussex, he attended Brighton College between 1931 and 1936. He began his acting career in repertory, acting under the name of Robert Blanchard, and toured before World War II in Priestley's <em>Time and the Conways </em>. During the war he joined the Royal Artillery and was involved in a bizarre plot, ultimately abandoned, to abduct Hitler and fly him to Britain - Hobley was among those briefed to seize the plane when it landed. He spent the last months of the war working for a forces radio station in Ceylon {Sri Lanka} which proved a turning point in his career.</p><p>In 1946, having changed his stage name to McDonald Hobley, he was selected from over 200 applicants for the new BBC television announcing job at a salary of £12 per week. He became effectively the face of BBC television and in 1954 he was voted 'TV Personality of the Year' having become very popular with viewers. His charm and wit made him a favourite for panel games and chat shows. Once, when out walking with Sir Laurence Olivier, he was asked for his autograph. He obliged and was then asked 'Does your friend act too?'</p><p>He 'defected' to the new commercial TV in 1956 being tempted by the £100 a week salary. However, although busy and popular he became unhappy with frequent appearances in childish programmes in which he felt he was called upon to make a fool of himself. His ITV contract ended after three years and he became chairman of the radio panel game <em>Does the Team Think? </em>, returning to BBC TV for two series of <em>It's a Knockout  </em>while expanding his career back in the theatre. His later career was varied but it never brought him the kudos of the earlier years; he appeared in the West End in the long-running farce <em>No Sex Please - We're British  </em>and various thrillers. There were a lot of TV roles in some of which he played himself. He acted in repertory and pantomimes and his last appearance just before his death was at Leatherhead in <em>Forty Years On </em>.</p><p>He continued to work for television and radio and in the year before he died McDonald Hobley returned to the Falklands for a Channel 4 programme about the South Atlantic Dependencies. He was interested in the stamps of the Falklands and was a member of the Falkland Islands Philatelic Study Group. He died on 30 July 1987 aged 70. He had been married three times and was survived by his third wife Pauline, his two earlier marriages having ended in divorce.</p>",

        "body": " <p>lighthouse keeper, was born in the Falkland Islands on 8 June 1852, the son of James Henry Hocking senior, a military pensioner who had arrived in the Islands in 1849 with his wife Ann Elizabeth, née Treveton, and was appointed government schoolmaster and later gaoler. James Hocking junior first worked for the Falkland Islands Company for three years of rigorous sheep farming, during which he would tend a flock of 4,500 to 5,000 sheep, often riding all day without seeing another soul or even a house and pitching a tent at night. This changed dramatically when in 1874 he became lighthouse keeper at Cape Pembroke, where he served for 27 years working shifts of six hours on and six hours off, tending the lights which guided mariners to the entrance to Stanley harbour. This was a vital service, particularly for vessels struggling to reach safety after suffering damage while rounding Cape Horn. However in spite of the lighthouse, ships still came to grief on the dangerous rocks near the entrance to Port William and Hocking witnessed many dramas such as the tragic wreck of the <em>City of Philadelphia </em>in 1896.</p><p>It was to the Islands in 1876 that the small vessel <em>Sea Witch </em>arrived after a journey of three months from London, marked in its final stage from Montevideo by a violent storm in which the passengers were battened down for three days. One of the passengers was Eliza Ann, daughter of Horatio Rees, who had worked at Bristol on the building of the SS <em>Great Britain </em>(which ended her sea-faring days in 1886 at Stanley). Eliza married James Hocking in Christ Church Cathedral on 14 August 1877, beginning an idyllic union which was celebrated in retirement with a golden wedding.</p><p>Hocking's sister Elizabeth Ann married another distinguished Islander, William James <a href=\"/biographies/coulson_william\">COULSON</a> in 1873, and following her death ten years later the Hockings looked after their children at the lighthouse. One of these, the teenage Charles Coulson, rode to Stanley to raise the alarm when the American ship <em>John R Kelly </em>foundered in 1899. The Hockings retired to Somerset: Eliza Hocking died in December 1928 and her husband followed in 1929.</p>",

        "body": "<p>governor, was born in Bovey Tracey, Devon on 12 February 1881, the son of Henry Algernon Hodson and Sara Wormald Wienholt. He was educated in Italy and Mulgrave Castle School, Yorkshire. At the age of 19 he emigrated to Australia where he worked on a sheep farm in central Queensland. In 1902, he enlisted as a corporal in the Australian Commonwealth Horse (Queensland) D squadron for the South African war. He departed for duty on 19 May but arrived too late for active service. This was the beginning of an extensive career in Africa. He worked in Durban before moving to Johannesburg and Pretoria with a government appointment. In 1904 he was commissioned into the police force of the Bechuanaland Protectorate at Mafeking, which involved a journey to the Kalahari Desert in 1905. One of Hodson's later missions was to the Damaraland frontier during the time of the Herero and Nama Wars in German South-West Africa {Namibia}. He was much involved in trying to reconcile conflicts between tribal chiefs and his several political missions covered an important part of the history of Bechuanaland. During this period he travelled extensively and published  <em>Trekking the Great Thirst: Travel and Sport in the Kalahari Desert </em>.</p><p>Hodson's subsequent African service was in the north; first as magistrate in British Somaliland (1912-14) and then as British consul in southern Abyssinia at Mega (1914-23) and in south-west Abyssinia at Magi (1923-26) (both now parts of Ethiopia). Again he travelled extensively (although on one trek things became so desperate he had to abandon his golf clubs in the Abyssinian highlands). A grammar of the Galla language (1922) and two more travel books resulted:  <em>Seven Years in Southern Abyssinia  </em>(1927) <em> </em>and <em>Where Lions Reign  </em>(1929).</p><p>On 22 December 1926 he was appointed governor of the Falkland Islands and Dependencies, a very different situation from his African experiences. Lt Col Alexander Elder <a href=\"/biographies/beattie_alexander\">BEATTIE</a> occupied the post of acting governor in Stanley until 8 June 1927 when Hodson arrived aboard MV  <em>Lagarto </em>; he was sworn into office on the next day. Thus, 9 June 1927 marks his formal assumption of administration of the Falkland Islands and Dependencies.</p><p>The whaling industry had become the principal source of revenue and a major source of contention in the Falklands at the time when Hodson arrived. An unexpected development during his period was the abandonment of the old floating factories moored in harbours and subject to governmental control, and their replacement by new factory ships operating on the high seas with, at the time, no regulation. This caused the deliberations on preserving the whaling industry of the Islands and Dependencies, by conservation of whale stocks, to become increasingly complex. Hodson visited the Dependencies to see personally their circumstances and the whaling industry.</p><p>In 1927, shortly after his arrival, he made a winter visit to South Georgia, the first by any governor. He travelled aboard  <em>Fleurus </em>(Capt C Adamson) a vessel contracted to deliver mail to the Dependencies in 1924.  <em>Fleurus  </em>left Stanley on 6 August and had returned by 13 August; thus it was a brief visit. His interest remained, however, and in the next year he returned to the Dependencies.</p><p>There was some controversy in his dealings with two scientific investigations. In 1924 Hugh <a href=\"/biographies/munro_hugh\">MUNRO</a>, a specialist from the New Zealand Department of Agriculture visited the colony and prepared a detailed report, recommending the establishment of an experimental farm, which was set up in February 1926. The farm was organized and livestock acquired with the support of the previous governor (Sir John <a href=\"/biographies/middleton_sir\">MIDDLETON)</a> and LegCo. Governor Hodson was, however, of a different opinion and, on 9 January 1928 wrote to the secretary of state that 'A grave error of judgement has been made throughout in the conception and the establishment of the Experimental Farm'. Thus the farm was closed shortly after it came into being.</p><p>Similarly he inveighed against the expenditure (from the colony's budget) on the Discovery Investigations. While there had been doubts about the value of the research, partly from the complaints of the Sheep Owners' Association, these culminated on 9 May 1928 in a 29 page memorandum which Hodson submitted to the secretary of state recording '... my unaltered and unalterable opinion [is] that the Discovery expedition and all its works should forthwith and forever cease'. This acrimonious altercation persisted with bitter comments from all sides despite an order from the secretary of state for the governor to apologise to the Discovery Committee. Hodson's judgement in these circumstances may be questioned in view of the subsequent utility of the Grassland Trials Unit and continuation of the Discovery Investigations.</p><p>Governor Hodson's second official visit to the Dependencies was much more comprehensive. He left Stanley on 2 February 1928, aboard  <em>Fleurus  </em>(Capt <em> </em>Lauritz <em> </em>Karlsen) and went to the South Shetland Islands where his first stop was at the Deception Island whaling station. Here he met many of the whalers, recorded notes on the industry, navigation problems and the distribution of sea ice. The voyage continued through the Neumayer Channel to Wiencke Island before turning north. On 17 February the South Orkney Islands were reached although the way was encumbered with pack ice.  <em>Fleurus  </em>called at Borge Bay, Signy Island, where they also met some whaling vessels. Subsequently Hodson interviewed a party of Argentine meteorologists bound for Laurie Island who provided details of the station and its newly installed radio transmitter.</p><p>South Georgia was reached on 22 February where the governor's arrival was saluted with 17 blasts of dynamite atop a small hill near Grytviken. Hodson inaugurated the whalers' summer sports and presented a 'Governor's Cup' on 23 February. At King Edward Point he also opened the new rifle range. The granite memorial over Sir Ernest Shackleton's grave was unveiled on 24 February by Hodson in the presence of the magistrate (Frederick Black <a href=\"/biographies/alison_frederick\">ALISON)</a> and his wife, a large group of administrative staff and whalers, and representatives from RRS  <em>William Scoresby  </em>of the Discovery Investigations. Stanley was reached on 1 March 1928. A note published in the  <em>Geographical Journal  </em>described the voyage and included a selection of photographs taken by Hodson (1929).</p><p>In 1928 the Falkland Islands and Dependencies Sealing Company was formed to exploit sea lions, originally from  <em>Belville </em>and later from a factory at Albemarle. For a variety of reasons, although it had the governor's endorsement, it proved unsuccessful.</p><p>Governor Hodson was on leave in Britain from 11 June 1928 to 9 January 1929. During this period he married Elizabeth Charlotte Sarah Hay on 15 November 1928 in Aberdeen. His new bride accompanied him to the Falkland Islands and after a later visit to Britain, returned in December 1929 with her father and sister.</p><p>Other events during his tenure as governor were many. Notably there are many indications of his enthusiasm for a variety of sports. Details of the scores for rifle shooting competitions, one of his particular hobbies, frequently appeared in the  <em>Government Gazette. </em>He was responsible for the building of the gymnasium and public baths. The former was used for boxing and gymnastics, both greatly encouraged by Hodson. The  <em>Church Magazine </em>reporting Hodson's first Stanley Sports meeting in 1927 reads:</p><blockquote><blockquote>For the racing on 26th December Mr. Hodson entered his two horses 'Hurstwood' and 'Aravel', which he had purchased shortly beforehand from Mr. J. Robertson of Port Stephens, for several races and to the general delight was successful in carrying off two seconds and two thirds. His Excellency rode 'Hurstwood' in the Corinthian race, open to Falkland Islands bred horses ridden by their owners at weights of twelve stone and over, and came in second in a really thrilling finish. This sporting action on the Governor's part was most enthusiastically welcomed. It is surely rare indeed that a Governor of any Colony actually takes part in a race on level terms with all-comers and in this Colony it has created a precedent which we shall hope to see followed in future.</blockquote></blockquote><p>In Stanley he also gave children's parties which were long remembered. His literary and theatrical activities included writing and directing two plays  <em>The Troubles of Santa Claus  </em>and <em>The Downfall of Zaccharia Fee.  </em>He was also a social reformer; among other things he was responsible for the abolition of fees for medical treatment and other improvements in public health, the introduction of the eight-hour working day, and the rediffusion broadcast system. The last, in Stanley and later in nearby Camp areas, was transmitted over the existing telephone wires until the mid 1980s.</p><p>Electric lighting, supplied from the wireless station, came to Stanley in 1929. Government House and the Town Hall were the earliest buildings illuminated before electrification began to be extended generally. This also allowed wireless transmission of the rediffusion service outside Stanley. The earliest of what is now known as 'social housing', inexpensive accommodation when house prices were high, was established in Stanley by the Governor and became known as 'Hodson Villas'. In Government House in 1930 the stables were converted by Hodson to provide four servants' bedrooms and a large recreation room in what had originally been the loft.</p><p>Hodson received a commission back in Africa in 1930 and left the Falkland Islands aboard RMS  <em>Orduna </em>on 3 February 1931, handing over the administration to John Medlicott <a href=\"/biographies/ellis_john\">ELLIS</a>, the colonial secretary, on the same day. Sierra Leone was his next destination where he became known as the 'sunshine governor' and introduced the wired rediffusion service there in 1934. During his tenure major mineral deposits were discovered. His last post was as governor of the Gold Coast {Ghana} from 1934 until his retirement in 1941. He inaugurated another rediffusion service in Accra.</p><p>Hodson and his wife had a son who died at birth in 1929, and two daughters, Jean Rosemary Hay (b1930) and Elizabeth Anne Hay (b1934). He died on 26 May 1944 in New York. He was decorated with several medals for African service and in 1922 awarded the CMG. He was advanced in 1932 to KCMG and subsequently became a <em> </em>Knight of Justice of the Order of St John of Jerusalem. He was a vice-president of the National Rifle Association in the United States and listed his recreations as big game hunting and fishing, yachting, golf, and rifle shooting. The National Portrait Gallery, London, has a formal photograph of him taken on 1 October 1928 by the Bassano and Vandyck Studio. Two place-names in the Falkland Islands Dependencies commemorate him, both mapped by the Discovery Investigations in 1930: Hodson Point is in Fortuna Bay, South Georgia, and Mount Hodson, the highest peak of the icecap of Visokoi Island, South Sandwich Islands (1005m).</p><p>Although his Falkland years were a brief interval in a varied and colourful career spent mainly in Africa, Hodson did much to enliven and improve Stanley. But his closure of the experimental farm put the cause of agricultural development in the Islands back by a generation.</p><p><a href=\"/biographies/alison_frederick\">See Image 5</a><br><a href=\"?q=node/424\">See Image 310</a></p>",

        "body": " <p>was born in Booking, Essex, the son of Dr. George Cook Holmested and his wife Mary, née Nottidge. The family had been long established in Booking, near Braintree, Ernest's father being fourth in a line of doctors. Young Holmested could not contemplate following his father's profession, preferring the outdoor life, and the family sent him to gain experience on a sheep farm at Matson's, Timaru, New Zealand. He sailed on 17 April 1865 at the age of 19 and enjoyed the long journey, making many friends on the way. His stay in New Zealand was rewarding and he acquired valuable skills and experience, forming a strong friendship with New Zealander Wickham <a href=\"/biographies/bertrand_william\">BERTRAND</a>. The two decided to widen their horizons and acquire land for sheepfarming on their own account. They decided on South America, arriving at Valparaiso, Chile, on 12 August 1867. After travelling to Santiago they decided to cross the Andes and joined up with other New Zealanders. They set off on mules but had to abandon them because of snow, continuing the hazardous journey on foot, overcoming the weather and shortages of food. Holmested was a fit young man who enjoyed life and remained cheerful throughout, encouraging Bertrand through spells of sickness and exposure. They proceeded through bandit country to Cordoba where a cholera epidemic claimed the life of one of their group. The two friends received business offers in Argentina but none appealed to them.</p><p>They were then informed by an agent of excellent prospects of land for sheepfarming in the Falkland Islands. Bertrand and another of their party, the German Switzer, decided to visit the Falklands to look at possibilities with Holmested remaining in Argentina to preserve funds. He undertook temporary work until the two men returned with the welcome news that they had leased Shallow Bay, in West Falkland. They had also obtained a lease on New Island which would provide the sheep and cattle they needed at Shallow Bay. The three men sailed on the schooner <em>Louise  </em>and arrived on 3 July 1868 after a hazardous journey. The Shallow Bay and New Island documentation was in the names of Bertrand and Switzer but now Holmested was formally brought in and appointed to manage Adelaide Station (as the new Shallow Bay farm was called) and to supervise the movement of stock from New Island.</p><p>Holmested went to New Island on the Mission schooner <em>Allen Gardiner. </em>The ship left with the wool leaving Holmested with just two shepherds to restore and organize the farm before the arrival of Jacob <a href=\"/biographies/lee_jacob\">LEE</a> and his wife who were to run it later in the year. When the schooner <em>Fairy </em>arrived with Switzer on board they were able to ship the stock to Shallow Bay. To establish Shallow Bay as a well founded, well organised and viable sheepfarm required many years of very hard work and much hardship: Holmested's early days, for example, were spent under canvas stretched over boulders. Adelaide Station benefited from the new sheep-dipping process pioneered by Bertrand for the Falkland Islands Company which was remarkably successful in reducing the incidence of scab*. The lack of fencing was a problem and the absence of a vegetable garden posed problems for food supplies. Early settlers like Holmested encountered setbacks almost daily such as the loss of favourite horses and unexplained deaths of rams through sickness. The farm expanded, however, with the recruitment of extra hands. Bertrand completed his work for the Falkland Islands Company and was able to join Holmested at Shallow Bay, enabling Holmested to take leave to England in 1871. Bertrand had married Catherine Felton and now had two children but friction was developing between the two men and Holmested took the opportunity of leave to seek a new partner.</p><p>Holmested returned with a contemporary named Rees and they jointly acquired Adelaide Station of 110,000 acres with Bertrand taking a Crown Lease on 171,000 acres elsewhere on West Falkland. Following a difficult start the two men worked together well but Rees returned to England to marry and the relationship between the men was never again a happy one. Both Bertrand and Rees were newly married and perhaps understandably their loyalties and priorities were mixed. Holmested was a dedicated hard-working man who set high standards and aimed to maintain and develop what he had achieved to date. He was not, however, wholly single-minded, being a likeable man who enjoyed life. Both Holmested and Bertrand had developed a liking and trust for the Falkland Islands Company's colonial manager, FE <a href=\"/biographies/cobb_frederick\">COBB</a>, which was reciprocated and was now to have a great influence on the future of Adelaide Station. Cobb had married Emily Blake and returned to the colony with his bride and her brother Robert <a href=\"/biographies/blake_robert\">BLAKE</a> who was on an exploratory visit. Cobb and Holmested arranged for Blake to stay at Adelaide for a while and he quickly established an affinity with Holmested which led to him replacing Rees in the partnership from 31 January 1874. Their partnership survived religious and personal differences and endured until the farm was sold to the Government for sub-division in the aftermath of the 1982 conflict with Argentina. Cobb wrote of them in 1875: 'Mr. Ernest Holmested, the principal, is, like his partner, exceedingly energetic and they bear the reputation of being the most hardest workers in the West Falkland'.</p><p>The farm grew and developed in the face of setbacks and fluctuations in the wool market. Running a sheepfarm in the Falkland Islands has always been a difficult life for a single man and these two young farming pioneers often talked of their plans for the future, inevitably, given the shortage of feminine company in the Islands, looking to England for wives. They did not have an easy life with their working day during the peak season extending from 4am to 8·30pm.</p><p>Blake became engaged whilst on leave in 1878 and planned to marry in 1880 but Holmested exercised his seniority by marrying in June 1880 Edith Templar Davies, the daughter of a doctor from Hampstead, London. The two marriages meant that an agreement was necessary on accommodation and this was achieved by establishing a new main settlement at Hill Cove where the Blakes would live with the Holmesteds remaining at Adelaide Station. The farm prided itself on its forward-looking policies particularly in the breeding of rams and land drainage. Stocks increased annually, weather permitting, and reached 25,000 sheep in 1888. A new dip of lime and sulphur was introduced in 1877 and although Holmested complained it left his hands indelibly stained and sore, it was very effective. Shallow Bay is 12 miles from Hill Cove which enabled the two young families to develop without friction despite differences in temperament between the two farmers which was reflected in the upbringing of the children. The Holmesteds had three children, Herbert Stirling, (b1878), Mary Malvina (b1881) and Caroline Adelaide Edith, (b1893). Holmested returned to England in 1889 through ill health, settled in Bedford and died there in 1916.</p><p><a href=\"/biographies/terriss_william\">See Image 340</a></p>",

William Hooker stood then at the threshold of a botanical career which would lead to a professorship at Glasgow and the directorship of the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew. He encouraged Joseph Hooker's latent interests in natural history but Joseph was indebted to both parents for his artistic talent. After attending the grammar school in Glasgow for three years, he and his brother were privately educated at home.</p><p><strong>The Ross Expedition</strong></p><p>In 1838 his father met James Clark <a href=\"/biographies/ross_sir\">ROSS</a> who was organising an expedition to establish the exact location of the magnetic South Pole while concurrently engaging in other scientific research and exploration. Ross agreed to William Hooker's proposal that his son Joseph might be enlisted as a naturalist provided he first qualified as a doctor and entered the medical service of the Royal Navy. Joseph, already a student at Glasgow University, gained his MD in 1839 and Ross accepted him as an assistant surgeon on HMS  <em>Erebus </em>. The ship's senior surgeon would undertake any zoological investigations and delegate botanical research to Hooker. A similar demarcation of duties prevailed in the sister ship HMS  <em>Terror </em>. The official journal which Hooker maintained and his extensive correspondence with his family and friends are the primary source of information about a voyage which lasted four years.</p><p>The two ships sailed on 30 September 1839 via Tenerife, the Cape Verde Archipelago and St Helena for Cape Town where the first magnetic observatory was established. Wherever the ships stopped Hooker collected and recorded the local flora. Kerguelen's Land {Iles Keguelen} introduced him to sub-Antarctic vegetation, mainly mosses and lichens and some flowering plants. He botanised intensively during a three month stay in Van Diemen's Land {Tasmania} where another magnetic observatory (Rossbank) was erected. 'My collections I think improve as I go on, at least the collecting comes with greater facility to me,' he told his father on 9 November 1840. He was surprised to discover tree ferns as far south as the Lord Auckland Islands. In January 1841 the ships passed the farthest point south reached by Captain <a href=\"/biographies/cook_james\">COOK</a> in 1774. A party landed briefly on Possession Island off Victoria Land, an active volcano on Ross Island was named Mount Erebus, and the ships traced the formidable wall of towering ice ('The Great Ice Barrier' now known as the Ross Ice Shelf) for several hundred miles. Deteriorating weather and approaching winter forced a retreat to Tasmania. After a second visit to Sydney in New South Wales the expedition anchored in the Bay of Islands in New Zealand in August 1841. On his second survey of Antarctica Ross returned to the Great Ice Barrier, this time following a more easterly course, always apprehensive of the encircling pack ice. When his crews believed they had seen the last of the icebergs, one loomed up out of the darkness causing the ships to collide. After emergency repairs and 135 days at sea,  <em>Erebus </em>and  <em>Terror </em>sailed into Berkeley Sound in the Falkland Islands on 6 April 1842.</p><p><strong>The Falkland Islands</strong></p><p>Hooker's first impressions were unfavourable. Charles <a href=\"/biographies/darwin_charles\">DARWIN</a> before him had described the landscape having 'a desolate and wretched aspect' and Hooker thought that bleak and stormy Kerguelen's Land was 'a paradise to it. Desolation stares in our faces'. His official journal recorded that the 'land seen in the morning was low but hilly with many white quartz cliffs but little broken land except towards the hill tops'. In the late afternoon the ships anchored off Government House, a low whitewashed building on a hillside close to the water. Nearby was a settlement of about a dozen 'very miserable-looking' houses, no more than 'very poor, mud or stone huts'. He thought better of the two storey wooden dwelling belonging to JB <a href=\"/biographies/whitington_john\">WHITINGTON</a>, the resident storekeeper. They were welcomed by the governor Lieutenant Richard <a href=\"/biographies/moody_richard\">MOODY</a> of the Royal Engineers who had taken up his appointment that January with twelve sappers and miners and three of their wives. He hospitably offered Ross the loan of horses and dogs and made his 'excellent library' available to Hooker, who judged him:</p><blockquote><blockquote>A very active and intelligent young man most anxious to improve the colony and gain every information respecting its products, so he has engaged me on the Botany and more especially on the grasses of the soil for he finds that his fodder grass will not make good hay; nor will the sedge do for thatching, or will either do for a lawn. As you may suppose I am very proud in being useful to him. I have found an excellent Triticum for thatching in the rocky coast and also some Poa and Agrostides for sheep &amp; lawns which he will try to make useful. (Letter to Aunt Palgrave, 25 April 1842.)</blockquote></blockquote><p>Hooker was not the first botanist to survey the Falklands. When Comte de <a href=\"/biographies/bougainville_louis\">BOUGAINVILLE</a> brought the French settlers in 1764, his chaplain and amateur botanist, Antoine Joseph <a href=\"/biographies/pernetty_antoine-joseph\">PERNETTY</a> botanised in East Falkland. He is not known to have collected any specimens although he mentioned some by their colloquial names in his account of the voyage published in 1770. Ross erected a magnetic observatory in the old French fort built by Bougainville. The first collection was probably made by L Née, a botanist on Captain <a href=\"/biographies/malaspina_alejandro\">MALASPINA</a>'s expedition at Port Egmont in West Falkland in December 1789 and January 1794. In 1820 a frigate  <em>L'Uranie </em>belonging to a French scientific expedition was wrecked on the Falklands. All that Hooker found of it were a few fragments of wood and 'some copper and a few iron water casks'. However its botanist, C Gaudichaud-Beaupré, succeeded in salvaging his collection of dried plants of which 128 species had been gathered in the Falklands. He presented a memoir entitled  <em>Flore des Iles Malouines  </em>to the French Academy of Sciences in 1825. The following year another flora with the same title appeared in the  <em>Memoires de la Société Linnéenne </em>. Its author J. <a href=\"/biographies/dumont_durville\">DUMONT D'URVILLE</a>, Captain of the  <em>Coquille </em>had anchored in the Falklands in November 1822. Just over a decade later Charles Darwin on HMS  <em>Beagle </em>made a token collection of plants. A Mr Wright who had returned from 'a mercantile voyage to the Falkland Islands' presented Sir William Hooker in 1841 with a beautiful collection of plants. Sir William was intrigued by Wright's descriptions and drawings of tussock grass and densely tufted cushion plants compared by Wright to 'small haystacks'. He wrote to his son still serving on  <em>Erebus </em>: 'How much I wished I could have reached you with letters at the Falkland Islands. I would like you to investigate the botany &amp; zoology of those islands to the utmost of your power' (20 March 1842).</p><p>Despite the onset of winter with snow and heavy frost Hooker found more flowering plants than he had expected. He conjectured that the absence of tree cover was due to the low rounded hills with their broad shallow-bottomed valleys providing no protection from prevailing winds. He climbed Mounts Vernet and Lowe, crossed the sand hills between Ports William and Jackson (now Stanley Harbour), and reached the beaches at low tide. He notes the 'streams of stones' in the valley bottoms which every traveller since Pernetty had also observed. (Darwin wrote at length about them.)</p><p>He admired 'the pride of the Falklands'  <em>Oxalis enneaphylla </em>(Scurvy Grass), covering the banks at Berkeley Sound 'with a mantle of snowy white' during the spring month of November. He saw this plant only in the Falklands, whereas  <em>Calceolaria fothergillii </em>, (Lady's Slipper),  <em>Viola maculata,  </em>(Yellow Violet), <em> </em>and <em>Hebe elleptica,  </em>(Native Boxwood), were also widespread in Tierra del Fuego off South America. A celery growing along the shoreline,  <em>Apium australe </em>, (Wild Celery), was enjoyed as a vegetable by Ross's men. The natural spinach, a species of  <em>Atriplex </em>, was another culinary favourite. The settlers and especially the gauchos used  <em>Myrtus mummularia,  </em>(Teaberry), as a substitute for tea.</p><p>The sands and peaty soils of the Falklands are colonised by many grass species. Tussock grass,  <em>(Poa flabellate) </em>, excited the attention of Governor Moody when he perceived its potential not only as fodder but also as an agricultural crop on the poor soils on the west coast of Ireland and on the Hebrides. He offered for renting or purchase 300 acre plots on small islands covered with this grass. He grew it himself in an experimental garden and infected Hooker with his enthusiasm. It was, Joseph Hooker told his father, 'the gold and glory of the Falklands and will yet I hope make the future of Orkney and the owners of the Irish peat-bogs.' The wild cattle and horses liked it so much, he told his sister, that they would eat dry tussock thatch from the roofs of houses in preference to other grasses. Vast tracts of the Falklands were covered with its gigantic hemispherical hillocks up to five or six feet high. Each clump supported about 200-300 blades of grass and the spaces between each community of clumps Hooker likened to a 'labyrinth'. Pernety and Gaudichaud had inevitably called attention to it, but Hooker was the first to describe it with botanical precision. It featured prominently in the report that Moody prepared for the Colonial Office recommending that it should be brought to the attention of botanists in the Linnean Society of London.</p><p>Equally striking in the landscape was the balsam-bog ( <em>Bolax gummifera </em>), the 'misery balls' of the settlers. Two to three feet high and pale or yellowish green in colour, these balls reminded Sir William Hooker of 'gigantic pin-cushions' when he saw a sketch of fields full of them. Joseph Hooker also found tussock and balsam-bog in Tierra del Fuego, but never so luxuriant as those in the Falklands. Where there were no flowering plants to collect, Hooker concentrated on cryptogams - mosses, lichens and oceanic algae. 'Sea weeds abound prodigiously in the outer rocky coasts, nor did we elsewhere see such enormous masses of marine vegetation as were cast upon the beach of the east shore of the Falklands' (JC Ross:  <em>A Voyage...)  </em>Hooker was pleased to write to his father in May that:</p><blockquote><blockquote>every day adds something new to my collection, especially among the lower tribes...Altogether this place is better for botany than I had expected and but for lichens etc. it beats Kerguelen's Land [but] collecting here is no sinecure for the days are very short and the nights long.</blockquote></blockquote><p>Four months later he claimed triumphantly that he had found all but three or four of the plants listed by Gaudichaud and was confident that little else had escaped his meticulous searching.</p><p>Among the European plants deliberately or accidentally introduced to the Islands, Hooker recognised chickweed, shepherd's purse, dock and  <em>Poa annua </em>. Dutch clover formed a rich pasture near Government House where sheep contentedly grazed. French settlers had brought livestock with them, rabbits, cattle and horses, which now thrived in vast numbers. Over the years they had scarred the landscape with tracks leading to their favourite feeding grounds in the tussock grass. The day after  <em>Erebus  </em>had arrived Hooker joined a hunting party to kill some cattle for fresh meat for the crew. Gauchos, one of whom was an Englishman, lassoed and slaughtered them. His journal describes the excitement of the chase and the kill:</p><blockquote><blockquote>...the dogs soon caught one cow by the nose and tongue whilst a third held him [sic] by the tail till a man came, hammering him and with two strokes of the knife plunged it into its throat, kicked the dogs off who commenced licking the blood and gave chase to the rest of the herd.</blockquote></blockquote><p>This brief extract conveys the flavour of Hooker's narrative skills. Ross's account of the voyage has a much longer account of a wild cattle hunt 'furnished to me by an officer who accompanied the party' without disclosing his name. Darwin who suspected that it had been written by Hooker could not understand why the contribution was anonymous. Hooker's informative correspondence and his  <em>Himalayan Journals </em>(1854) confirm his literary ability and there can be little doubt that he was its author. Perhaps he modestly requested Ross not to reveal his identity.</p><p>In June 1843 the Colonial Office printed Moody's report and in 1842 the <em>Journal of the Geographical Society  </em>published Sir William Hooker's enthusiastic letter on tussock grass. Sir William also extolled it at some length in his  <em>London Journal of Botany </em>(1843) which he reprinted as  <em>Notes on the Botany of the Antarctic Voyage ... with observations on the tussock grass of the Falkland Islands  </em>(1843). He reported that 'Kew Gardens had been overwhelmed with applications from the proprietors of sandy and peaty soils throughout the British Dominions'. A Wardian case of living plants which included this coveted grass had been despatched from the Falklands but unfortunately none had survived the long sea voyage.  <em>The Gardener's Chronicle </em>(4 March 1843) confirmed its hardiness on non-productive soils and the Royal Agricultural Society presented Moody with a gold medal for his efforts in promoting an awareness of tussock grass. Eventually Kew Gardens propagated it but its seeds frequently failed to germinate. When at last it was established in the Hebrides and Orkneys it grew too slowly to be considered a viable economic crop. Joseph Hooker suggested other Falklands plants that might be useful in agriculture and medicine, but nothing came of his recommendations. However he did compile the first comprehensive survey of the Islands' vegetation in  <em>Flora Antarctica </em>(1844-7). He also contributed a succinct botanical résumé to the second volume of Ross's narrative of this epic voyage.</p><p>On 8 September the ships sailed to Tierra del Fuego, an archipelago off the southernmost extremity of South America. At Hermite Island the two crews saw their first trees since leaving New Zealand. Hooker harvested an abundance of plants in a region he rated 'the greatest botanical centre of the Antarctic Ocean'. They were stored on both ships together with about 800 deciduous and evergreen beeches for planting in the treeless Falklands. The cargo also included tree trunks for roofing the houses there. On 14 November this botanical bounty was unloaded at Berkeley Sound. Much later Hooker learnt that not a single plant from Hermite Island had withstood the climate, the neglect of the settlers or the voracious appetite of the goats. The ships were then overhauled in preparation for the third sortie to Antarctica. Provisioned with some calves, sheep and pigs with tussock grass for fodder to ensure a supply of fresh meat they left the Falklands on 17 December 1842. After enduring exceptionally thick fog, gales, blizzards, spray that froze to the riggings and decks, constantly alert to drifting icebergs, Ross reluctantly decided to end the expedition. The  <em>Erebus </em>and  <em>Terror </em>reached Folkestone on 4 September 1843.</p><p><strong>Back in England</strong></p><p>Hooker rejoined his family at Kew Gardens where his father was now director. The Admiralty retained him as an assistant surgeon with an additional allowance in order to write his account of the botany of the Antarctic voyage. The first two volumes entitled  <em>Flora Antarctica </em>appeared in ten parts between 1844 and 1847. Hooker engaged specialists to enumerate the cryptogams and wrote at length about some of his more spectacular finds which included the tussock grass. This work established his reputation as a taxonomist and as a promising plant geographer, although he later confessed that the  <em>Flora Antarctica </em>'nearly broke my back'. Charles Darwin who congratulated him became an intimate friend, the two men frequently exchanging information and ideas with Hooker acting as a critical sounding board for Darwin's emerging theories on the variability of species.</p><p><strong>The Himalayas</strong></p><p>In 1847 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society. The Admiralty sanctioned a trip to India on half pay, initially for two years to which another year was subsequently added. His father was able to enhance his pay by getting approval for his son to collect plants for Kew. He left England in November 1847 and explored eastern Nepal and Sikkim whose flora was little known. He surveyed and mapped the country as well as collecting plants. Roads and paths where they existed were poor; he was frustrated by suspicious villagers and briefly imprisoned by the Rajah's men. He sent both seeds and dried specimens of rhododendrons to his father who described some of the more decorative species in  <em>Rhododendrons of Sikkim-Himalaya </em>(1849-51). New species of primulas and  <em>Meconopsis </em>dominated the alpines, which he introduced to British gardens. He was reminded of the Falklands streams of stones when he encountered similar phenomena in Sikkim. His  <em>Himalayan Journals </em>(1854) is now a minor classic of travel literature. If Hooker had excluded its botanical content, Darwin declared that the book would still have been 'a very remarkable undertaking for its geology, meteorology, zoology and geography'. The same eclecticism distinguished his personal letters and official journal written during the Antarctic voyage: a curiosity about other cultures, a nodding acquaintance with zoology and more than an amateur's knowledge of birds. Although he had vowed never to embark again on a major flora, he joined forces with Thomas Thomas to compile one of India.  <em>Flora Indica  </em>(1855) never got beyond the first volume, but it laid the foundation for his  <em>Flora of British India </em>(1872-97) in seven volumes.</p><p>On his return to England in 1852 he married Frances Harriet Henslow whose father was Professor of Botany at Cambridge. In 1855 he was appointed Deputy to his father at Kew Gardens, succeeding him as Director ten years later. In 1858 he and the geologist Charles Lyell arranged a meeting at the Linnean Society of London where papers by Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace on evolution and natural selection were read. He vigorously defended Darwin's theory at the celebrated debate in Oxford in 1860. A brief visit to the eastern Mediterranean in the autumn of 1860, a collecting expedition to Morocco in 1871 and a leisurely tour in the USA in 1877 completed his overseas travels. Just before he left for America he was gazetted a Knight Commander of the Star of India for his services to India.</p><p>When he was in the Falklands he told the botanist George Bentham that the 'geography of plants is a favourite subject with me'. He had noted that two plant families that particularly interested Bentham - Labiatae and Leguminosae <em> </em>- were not represented by any species in the sub-Antarctic islands or in the Falklands or Tierra del Fuego. He was also surprised to encounter European species in the southern hemisphere. The similarity of Tierra del Fuego's flora to that of isolated islands thousands of miles to the east intrigued him. Could ocean currents and prevailing winds have dispersed these plants, or had there once been land links now submerged? His  <em>Flora Antarctica </em>subscribed to the proposition that these Antarctic islands might be the summits of a former mountain chain and that their flora were the vestiges of the vegetation of this sunken land mass. In 1883 the Royal Geographical Society awarded him its Royal Medal for his 'long continued researches in botanical geography'. His wife died in November 1874 and in August 1876 he married Hyacinth Jardine, widow of Sir William Jardine, Bart. Hooker had seven children by his first wife and was to have two more by his second.</p><p><strong>Last years</strong></p><p>In 1885 he retired from his post as Director at Kew. With the completion of the multi-volumed  <em>Flora of British India </em>in 1897, he was advanced to Knight Grand Commander of the Star of India and the Linnean Society struck a special gold medal in recognition of his services to botany over sixty years.</p><p>By then the doyen of polar exploration, he was consulted about preparations for a National Antarctic Expedition under the leadership of Robert Falcon Scott. He recommended the inclusion of an observation balloon to view the terrain beyond the high wall of the great ice barrier. His attention was again being focussed on that part of the world which had launched his career. 'I shall end my active life as I began it, in the interest of Antarctic discovery' he told a friend in 1897. On the eve of his second expedition to the South Pole in May 1910, Captain Scott invited Hooker to hoist the white ensign on his ship  <em>Terra Nova </em>. Hooker's infirmities compelled him to decline an honour 'which would have been the crowning one of my long life could I have accepted it'.</p><p>Almost up to his death at his house in Sunningdale in Berkshire on 11 December 1911, he continued identifying dried specimens of the complex genus  <em>Impatiens </em>. He was buried in the churchyard of St Anne's church on Kew Green next to his father with whom he had enjoyed a special rapport. Unlike his diplomatic and tactful father, he could be impulsive and brusque in manner and he seldom concealed his dislike of bureaucrats, qualities that were not always conducive to smooth administration at Kew. He was loyal to his friends who knew his personal integrity, admired his scholarship and who acknowledged with numerous honours and awards his many achievements. He is remembered on the Falkland Islands by Hooker's Point, a small headland east of Stanley and he was commemorated in a 1985 set of British Antarctic Territory stamps on naturalists.</p><p><a href=\"/biographies/ross_sir\">See Image 293</a></p>",

        "body": " <p>naval officer, was born in Scotland in 1798, the second son of Charles Hope, lord president of the Court of Session in Scotland, and Charlotte, daughter of John, second Earl of Hopetoun. He entered the navy on 24 June 1811 as a second-class volunteer in the  <em>Sarpedon.  </em>After serving as a midshipman in a succession of ships in 1815 he joined the frigate  <em>Alceste </em>, Captain Murray Maxwell, and in her took part in the following year in Lord Amherst's embassy to China. On the voyage home the  <em>Alceste </em>was wrecked in Gaspar Strait (Selat Gaspar, Indonesia) on 18 February 1817: the survivors, including Hope, landed on an island in the strait while one of the boats was sent to Batavia {Jakarta} for assistance. Before being rescued, the survivors had to beat off an attack by Malay pirates. On his return to England, Hope was appointed as lieutenant, on 22 February 1818, to the  <em>Liffey </em>, in which he served in the Mediterranean and off Lisbon. In 1822 he was promoted commander and in February 1824 he was appointed in command of the 10 gun brig-sloop  <em>Brisk </em>. In September of that year he captured a large smuggling lugger off Flamborough Head, with a cargo of considerable value.</p><p>In January 1826, Hope was promoted captain. On 12 September 1826 he married Anne, eldest daughter of Rear Admiral Henry Webly Parry <em> </em>and in October 1830 he was appointed in command of the 28 gun frigate  <em>Tyne </em>on the South American station. Following the attack on Port Louis by Captain <a href=\"/biographies/duncan_silas\">DUNCAN</a> of the USS <em>Lexington,  </em>the Admiralty was ordered to send a ship to Port Egmont in West Falkland to exercise right of sovereignty. In consequence Rear Admiral Sir Thomas Baker ordered the  <em>Clio </em>, Commander JJ <a href=\"/biographies/onslow_john\">ONSLOW</a>, to proceed to the Falklands and at the same time ordered Hope, who was about to sail for Peru with the new British representative, to call at the Falklands en route. Both ships sailed from Río on 20 November 1832. The  <em>Clio </em>entered Berkeley Sound on 2 January 1833, and after the forced departure on Don José María PINEDO and the  <em>Sarandi </em>, <em> </em>returned to Río. <em> </em>The  <em>Tyne  </em>called at Port Egmont on 10 January 1833 and left a placard asserting British ownership. She anchored off Port Louis on 14 January, and sailed again on the 18th. Hope sent Admiral Baker a lengthy report of his visit. He noted that the Islands were worthy of colonisation and recommended the despatch of a detachment of marines.</p><p>Prior to being paid off in January 1834 the  <em>Tyne </em>had covered over 82,000 miles, a greater distance than by any other vessel since the end of the Napoleonic War. Hope subsequently commanded the  <em>Dublin </em>and  <em>Thalia, </em>being employed in the latter frigate between 1841-45 in the East India and Pacific stations, after which he was placed on half-pay. He died on 6 August 1854. His wife had died on 24 December 1836.</p>",

        "body": "<p>botanical artist, born at Tipperary, Ireland on 8 August 1887, daughter of William Howe-Hennis and Elizabeth Charlotte Howe-Hennis, part of a well-respected Protestant family, among them several doctors and army officers. In 1910, at the age of 23, Frances Howe-Hennis came from Ireland as governess for the children of Howard and Mabel Clement at Roy Cove settlement, West Falkland. She travelled on the Pacific Steam Navigation Company's RMS  <em>Oravia </em>from Liverpool to Stanley, arriving on 21 September. She wrote that she would never forget her first impression of the Islands: she was 'expecting something sombre and gloomy' but described her early morning view while the ship passed through the Stanley Narrows, as 'a most picturesque scene'. The atmosphere was clear, the sky a beautiful blue and 'there was no lack of beauty. The ruggedness of the scenery had a charm of its own. It was nature in her wild state, yet beautiful and so free'.</p><p>She left Stanley on the  <em>Ramna </em>, a whaler from the station at New Island and because she could not be taken directly to Roy Cove was 'dumped on a station further down the East Island with the promise of being picked up in a few days'. Frances Howe-Hennis and fellow passengers arrived without invitation 'vaguely wondering how we should be received' but the reception had 'as much warmth and welcome as if we had been long-expected guests'. She felt that West Falkland was 'certainly the place for nature lovers. Here the mountain peaks run in chains, behind which other peaks rise and fade away, and the \"distance lends enchantment to the view\".' She lived at Roy Cove for three and a half years.</p><p>Little would be known about her activities in the Falklands if, on her return to Ireland, she had not written  <em>Reminiscences of a Sojourn in the Falkland Islands </em>. This typed text of about 4,000 words includes her own small sepia photographs on almost every page and there are 53 beautiful coloured plates of Falkland flowering plants and one of a green spider and butterfly. In addition there are four landscapes, three of West Point Island harbour with different vessels (including the cutter  <em>Alice  </em>and the schooner  <em>Gwendoline </em>) and one of Herbert's stream, Roy Cove; two of these are signed 'F.J.H' and one 'F.J. Hennis'. Frances Howe-Hennis had a keen interest in studying natural history, particularly the 'new' plants that she found in the Falklands. Her paintings show that she was also an accomplished watercolourist. The  <em>Reminiscences  </em>with chapters on life in a typical Camp settlement, the Kelpers - clearly showing their reliance on horses, her first Christmas and her visit to West Point Island, are a valuable social history of the Falklands before World War I.</p><p>She wrote about a few flowering plants, including the Pale Maiden 'with its white yet almost transparent cup-shaped blossoms' which she thought was aptly described as the Falkland Snowdrop because it was the first flower seen after winter. Others mentioned were Scurvy Grass, Vanilla Daisy, the berry-bearing Diddle-dee, Teaberry and the Christmas Bush which was used to decorate houses at Christmas time. Letters from the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew show that Frances Howe-Hennis sent a large collection of seaweeds to Kew in July 1914, for examination and naming. She collected plants for her paintings and also sent dried and pressed examples of about 20 species for the herbarium of the Department of Botany at the Natural History Museum (NHM) in London. These include the inconspicuous and now [Critically Endangered] Fuegian Whitlowgrass  <em>Draba magellanica  </em>probably from Roy Cove, one of only three specimens of this plant from the Falklands at the NHM. She sent paintings for identification and the different handwriting used for plant names on her plates suggests that these were passed between specialists in different families of plants.</p><p>Frances Howe-Hennis obviously enjoyed her time at Roy Cove and developed a close relationship with her employer Mabel Clement. In the  <em>Reminiscences </em>on a page below typed text and a photograph, there is a short poem dedicated 'To You (My sister)', handwritten and signed by Mabel in 1917. Frances left Stanley on 16 April 1914 aboard RMS  <em>Oriana </em>, probably reaching her home before the start of World War I. Though she wanted to train as a doctor, funds were not available so she trained as a nurse and sanitary (environmental health) inspector in Dublin. Frances Howe-Hennis worked as a health visitor for 33 parishes in Kent for several years and needed transport. Based on her experience in the Falklands, on appointment she asked if she could have a horse. The senior medical officer thought this was not seemly, so she had to be content with an Austin Seven! It was in Kent that she met an insurance agent, Frank Butler, and they were married on 16 April 1923. According to her son Frank (Barney) (b1926), she did not take photographs nor paint flowering plants again. She died on 19 January 1976 in the London Borough of Enfield.</p><p>The reappearance of  <em>Reminiscences of a Sojourn in the Falkland Islands </em>after 90 years was fortuitous. The text and paintings had been sent to the publisher Tony Nelson and in mid-2001, after discussion with her son, it was agreed that the volume could be taken to the Falklands later that year. The complete text of the  <em>Reminiscences </em>was published in the  <em>Falkland Islands Journal </em>in 2003 and her painting of the Lady's Slipper  <em>Calceolaria fothergillii </em>appeared on the cover of the 2004 edition. Coincidentally, this was soon after research had shown that this flowering plant is endemic to the Falklands. Her paintings of flowers, almost all of native species including endemics, are impressive and also deserve to be published. Her  <em>Reminiscences,  </em>including <em> </em>the paintings and original letters relating to her collections, are now on loan to the Falkland Islands Government Archives in Stanley and available for study.</p>",

        "body": " <p>was probably born in Plymouth around 1734. He entered the navy in 1743 as captain's servant on board the  <em>Argyle </em>. After serving in a number of ships he passed for lieutenant and was promoted to that rank on 2 April 1757. In October 1767, he was promoted to commander and appointed in command of the 16 gun sloop  <em>Tamar  </em>with orders to proceed to Port Egmont in West Falkland and to 'carry into execution all such orders, directed to his predecessor [Captain McBRIDE] as remain unexecuted'. Hunt sailed for the Falklands from Falmouth on 10 November, reaching Port Egmont on 12 February 1768, where he found the 14 gun sloop  <em>Swift </em>, the 8 gun sloop  <em>Carcass </em>and the store-ship  <em>Florida </em>at anchor; the latter two sailing for England on 9 March. On 5 December he set off on a fruitless search for the non-existent Pepys Island, thought to be situated to the north of the Falklands at 47°S. On his return to Port Egmont, on 1 January 1769, he found the  <em>Florida  </em>had returned there on 26 December, followed by the 14 gun sloop  <em>Favourite </em>on 2 February. This allowed the  <em>Swift </em>and <em>Florida  </em>to sail for England <em> </em>on 7 February. Hunt remained in Port Egmont until 27 November when he set off on a cruise to the east, encountering the following day 2 miles north of Cape Tamar the Spanish schooner  <em>San Felipe </em>on a surveying cruise from the Spanish settlement of Puerto de la Soledad, in Berkeley Sound. The two anchored in White Rock Bay, where Hunt informed the schooner's captain that the Falklands belonged to the British crown and ordered him to leave the Islands. The schooner sailed the next day for Puerto de la Soledad, while Hunt visited San Carlos Water before returning to White Rock Bay on 9 December. The following day the  <em>San Felipe </em>also anchored in the bay with Mario Plata, an infantry lieutenant on board, bringing a present and two letters from Felipe Ruiz <a href=\"/biographies/ruiz_puente\">PUENTE</a>, commandant of the Spanish settlement. In a courteous but formal letter Ruiz Puente assumed that Hunt's presence in the islands was accidental and that he would depart immediately. Hunt replied on the same day, informing Ruiz Puente that the islands belonged to the British crown and giving him six months to abandon his settlement. The  <em>San Felipe </em>got under way the following morning, presumably to return to Puerto de la Soledad to deliver Hunt's reply, while Hunt returned to Port Egmont on 15 December, where the  <em>Favourite  </em>was at anchor <em>.  </em>On 18 December the  <em>San Felipe </em>entered Port Egmont and was met by two armed boats and forced to anchor. Plata delivered his own protest at this and not being allowed to land. The schooner left the following day, probably to continue to Buenos Aires to report to Governor Francisco BUCARELI. On 25 January 1770 the <em>Swift </em>, commanded by George <a href=\"/biographies/farmer_george\">FARMER</a>, arrived from Plymouth and on 1 February the  <em>Florida </em>returned once more to Port Egmont. On 9 February two strange ships were seen in the offing and on 20 February the Spanish frigates  <em>Santa Catalina </em>, commanded by Fernando Rubalcava and the  <em>Andalucía </em>, commanded by Domingo Perletto, with troops bound for Puerto de la Soledad, entered the harbour, finding there the  <em>Tamar, Favourite, Swift </em>and  <em>Florida.  </em>Faced with this unexpected show of strength Rubalcava made a modest request for water, which Hunt duly supplied. The Spanish frigates remained in Port Egmont for eight days, without attempting to go ashore, although Hunt invited the captains and officers to do so. Rubalcava, however, sent a letter of protest at finding a settlement flying the English flag. Hunt replied the same day that the Islands belonged to England and that he meant to protect them to the utmost of his power and urged the Spanish to evacuate them. On the last day of February the Spanish frigates withdrew to confer with Bucareli in Buenos Aires. The arrival of the  <em>Swift </em>allowed Hunt to sail for England on 7 March with the storeship  <em>Florida </em>, leaving Farmer in command at Port Egmont. Hunt reached Plymouth on 3 May 1770, when he reported the Spanish presence in the islands to the Admiralty, forwarding the correspondence that had ensued.</p><p>Subsequently Hunt was promoted to captain on 10 January 1771 and in 1776 he took part in the attack on Charleston, (South Carolina) in command of the 20 gun corvette  <em>Sphinx </em>. On 19 April 1780 he was appointed to the 70 gun ship  <em>Diligente </em>, but he was relieved on 24 April 1780, possibly on his appointment as second captain of Greenwich Hospital, where he died on 3 December 1795.</p>",

        "body": "<p>governor, was born on 29 June, 1926 in Redcar, Yorkshire, the son of Henry William Hunt and Ivy, née Masterman. He was educated at Sir William Turner's School, Coatham and St Peter's College, Oxford. On 22 September 1951 he married Mavis Amanda, daughter of George Albert Buckland, MM, of Chingford, Essex, and May, née Ferne. They have two children, Diana Mollie Amanda (b1962) and Antony Paul Masterman (b1964).</p><p>Hunt joined the Royal Air Force as soon as he was old enough in 1944. He served as a fighter pilot on No 5 Squadron in India and on No 26 Squadron in Germany in 1948, when he left the RAF and returned to Oxford to complete his law degree. He joined the Overseas Civil Service in 1951 and served in Uganda as a district commissioner until 1963, when he joined the Commonwealth Relations Office and was posted as first secretary in Kuching (Sarawak), which by then was part of Malaysia. He was there from 1964-65, then to Jesselton (Sabah) 1965-67 and Brunei 1967. He was next posted to Ankara (Turkey) as first secretary (commercial) from 1968-70. From 1970 to 1972 he was first secretary and head of chancery at Jakarta {Indonesia} followed by a spell in Middle East Department, FCO from 1972 to 1974. He was then posted as counsellor, Saigon from 1974 to 1975, when the North Vietnamese took over and the British Embassy had to be closed down. He then went as counsellor to Kuala Lumpur, 1976-77, before being promoted to deputy high commissioner 1977-79.</p><p>Early in 1980, Hunt was made governor and commander-in-chief, Falkland Islands and high commissioner, British Antarctic Territory. He was awarded the CMG.</p><p>In Hunt's previous experience, a British colony always had an experienced triumvirate of chief secretary, financial secretary and attorney general. These were the three sides of the pyramid which supported the governor. Hunt had an excellent chief secretary in Dick <a href=\"/biographies/baker_frances\">BAKER</a> and a remarkable financial secretary in Falkland Islander Harold <a href=\"/biographies/rowlands_harold\">ROWLANDS</a>; but no attorney general. The Overseas Development Administration took a long time to produce one.</p><p>The year 1980 was an important milestone in Falkland Islands' history. The Falkland Islands Company agreed to sell one of its farms on favourable terms to the Falkland Islands Government, which in turn offered soft loans to six selected Falkland Islanders to buy their own farms. Hunt was delighted to present the title deeds to the new owners. Green Patch was split up into six subdivisions, roughly 15,000 acres and 3,000 sheep apiece. The joy on the faces of the young farmers and their families told clearly what it meant to them. For the first time, they had a stake in their own land. At last Lord SHACKLETON's recommendation to transfer farm ownership to local owner-occupiers had begun.</p><p>Another important recommendation of Shackleton's report was to develop a Fisheries Conservation Zone and licensing system. Hunt had been pressing for this since his arrival, but FCO's reply was always 'too provocative'. They could hardly continue to say that after Galtieri's invasion without provocation, but it was not until 1986 that a Fisheries Zone was declared and licences issued.</p><p>In the first year, 215 licences were issued to fishing vessels and during the first two years, the FIG's revenue jumped from £6 million to £22 million. The main catch came from squid, both Illex and Loligo, names that are now as common in the Falklands as wether and hogget. Councillors were naturally delighted at the high revenue received, but their financial secretary kept a steady hand and as a result the income from reserve funds is second only to the revenue from the fisheries.</p><p>Going back to 1981, the FCO minister in charge of the Falkland Islands, Nicholas <a href=\"/biographies/ridley_nicholas\">RIDLEY</a>, had brought out what he called a simple message for the Islanders: 'The \"dead hand\" of the sovereignty dispute was stagnating the Islands' economy. It was therefore in the Islanders' interest to resolve the dispute'.</p><p>Subsequent history has shown that it was not the 'dead hand' of the sovereignty dispute that stagnated the Islands' economy, but the 'dead hand' of Whitehall. Lord Shackleton told Hunt in 1982 how disappointed he was that virtually none of his team's 1977 recommendations had been implemented. That was why the economy was in serious decline. Fortunately for the Falkland Islanders, Lord Shackleton was invited during the 1982 conflict by the Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, to update his report, which he did by September 1982.</p><p>Galtieri's folly changed the lives of the Falkland Islanders completely. Until 2 April 1982, few British people either knew where the Falkland Islands were or had the slightest interest in them. The FCO had been trying since 1968 to win over hostile local opinion on closer ties with Argentina, 'leading gradually but inexorably to the acceptance of Argentine sovereignty'. This was the assessment of the Falklands by Lord <a href=\"/biographies/chalfont_alun\">CHALFONT</a> in 1968. He spent six days in the Islands: Hunt spent almost six years there.</p><p>After Galtieri's folly in 1982, Hunt was no longer governor and commander-in-chief, but civil commissioner. The military function was separated from the civil, and left to the military commissioner. Hunt explained on the Falklands Islands Broadcasting Service the reasoning behind his change of title. It was based on the sound practical reason that with five or six thousand troops and a major general in charge of all the British forces on the Falkland Islands, the governor was greatly relieved to have his military responsibilities removed. Hunt was appointed a Knight Bachelor in 1982.</p><p>Hunt lost no time in establishing a joint civil and military Rehabilitation Committee, with the aim of restoring the Falkland Islands to normality as soon as possible. By 1985, the Islanders and their councillors had won their wish to go back to governor rather than civil and military commissioners. This was agreed by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Ministry of Defence.</p><p>Since retirement from the Diplomatic Service he has made six visits to the Falkland Islands and each time he has become even more confident that, regardless of Argentina's continuing claim, the Islanders have the firm belief that they can and will be masters of their own destiny.</p>",

He left Southampton for Montevideo on 9 March 1860 to work for the South American Mission Society (SAMS). Leaving Montevideo on 17 June, he arrived at Stanley on 29 June; finally he reached Keppel Island on 29 July. A year later he and Theophilus Fredric Schmid started work in Patagonia, arriving at Punta Arenas on 9 June 1861. They worked at first among the Indians near the Strait of Magellan, later wandering about Patagonia with them. At the end of May 1862 they settled in Santa Cruz. The mission was not a success: Schmid went mad and there were problems with the Indians and liquor. When the Rev Waite <a href=\"/biographies/stirling_waite\">STIRLING</a> met him at the beginning of 1863, Hunziker was not in good health. He transferred to Carmen de Patagones in the first quarter of 1864.</p><p>Hunziker married Martha Ellen Felton (eldest daughter of Henry <a href=\"/biographies/felton_henry\">FELTON)</a> in Stanley on 21 July 1864, and they returned to Carmen de Patagones on 8 August. Back in Stanley, they had a son, James, in November 1866 who died at 13 days old. They returned to Keppel Island, where James is buried. During 1867 Hunziker left the employ of SAMS and probably worked at first at the Albemarle Dairy before moving to Port Stephens as a cowman for GM <a href=\"/biographies/dean_john1\">DEAN</a>, subsequently becoming the flockmaster and then the first farm manager. Another son, Frederick, was born in February 1868. Other children were Charles (b1870), James Herbert (b1874), Arthur (b1875) and Eleanor (b1879). Martha, his wife, died at Port Stephens in March 1881 and was buried there. Sometime afterwards he married for the second time, Madeline (youngest daughter of Henry Felton) and they had a daughter, Nellie, in 1884. Another daughter Ada was born in 1885 and a son, Walter John in 1886. In 1886 the family moved to Minnesota, where they had three further children: Stanley (b1889) Nora (b1890) and Oscar (b1893). Hunziker died in the USA in 1907.</p><p>'Seemingly a good fellow', noted Captain <a href=\"/biographies/wiseman_william\">WISEMAN</a> who called by in 1882, although the tradition at Port Stephens is that he was better at managing his flock of Indian converts than he was at herding the Falklands sheep. He is remembered at Port Stephens by 'Hunziker's Leap' a chasm running back from the sea about 200 feet deep. Hunziker once jumped over this on horseback while chasing colts, though only at a point where it is about five foot wide.</p>",

        "body": "<p>FIC director, MP and baron, was born on 2 May 1901, the third son of Percy and Hannah Hurd. His father was MP for Frome 1918-23 and Devizes 1924-45. His two elder brothers were killed in the Great War. Antony was educated at Marlborough and Pembroke College, Cambridge and then took the tenancy of Rainscombe Farm near Marlborough, Wiltshire, which he farmed until 1947. In 1928 he married Stephanie, daughter of Edred Corner, a successful London surgeon, by whom he had three sons. Hurd represented Newbury in the House of Commons from 1945 to 1964 and for many years served as chairman of the Conservative Parliamentary Agricultural Committee. For fifteen years until 1958 he was agricultural correspondent of the <em>Times </em>.</p><p>From 1953 to 1966 Hurd was a director of the Falkland Islands Company. He and his wife developed an enthusiastic affection for the Islands, which they visited in 1956, 1958, 1962 and 1965. These were not brief stopovers; each lasted three or four weeks, depending on the schedules of the SS <em>Fitzroy </em>(1956) or <em>Darwin  </em>(1958, 1962, 1965), which carried them to and from Montevideo.</p><p>Hurd's letters and his wife's letters and diaries give a vivid picture of Island life at this period. His approach was that of a farmer not a tourist. With his wife he visited and revisited the Company's settlements, in all parts of the Islands, and made friends with its scattered shepherds and managers and their wives. They travelled by boat, helicopter and by Land Rover along the uneven tracks, often bogged down, once stranded for four and a half hours between Fitzroy and Darwin. 'The roads are full of potholes', Hurd wrote, 'and the water looks like whisky and to strangers has a peculiar taste and effect'. They listened carefully to the life stories of the Company's employees. Young men out on contract were paid on a credit system, and could expect to save £500, or even £1000 after five years. They inspected the Company's new school at Darwin with room for 40 boarders, and other Company projects such as a mink farm and a large peat-cutting machine.</p><p>Hurd, who had at one stage declined the governorship himself, usually stayed one or two nights on these visits at Government House, despite the fact that Government House then had no guest room big enough for two people. He and his wife got on well with successive governors, though he felt that they should serve for longer, and that more power should be devolved to the LegCo. He was scornful of the big Whitehall-financed project for a meat freezing works at Ajax Bay which had failed around 1954. He urged that the taxpayer's money (£2 to 3 million) should be spent on a system of all-weather roads. He was not happy either with some of the Company's own policies; there were heavy sheep losses and the lambing ratio of the Romney ewes was only 65%. Having visited smaller owner-run farms he concluded that the problem was malnutrition, and the answer a grassland improvement scheme initially covering 6,000 acres, bringing clover and grass varieties such as Yorkshire Fog from the United Kingdom.</p><p>So far as he was concerned the Argentine claim to the islands was ridiculous and irrelevant to the actual life of the Islanders. He was created a life peer (Baron Hurd of Newbury) in 1964, and died of a heart attack on holiday in Antigua on 12 February 1966. After his death his wife sustained their deep affection for the Falkland Islands and entertained many Islanders at her home in Wiltshire.</p><p>Anthony Hurd's eldest son Douglas visited the Islands as foreign secretary in 1994 and is president of the Falkland Islands Association in London. He has presented his mother's diary and letters from the Islands to the Museum at Stanley.</p><p><a href=\"/biographies/barton_arthur\">See Image 22</a></p>",

He was privately educated and joined the Royal Dublin Fusiliers from Sandhurst in 1916. He was wounded in the Battle of the Somme. Transferred to the Gloucestershire Regiment in 1922, he served in India and Singapore in the 1930s before becoming colonel of the 8th Battalion of the King's Regiment (the Liverpool Irish).</p><p>From May 1942 to March 1944 he commanded the Falkland Islands Force of 2000 men, arriving in Stanley on 6 July: 'came to Port William', he wrote, 'am much reminded of the Shannon estuary'. During his time in the Islands he and his men built the defences, established a network of communications and trained the FIDF. He also established an excellent working relationship with Governor <a href=\"/biographies/cardinall_sir\">CARDINALL</a>, and with the people of the Islands, whom he held in high regard. On one occasion he set sail in the <em>Fitzroy </em>for South Georgia, because the Argentine navy were placing Argentine flags there (made of tin, because of the high winds). The Argentines withdrew and their flags were replaced with Union Jacks.</p><p>At a ceremonial parade in Stanley on 15 January 1944, the governor told the British forces: 'You have re-forged and strengthened the already strong link that has always bound the Falklands to the Motherland'. Hynes' Farewell Order of the Day, two weeks later, read:</p><blockquote><blockquote>On leaving the Falkland Islands I say farewell with sincere regret to the Falkland Islands Defence Force. I was very privileged to have it included in the force under my command here, and was very impressed with the keenness and zeal with which all ranks carried out their duties and by their unfailing endurance and good humour under any conditions...This is the furthest distant British Colony in the Empire and I am proud of our association together.</blockquote></blockquote><p>On his return to Europe, Hynes was soon involved with the allied forces after D-Day, being based in Belgium where he ran the lines of supply. After the war, he was liaison officer in Germany between the Control Commission and the Emergency Economic Commission for Europe, later the Economic Commission for Europe. He was awarded the OBE in 1944 and advanced to CBE in 1946. He was also mentioned in despatches (9 August 1945) and received the US Legion of Merit in 1947. He retired as Brigadier in 1952 and was active in charitable work and always keenly involved with anything to do with the Falkland Islands.</p><p>In 1928 Hynes married Ruth Kathleen Taylor: they had two daughters: Jane Margaret (b1930) and Diana Mary (b1932). Diana married Barney Miller, an American resident of Argentina and in 1994 he visited Stanley to deliver Hynes' photograph album and other Falklands memorabilia to the Museum. Hynes died of a heart failure at Wisborough Green in Sussex on 5 March 1972. His wife died on 27 September 1986.</p>",

        "body": "<p>naval officer and privateer, was born in North Parish, New London, Conn, on 17 June 1772. His signature is always David Jewett, but in a couple of signatures, written flamboyantly, it can be misread as Daniel. Also, on just two documents out of many others in his Argentine archive file, his surname looks like Jewitt. This is probably how the incorrect version of his name, Daniel Jewitt, came about. Unfortunately Louis <a href=\"/biographies/vernet_louis\">VERNET</a> always refers to him as this, in far better known documents written years later. This has misled historians ever since. His true name is David Jewett.</p><p>Jewett studied law for a time, but then joined the United States Navy. Commissioned a captain in 1791, he seems to have taken part in the undeclared naval war between the United States and France in 1799-1801 and to have been a successful privateer in the War of 1812-1814*.</p><p>In mid-1815 he made his way to South America, where chaos reigned as the Spanish colonies fought, first for independence from Spain and then against each other. Jewett took to Buenos Aires his own ship, the  <em>Invincible </em>, a 440 ton, 40 gun frigate with a crew of 180, and offered his services to the United Provinces of the River Plate. On 23 June 1815 he was granted a 'letter of marque'* by the United Provinces to prey on Spanish shipping, with the proviso that Spanish property found under the flags of Britain or the United States was to be respected. After a privateering voyage lasting 27 months, during which he captured four Spanish ships, he returned to Buenos Aires in early 1817, and the  <em>Invincible </em>(now spelt  <em>Invencible </em>) was sold. Presumably Jewett pocketed the profits from the sale of the ship as well as some of the prize money.</p><p><strong>The first and last voyage of the  <em>Heroína </em></strong></p><p>At that time Patrick Lynch, a well-established Buenos Aires merchant of Irish origin, was fitting out a privateer at his own expense, eventually named  <em>Heroína </em>. On 15 January 1820, at Lynch's request, Jewett was commissioned as a colonel in the United Provinces navy and placed in command of the  <em>Heroína </em>, which thus became a naval vessel as well as a privateer. It is important to note that Jewett's commission made no mention of the Falklands; his purpose was again to attack the shipping of Spain, with which the United Provinces were still at war. The ship had a crew of 200 men, mostly British or American, with a detachment of 42 Spanish-speaking soldiers.</p><p>In late March 1820 Jewett left the River Plate: the voyage was a disaster. The  <em>Heroína </em>leaked badly, as did the water casks; they had little money, so getting supplies was difficult. They failed to find a single Spanish ship in the entire Atlantic, but on 27 July 1820 they did at last capture a prize, the Portuguese merchantman  <em>Carlota </em>. Jewett put a prize crew on board her and took her crew and passengers aboard the  <em>Heroína.  </em>The two ships then sailed on in company southward. But the United Provinces were not officially at war with Portugal, so capturing the  <em>Carlota </em>was piracy on the high seas, and was condemned as such, not merely by a Portuguese prize court in 1822 but by Jewett's own crew at the time. Many of them, being British, regarded Portugal as an ally and planned to mutiny against Jewett, but he discovered the plot and had four men executed on deck by firing squad. There was another mutiny on the prize ship, which Jewett likewise foiled. The crews of both ships began to be severely affected by scurvy and many died. Then on 20 October the  <em>Carlota </em>was parted from the  <em>Heroina  </em>by a violent gale and foundered with the entire prize crew.</p><p>Having lost the  <em>Carlota </em>, Jewett had to decide what to do. If he returned to Buenos Aires with no prizes and a decimated crew, it would mean the end of his career. He decided to go to the Falklands, which he no doubt regarded as Spanish and therefore fair game, probably in the hope of finding Spanish prizes there. Many accounts, Argentine, British and American, imply that he was commissioned to go there, and Argentine accounts even suggest he was on an official expedition to claim the Falklands. There is no evidence for this. In the first place, no such orders survive, and secondly, he was on a privateering voyage, and had spent seven months hunting for Spanish prizes in the Atlantic before going to the Falklands. If he had captured any prizes, he would have taken them to Buenos Aires rather than to the deserted and distant Falklands. But since he had lost the  <em>Carlota </em>, that constraint did not apply; the Falklands were a place where his crew could recover, but could not desert him, and he might find some Spanish prizes there. The <em>Heroína </em>anchored in Berkeley Sound on 27 October 1820. More men died on shore and both ship and crew were in a parlous state.  In his subsequent report Jewett said:</p><blockquote><blockquote>The state of the Heroina on entering this port cannot be adequately described and scarcely imagined. Only ten effective seamen calculated to do the duty of the ship, to attend the sick, the dying, and to bury the dead - without the most distant hope of relief.</blockquote></blockquote><p>Berkeley Sound was very probably entirely deserted when Jewett arrived. Many accounts state he found it full of ships, but he mentions no other ships in his letters, and although his ship and crew were in dire straits, he received no help at all on the spot. The only ship he managed to contact was the sealing brig  <em>Jane </em>, anchored in Port Salvador north-west of Port Louis. On 2 November Jewett addressed a letter to her captain - her flag told him she was British, but he did not know her captain's name. If there had been any other ships in Berkeley Sound, his men would have had to go past them to take his letter to the  <em>Jane </em>, an absurd proceeding. The  <em>Jane </em>'s captain was James <a href=\"/biographies/weddell_james\">WEDDELL</a>, who walked across to Berkeley Sound to meet Jewett. Weddell, too, mentions no other ships in his account. Weddell helped Jewett move the  <em>Heroína </em>up the Sound to the anchorage off Port Louis and then spent the night on board, where Jewett recounted his voyage.</p><p>Accounts that Jewett found fifty ships in the Falklands, told them to stop fishing (i.e. killing seals), and leave the Islands are completely untrue. They come from a report written by Louis Vernet at the urgent request of Argentine Foreign Minister Manuel Vicente de Maza twelve years later, in 1832, when Argentina was faced with the aftermath of Vernet's own activities, which had led to the Lexington raid and a diplomatic crisis with the Americans. In this report, Vernet confused his own activities with Jewett's - or perhaps deliberately sought to portray his own activities as no more than something done much earlier by Jewett too. Vernet even named fifteen ships as having been at Port Louis when Jewett was there, though some of them are known for certain not to have been there at that time. Vernet's erroneous account has unfortunately become traditional, and has found its way into several accounts of the history of the Falklands.</p><p><strong>Jewett 'takes possession' at Port Louis</strong></p><p>In late 1820 there was a rush of British and American ships to the newly-discovered sealing grounds in the South Shetlands. Many of these ships stopped for water and provisions at the Falklands, mostly around the western islands, but a few went to Port Louis. While they were there, on 6 November 1820, Jewett announced he was 'taking possession' of the Islands for the United Provinces: he read out a declaration to that effect under a Buenos Aires flag and the  <em>Heroína </em>fired a salute. He clearly regarded the islands as Spanish; 'taking possession' of them continued his anti-Spanish activities. Spain, however, had not abandoned her claim to them, and indeed never formally did so. Some Argentine and American accounts imply that Jewett's 'declaration' was witnessed by a large number of people, but there is no evidence for that - James Weddell was there, and the captains of one or more sealing ships, plus no doubt some of Jewett's own crew, but that may well have been all. On 9 November Jewett sent a letter to Captain William Orne of the sealer  <em>General Knox </em>, of Salem, Massachusetts, informing him of the claim, which implies that Orne had not been present at the possession ceremony. The sealing ships then left, including James Weddell in the  <em>Jane </em>; Orne continued sealing around the Falklands for several more months, and on his return to Salem on 5 June 1821 he gave Jewett's letter to the local newspaper, the  <em>Salem Gazette </em>.</p><p>Jewett remained at Port Louis in the  <em>Heroína </em>for almost six months vainly waiting for prizes; Argentine accounts say he 'enforced Argentine sovereignty', but that is wide of the mark. In fact his total inactivity led to a near-mutiny when in January 1820 Laureano Ansoátegui, the commander of the embarked troops, challenged Jewett to return to Buenos Aires, on the grounds that they were 'vegetating' at Port Louis, were in no condition to take any prizes, were doing no good to the crew or shareholders, and had reached the end of the eight-month period of service they had all signed on for. Jewett regarded this as mutiny and relieved Ansoátegui of his command.</p><p><strong>The  <em>Rampart </em></strong></p><p>But not a single Spanish ship appeared at Port Louis; the  <em>Heroína </em>and her crew were in much too poor a state to capture anything, and the men dangerously insubordinate. In the end Jewett decided to resign his commission. Since he had been entirely without contact with Buenos Aires for almost a year, his whereabouts and his decision to resign were unknown to the authorities there. In the absence of Spanish ships, he seized an American schooner, the <em>Rampart </em>, captain Thomas Farrin, at anchor at Port Louis, on the grounds that she was carrying Spanish goods. He sent her to Buenos Aires under a prize crew, carrying his resignation and a long report of his activities to the government in Buenos Aires, dated 1 February 1821. This report, written in English, runs to 13 pages and describes the entire voyage of the  <em>Heroína </em>- but it does not mention any claim to the Falklands! Jewett kept that to himself, perhaps knowing he had exceeded his instructions and probably not wanting to give any advantage to the Buenos Aires government, whose inveterate enemy he later became. The government would never have known about the claim if it had not been reported months later in American and British newspapers.</p><p>The  <em>Rampart </em>arrived in Buenos Aires on 17 March 1821, and from her captain the United Provinces government learnt for the first time that Jewett was in the Falklands (but not that he had claimed the Islands). His seizure of the  <em>Rampart </em>caused the new American chargé d'affaires, John Murray Forbes, to write to Patrick Lynch protesting about breaches of privateering rules. In his replies Lynch makes no mention of the Argentine claim to sovereignty - like the Buenos Aires government he knew nothing about it. Forbes also denounced Jewett to the US government as a pirate. The  <em>Rampart </em>was later released, but her cargo was forfeit.</p><p>Jewett was replaced as captain of the  <em>Heroína </em>by an Englishman, Colonel William Robert Mason, who arrived at Port Louis on 21 April 1821. Jewett returned to Buenos Aires in the ship that had brought Mason and a new crew, and finally left the service of the United Provinces. He still kept the news of the 'taking possession' of the Falklands to himself, but he could not prevent the publication of his letter to Captain Orne in the  <em>Salem Gazette </em>on 8 June 1821. This letter was the first news of Jewett's claim; it was reprinted in the  <em>Times </em>of London on 3 August 1821 and its substance (though not its full text) was reported in a Gibraltar newspaper. This was then picked up by a Cadiz newspaper. Its report was finally reproduced, as if it were a foreign news story, in the  <em>Argos </em>of Buenos Aires on 10 November 1821. This was the first intimation to the Buenos Aires government of any claim raised by Jewett to the Falklands.</p><p>By the time news of his actions reached Buenos Aires, Jewett himself was about to leave. In mid-1822 he went to Brazil in a former Spanish ship named  <em>Maipú </em>, which had been captured by his successor William Mason and sent to Buenos Aires. The ship was now Jewett's property, and he sold her to the Imperial Brazilian navy, which renamed her  <em>Caboclo. </em>Jewett was commissioned as captain of the frigate  <em>Union </em>on 6 October 1822, and served with distinction in the Brazilian navy, chiefly on shore, reaching the rank of  <em>Chefe de Divisão </em>, or vice-admiral. On the outbreak of war between Brazil and the United Provinces in early 1826, he asked to be excused from active service on grounds of health - he was now 54 years old. He continued to hold high rank in the Brazilian navy, which blockaded Buenos Aires until peace was declared in 1828. In 1827 he was sent to oversee the building of two warships in the United States, where he met and married Eliza McTiers. Their only child, Augustine David Lawrence Jewett, was born in Wilkesbarre, Pennsylvania, on 12 January 1830. The family then returned to Brazil.</p><p>During the dispute between Argentina and the United States over the Falklands in 1831-1833, Jewett actively assisted the US government. Francis Baylies, the US chargé d'affaires in Buenos Aires, wrote on 1 January 1833 to Secretary of State Edward Livingston saying:</p><blockquote><blockquote>Jewett - Pirate as he is, having a deadly quarrel with the Govt of Buenos Ayres - is on our side, and has given Captain <a href=\"/biographies/duncan_silas\">DUNCAN</a> much valuable information respecting the waters of the Río de la Plata and the best mode of annoying Buenos-Ayres in the event of a naval war.</blockquote></blockquote><p>Jewett retired from the Brazilian service in 1832, but retained his rank in their navy, promoting the introduction of steamships. He retired completely in 1836 and died in Brazil on 26 July 1842; his wife Eliza died only a few months later.</p><p><strong>William Robert Mason</strong></p><p>No account of Jewett would be complete without a brief summary of his successor as captain of the  <em>Heroína </em>, William Mason, who was born in Britain but had spent many years in Philadelphia before entering the service of the United Provinces. He took over from Jewett as captain of the  <em>Heroína </em>on 23 April 1821 and three weeks later on 13 May 1821 he sailed from the Falklands in her, leaving Port Louis deserted. He headed for Manila in the hope of finding Spanish prizes there, but the  <em>Heroína </em>was still leaking so badly that he had to turn back from Cape Horn up the Atlantic. He eventually captured the Spanish ship  <em>Maipú </em>, which he converted into a privateer; Jewett later took her to Brazil. With these two ships Mason captured a Portuguese ship, the  <em>Viscondesa do Río Seco </em>, whose cargo they sent to Buenos Aires in another ship. This too was a breach of the privateering rules, and it was also piracy again, as she was not Spanish. The  <em>Heroína </em>and  <em>Maipú </em>also fired at the Portuguese naval frigate  <em>Providencia,  </em>but she outsailed them. The leaky state of the  <em>Heroína </em>forced Mason to put into Gibraltar on 21 November 1821, and on leaving again four months later in March 1822, the  <em>Heroína </em>was captured by a Portuguese frigate. She was taken into Lisbon, where a prize court condemned her as a pirate ship, both for the seizure of the  <em>Carlota </em>under Jewett and the  <em>Viscondesa do Río Seco </em>under Mason. Mason spent most of 1822-1824 in a prison hulk in Lisbon until the British ambassador, Sir Edward Thornton, obtained his release.</p><p>Francis Baylies sent copies of the court proceedings to US Secretary of State Livingston to back up the protests made earlier in Buenos Aires. He reported:</p><blockquote><blockquote>The proceedings in the Portuguese Court shew that from her papers she appeared to be a national vessel belonging to Buenos-Ayres and commissioned to cruise against the Spaniards, but 45 of her crew 'spontaneously' confessed that her employment was piracy, 'plundering all vessels she could overhaul'... Such is the vessel and such the officers and crew on which Luis Vernet relies, as having taken formal possession of the Falkland Islands in behalf of the Argentine Republic. If his memorial is to be considered as having been adopted by the Government of Buenos-Ayres as a part of the exposition of right and title to the Islands - then it follows that the Heroine is considered by them as a national vessel - and it is equally true that this national vessel of Buenos-Ayres was a common pirate infesting the high seas, and of the same character with those of the Barbary States, and incapable of securing to that nation, by any act, any of those rights which are regarded as legitimate, by nations - which respect the usages which form the law amongst civilized people.</blockquote></blockquote><p>Both David Jewett and William Mason now feature as 'governors of the Malvinas' in Argentine Falklands mythology. In fact neither held any official position in the Falklands; Mason spent only three weeks there, and both were long gone by the time the government in Buenos Aires found out that a claim to the Islands had been made. At various stages in their careers, both were pirates.</p>",

        "body": " <p>author and lexicographer, was born in Lichfield, Staffs on 7 September 1709, the elder son of Michael Johnson, bookseller, and Sarah Johnson, née Ford. He was educated at Lichfield Grammar School, the King Edward VI School, Stourbridge, and in 1728 he went to Pembroke College, Oxford, leaving in 1729 without a degree. Unable to earn a living as a teacher in the provinces, he moved to London in 1737 and embarked on a writing career. Beginning with a series of political pamphlets and parliamentary reports for the  <em>Gentleman's Magazine, </em>his work over the next three decades was prolific and varied. In his sixties, encouraged by Henry Thrale, MP for Southwark, Johnson returned to political pamphleteering in support of the government of Lord North. Newly appointed Prime Minister by George III, North consolidated his hold on government as a result of the Falkland Islands crisis of 1770. In June of that year the Spanish seized the settlement at Port Egmont (West Falkland) ousting the British military garrison based there. In February 1771 North easily won a vote in Parliament for a diplomatic agreement which had been negotiated with Spain. Johnson's pamphlet  <em>Thoughts on the Late Transactions Respecting Falkland's Islands,  </em>was <em> </em>written in 1771. It was directly provoked by a letter written by 'Junius' (the anonymous pamphleteer and master of political polemic whose identity remains a matter of speculation). Between 1769 and 1772 a series of letters from Junius appeared in the  <em>Public Advertiser </em>voicing the opposition's dislike of the settlement. In support of North, Johnson described the Islands as 'a few spots of earth... in the deserts of the ocean,' and gave a lucid résumé of their history up to the Spanish seizure of Port Egmont. The 1771 settlement allowed the British garrison to return to Port Egmont: 'an island' Johnson wrote 'thrown aside from human use, stormy in winter, and barren in summer; an island, which not the southern savages have dignified with habitation; where a garrison must be kept in a state that contemplates with envy the exiles of Siberia; of which the expense will be perpetual, and the use only occasional'. Johnson played down the British failure to settle the question of sovereignty, arguing that Britain's honour had been satisfied with the restitution of Port Egmont. 'A war declared for the empty sound of an ancient title to a Magellanick rock' could not have been justified. Johnson's language increased in hyperbole as he put the case for peace, answering and equalling Junius with his polemic. The diplomatic settlement of the Falklands crisis, Johnson concluded, had left the warmongering Junius toothless and he could now be tolerated since 'no man hates a worm as he hates a viper'.</p><p>In 1775 Oxford awarded Johnson an MA for services to literature, in particular for his best known work,  <em>A Dictionary of the English Language </em>. He died in London in 1784. He married Elizabeth Porter, widow, in 1735; he had no children. Johnson's observations have been frequently quoted, usually by those who wish to denigrate the Islands. Johnson was unfair, but his rhetoric sprang from political passions in London rather than any close knowledge or experience.</p>",

The family moved regularly, influenced by Charles Jones's role as one of the preachers at the presbytery and thereby involved in preaching and instructing chapel members and conducting prayer meetings.</p><p>Jones left school at 14 and was employed as a clerk and compositor with the local printers, but left in 1863 for Denbigh where he continued in printing. He had a lively and enquiring mind, spending his spare time in bookshops but never neglecting worship by regularly attending chapel meetings. The constraints of life in Wales at the time were such that emigration was rife and inevitably Jones announced to the dismay of his parents that he was to join a company of settlers to Chubut in Patagonia. The settlement followed protracted discussions between Welsh representatives and the Argentine government which at one time involved the British chargé d' affaires in Buenos Aires, when it was suggested that the Argentine Congress would approve the settlement if the British Government would cede the Falkland Islands to Argentina. The chargé responded that it would be wrong for the Argentine Congress to consider that there was the slightest hope of this happening. The settlement proceeded under the auspices of the British Land and Emigration Commissioners who approved of the settlement at New Bay. Jones sailed with 152 others on 25 May 1865 and immediately started compiling a diary which is the only detailed record of the journey.</p><p>Jones was an excellent correspondent, unfailing in his letter-writing to relatives at home and from which we are able to piece together his subsequent movements. The settlers arrived at a time too late for sowing and the trials and tribulations they suffered in the first six months or so are outlined in a long letter from Jones. They only survived in fact because of aid provided by the Argentine government in the form of food and a boat. Some of the settlers were aggrieved and when a sealing boat of the Falkland Island Company put in to New Bay {Golfo Nuevo} in March 1866, took the opportunity to prepare and sign a letter to the governor of the Falkland Islands, outlining their grievances. This was carried by Jones and a fellow settler David John on the <em>Fairy  </em>which arrived at Stanley on 9 May 1866. Jones clearly intended to return to the Welsh settlement as he left possessions there and did not sign the letter.</p><p>Governor <a href=\"/biographies/mackenzie_james\">MACKENZIE</a> responded promptly and vigorously, taking depositions from Jones and John and the master of the <em>Fairy </em>which resulted in the dispatch of a naval vessel HMS <em>Triton </em>to the Welsh settlement. The subsequent enquiry established that the discontent arose from a minority and that the Argentine government was blameless. The report was circulated to both Houses of Parliament. The settlement is of course still thriving.</p><p>Jones took up employment as a lighthouse keeper at Cape Pembroke and his diary, which is owned by the FIC, is on permanent loan to the FIG Archives. It represents an excellent record of daily life in the colony in the nineteenth century and was published in the 1998 Falkland Islands Journal. He was a deeply religious man of some sensitivity and would probably have returned to Chubut, but for becoming frustrated when he received no word that a return would be wise. He therefore decided to return to Wales, working his passage as a steward and arriving at Liverpool on 3 May 1868. He settled in Holywell, Flintshire, and worked for the post office until his retirement in 1904. He never married and spent his leisure time in the service of the Presbyterian Church, caring particularly for children and the less fortunate. For one who spent so little time in Patagonia and the Falkland Islands, he made a significant impact on their history. A landmark outside Chubut is named Twr Joseph (Joseph's Tower) in his memory.</p>",

He was educated at St. Paul's School Hammersmith, London and Trinity College Dublin. He read natural science, specialising in zoology and graduated in 1903. His first appointment (1903-1910) was as assistant naturalist with the Irish fishery service. Here he learnt the necessary skills of marine biology and oceanographic methods on the  <em>Helga  </em>exploring life on the continental shelf west of Ireland. In 1910 he worked as senior assistant at the Indian Museum, which later became the Zoological Survey of India of which he was superintendent, where amongst other things he researched and published work on Crustacea.</p><p>In 1923 while home in Great Britain he was asked whether he would be willing to apply for the post of Director of Research with the newly founded Discovery Committee. Early in 1924 after the scientific members of the Committee had read his research papers he was offered a three year contract. One comment was 'systematic work of the extent and kind which Dr. Kemp has produced is to my mind in itself a proof of the highest ability and capacity'. Starting work on 2 June 1924 he produced the General Plan of Work of the Discovery Expedition. In many ways his hands were tied. Details of the ship, her Captain and the Marine Station in South Georgia had already been decided.</p><p>Kemp was responsible for planning the scientific work, frequently difficult because of distance and poor communications between the ships and ship and shore whether on board the  <em>Discovery </em>1925-27 or on  <em>Discovery II </em>1929-1931 or in London. Between these voyages he very strongly advised against further use of the  <em>Discovery </em>as a scientific research ship and then ensured every detail of  <em>Discovery II  </em>was as perfect as possible.</p><p>He was beloved by colleagues even though he led from the front working seven days a week and long hours as well. He paid meticulous attention to every detail whether carpentry, taxonomy, writing reports or the needs of his staff. He adhered to the idea that they should collect anything and everything they thought interesting whether on land or at sea, or biological or physical details. This attitude laid the foundations for the Discovery collections, and the oceanography of the South Atlantic. There were occasional directives from the Committee which interrupted the scientific programme.</p><p>RRS <em>Discovery </em>owned by the Falklands and registered in Stanley was based in South Georgia for two summer seasons paying goodwill visits to Stanley, in April-May 1926 and May-June 1927. There he dined with Governor <a href=\"/biographies/middleton_sir\">MIDDLETON</a> and HH Gresham the FIC Manager.</p><p>In London Kemp worked in the Colonial Office and left the employ of the Committee in 1936 when he was appointed secretary of the Marine Biological Association and director of its Plymouth laboratory. He became a member of the Discovery Committee as a consultant until his death of leucopenic anaemia on 16 May 1945. He published 71 papers either alone or jointly including three in the  <em>Discovery Reports </em>, three in  <em>Nature </em>and one in the  <em>Geographical Journal </em>. His honours included Fellowship of the Royal Society 1931, the Victoria Medal of the Royal Geographical Society 1936 and President of the Zoology Section of the British Association in 1938.</p><p>Kemp was an exceptionally modest man who eschewed all publicity yet he insisted that work done by the scientific staff must be published, with each author allowed 50 offprints. He was an excellent cabinetmaker and had a great interest in antiques. He enjoyed a wide range of music, singing Gilbert &amp; Sullivan on board ship.</p>",

He went to local schools and when he left school took up an apprenticeship at a local engineering firm. At the beginning of World War II he joined the RAF and was selected for pilot training and in 1943 as a flying instructor. He was sent to America to be trained and returned for active service; his proudest moment was dropping food for the starving Dutch people in the winter of 1944-5. On VE day Kerr met his future wife Joyce Gustard in a pub in Louth, Lincolnshire. They were married in March 1947.</p><p>After leaving the RAF, Kerr returned to Arbroath to finish his apprenticeship but then decided to go for his commercial pilot's licence, financing himself by working on the land and wherever he could. At the same time he trained as a civil flying instructor. He then worked for Airworks Services Ltd, a company teaching the new generation of RAF pilots to fly. During this time the Kerrs had two daughters, Cherry (b1949) and Jane (b1954).</p><p>In September 1954, Kerr arrived in the Falkland Islands to take up a three year contract as chief pilot with FIGAS. He first flew on 20 September in Auster seaplane VP FAA. Joyce Kerr and the girls followed in April 1955 and the family lived in Marine House in the heart of Stanley. Kerr had chosen Marine House as he dearly wanted his family to be part of the community. On 18 August 1955, Kerr took Ian <a href=\"/biographies/campbell_ian\">CAMPBELL</a> up in the Auster to begin his training as a pilot and on 8 February 1956 awarded Campbell his private pilot's licence enabling him to go to the UK to take his commercial licence.</p><p>The Duke of <a href=\"/biographies/edinburgh_the\">EDINBURGH</a> visited the Falklands in 1957 and Kerr had the honour of flying him around the Islands on 8 January. In September 1957 Julia, his third daughter, was born, and six weeks later the family returned to the UK on leave knowing that Kerr was to return to the Falklands as the first director of civil aviation, no longer on contract but P &amp; P (permanent and pensionable ). The Kerrs had decided to make the Islands their home.</p><p>During his many years of flying in the Falklands Kerr turned out (along with Ian Campbell) in all weathers to fly medical flights, look for lost people and deliver vital supplies. He even liked flying the Darwin School kids! The two pilots flew together for 20 years and they were the happiest of Kerr's life. He valued his friendship with all the inhabitants of the Islands and knew he would be welcomed anywhere, even when he was ill - he once had to stop off at New Island for a few days to recover from 'flu.</p><p>During his 27 years in the Islands Kerr did not take a day's local leave (much to his long suffering wife's chagrin), he just loved his job. Most people knew him by sight because he nearly always wore his trademark navy blue beret, except of course when he was wearing his kilt. For relaxation he played badminton and was a member of the badminton club for many years, he also refereed football matches and was well known for his intolerance of 'bad' language, on the pitch. He was also a regular in the side bar of the Rose Hotel, sometimes referred to as his second home by Velma MALCOLM.</p><p>In 1965 he was awarded the MBE for services to the Islands and its people, to him this was a great honour. His saddest time was October 1976 when Campbell was killed in a flying accident whilst Kerr was in UK for medical reasons. In 1980 the first Islander aircraft arrived in the Islands and Kerr took VP FAY up on its inaugural flight on 25 May.</p><p>In 1981 the Kerrs retired to Louth to enjoy the company of his family which included five grandsons and in later years two great-grandsons.

        "body": "<p>governor, was born in 1818 in the West Indies, the son of David C Kerr, a commissary (military supply officer). He spent almost all his life in the Caribbean, entered the public service in 1855 and was a member of the House of Assembly in Barbados for three sessions from 1863-1866, representing the parish of St Joseph. In 1877 Kerr was a member of the Barbados legislative council and a judge of the assistant court of appeal (at £450 a year). He later referred to his 'loyalty to Governor Hennessy [of Barbados] when he [Hennessy] encouraged such furious hostility...and was deserted by most of those whose duty it was to assist him'. During 1878-9 Kerr administered the government in Grenada.</p><p>In August 1843 Kerr married Frances Ann Toppin: they had two daughters, Frances Evangeline Inniss and Isabellah Blanche Fleming. In April 1857 he was married a second time as a widower to Anna Maria, the daughter of Daniel Douglas a planter. They had two sons, Allan and Mark, and two daughters, Lilias and Mabel.</p><p>Kerr was appointed governor of the Falkland Islands in 1880 when he was already over the normal retiring age and he served for ten years - about twice the usual term. The family arrived in the  <em>Theben </em>on 24 November 1880 - 'I can speak very favourably of the comfort which we enjoyed' he told London. His age was accentuated by a long white beard and Captain <a href=\"/biographies/wiseman_william\">WISEMAN</a> observed that Kerr was 'a charming man but such a fuddler and very loath to lose anyone to whom he can pour out his troubles, and they are many'. On the family, he remarked 'His Excellency is a very pleasant gentlemanly man, most unsophisticated, as indeed are all his family. He has lived nearly all his life in the West Indies, principally at Barbados. Mrs Kerr is a very pleasant motherly creature who has never been to England in her life, having been born in the West Indies and always lived there'.</p><p>In January 1881 Kerr was received by the two royal princes <a href=\"/biographies/albert_victor\">ALBERT EDWARD</a> and <a href=\"/biographies/george_v\">GEORGE</a> on board HMS  <em>Bacchante </em>. They remembered him from their visit to Barbados the preceding year; but trouble in the Cape Colony meant that their stay was cut to 36 hours.</p><p>Kerr was unfortunate that his treasurer JW <a href=\"/biographies/collins_john\">COLLINS</a> was corrupt and when the latter's safe was eventually forced open a succession of administrative horrors emerged. Collins was arrested on 31 December 1881 and Kerr appointed his son Allan to hold the fort. Sorting out the confusion took its toll: Kerr reported 'my own health has suffered severely from such close application and night work'.</p><p>The colony was financially self-supporting during Kerr's term of office, but he faced problems over the survey and leasing of land. The FIC and the larger landowners were opposed to a proper survey (as it would reveal that their holdings were much larger than they were claimed to be) and wished to prolong their leases or change them into freehold. Kerr originally opposed them, writing to London in 1881: ' It is not desirable to dispose of the crown lands in such a way as to strengthen powerful local interests to the prejudice of small independent settlers'. Having resisted them until 1885, Kerr changed his view completely after his leave in England during 1886. His successor <a href=\"/biographies/goldsworthy_sir\">GOLDSWORTHY</a> attributed this change to the fact that the Governor's daughter Mabel had married a West Falkland landowner.</p><p>Kerr took nine months sick leave from March to December 1886 (thus missing the second peat-slip in Stanley, which swept away several buildings and killed two people) and ACS <strong>BARKLY</strong>stood in as lieutenant-governor. Kerr later took six months leave in 1889-90, when EP <a href=\"/biographies/brooks_edward\">BROOKS</a> administered the government.</p><p>On his return in 1890 Kerr found that he had been attacked in Parliament by an Irish MP, Swift MacNeill, on the prompting of James <a href=\"/biographies/smith_james\">SMITH</a> of Stanley. MacNeill asked why Kerr was returning to Stanley aged 72 and implied that there were charges of embezzlement against him. A committee of LegCo (FE <a href=\"/biographies/cobb_frederick\">COBB</a> and JJ <a href=\"/biographies/felton_john\">FELTON)</a> exonerated the governor, though in unenthusiastic terms. The final LegCo of Kerr's term authorised the sale of lands to the FIC, despite the protests of Dr <a href=\"/biographies/hamilton_samuel\">HAMILTON</a> that the two unofficial members (Cobb and Felton) had interests. Kerr laid the foundation stone of the new cathedral on 6 March 1890.</p><p>Kerr's daughter Mabel married Charles Anson on 7 April 1885: they had three sons born in the Falklands, two of whom died in Stanley during the influenza epidemic of 1890. Lilias Kerr married Commander Frederic Echlin RN in Stanley on 2 December 1885.</p><p>Kerr left Stanley on retirement on 28 March 1891. In a plea for a substantial pension (£500 a year) he pointed out that he only received £22 a year from Barbados and had no private income except a trifle derived from a small sum invested in Jamaica. He added:</p><blockquote><blockquote>To myself personally my 10 years residence in this rough, cold and stormy region, after a lifelong residence in the delightful climate of the West Indies where my health was perfect and my life enjoyable has been a term of physical suffering and discomfort, a Siberia in which my health has been impaired by repeated attacks of bronchitis brought on by the inevitable exposure without which I could not conscientiously have performed the duties which devolved on me.</blockquote></blockquote><p>He retired to Barbados where he died at his home, Yair Abingdon, in August 1907.</p><p>Kerr was not really up to the strains of government and it is difficult to see why he was appointed and why kept in office for so long. FE <a href=\"/biographies/cobb_frederick\">COBB</a> told the FIC London office:</p><blockquote><blockquote>He is over seventy years of age and he is incapable of comprehending the fact that a government which disregards the wishes and susceptibilities of the people is an anachronism. He is personally unpopular and though I say nothing as to matters affecting his private character, I know enough of his ways to be able to say that I can not feel any great respect for him.</blockquote></blockquote><p>The  <em>Falkland Islands Magazine  </em>was a little kinder to him. On his departure in 1891, the April issue recorded that:</p><blockquote><blockquote> <em>During the exceptionally long period of his Governorship the prosperity of the Islands has steadily progressed. Much has been done to improve the roads and sanitary state of Stanley .....education has been made compulsory and a Savings Bank established.......the trade of the Islands has expanded and in comparison with any other British Colony, when the number of the inhabitants is considered, takes the lead. </em></blockquote></blockquote><p>By giving way to the landed interests, Kerr effectively put a brake on the development of a small farmer class and condemned the colony to stagnation and the loss of its more ambitious sons through emigration.</p>",

        "body": " <p>businessman, was born on 15 July 1923 in Hertfordshire. The family moved to Australia for a time, returning to England when he was 11 and settling in West Sussex.  He left school at the age of 15 and began working for local estate agents before joining the Royal Air Force in 1940. He remained in the RAF until the end of the war, working as ground support crew, including a period in Malta.</p><p>King had always had wanderlust and did not fancy a commuter's life in England. When, in 1951, he saw an advertisement for a job with the retail section of the Falkland Islands Company in Stanley, he seized the chance.  It was initially a four-year contract, but 56 years later he was still living in the Falklands. For many of his eighteen years with the FIC he was manager of the West Store and therefore played an important part in maintaining a flow of essential supplies for the community. In 1955 King married Falkland Islander Nanette (Ning) Pitaluga, (see <a href=\"/biographies/king_nanette\">KING</a> Nanette), and the couple had three children, Barbara (b 1958), Alison (b 1960) and Anna (b 1964). Leaving the FIC in 1969, he and his wife bought the Ship Hotel on Stanley's seafront and transformed it into a comfortable and friendly hostelry. The hotel introduced a new standard of hospitality to Stanley and was an important service to the growing tourist industry.  The Kings introduced a restaurant service and Stanley's first fish and chip shop. Later, still under their management and by then the Upland Goose Hotel, the establishment achieved some international fame as a place of safety for civilians during the Argentine occupation of Stanley.</p><p>His wife died in February 1991, but King remained active in community affairs. He had long been a stalwart supporter of Christ Church Cathedral, and held the office of trustee for fifteen years. As chairman of the Cathedral Restoration Committee, he led a campaign to save the building from further decay. £250,000 was raised to replace the roof, repair stained glass windows and renew the heating system. The adjacent Parish Hall was also totally refurbished. This work was accomplished in time to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the cathedral's consecration in 1992. He was also heavily involved with the Stanley Golf Club during its early days and served as chairman. He was the treasurer of the Stanley Horticultural Society, and chairman of the Stanley Sports Association.  Immediately after the 1982 war, he was very active in clearing the racecourse of shrapnel, abandoned Argentine equipment and unexploded ordnance. In preparation for the special race meeting of 1983 (to mark the 150th anniversary of British government), he secured much help from racecourses in the UK to bring the course up to the standard required. He retired from the Sports Association three years later and is now one of the vice-presidents.</p><p>Now happily retired, King spends the winter months at his home in West Sussex and the summer months at his home in the Falklands.  He is still actively involved in his own company as managing director of the Gift Shop Ltd, which owns two retail outlets in Stanley. He is also a director of the Argos Fishing Company.</p><p><a href=\"/biographies/chalfont_alun\">See Image 80</a></p>",

        "body": "<p>councillor, was born in Stanley on 12 May 1930, the third child of Alexander Pitaluga and Eva Amelia, née Hansen. Alexander was the manager of Gibraltar Station at San Salvador on East Falkland, and Ning grew up enjoying a typical rural Falklands life. She was taught mainly by travelling teachers, among them Jeffrey <a href=\"/biographies/hamm_jeffrey\">HAMM</a>, but spent periods at school in Stanley, first at the Catholic school run by nuns attached to St Mary's Church, and later at the government school. She left - as all children did in those days - at the age of 15 and returned to Salvador as the settlement teacher, notwithstanding her age and the responsibility involved. Among Ning's pupils was her brother Robin, who was just three years younger than her, and three cousins.</p><p>On 5 November 1955 in Christ Church Cathedral, Stanley, Ning Pitaluga married Desmond <a href=\"/biographies/king_desmond\">KING</a>, who had come to the islands to work for the Falkland Islands Company, They settled in Stanley, where they had three daughters, Barbara (b1958), Alison (b1960) and Anna (b1964). Motherhood was a full-time job, but in March 1968 Ning stood for LegCo, and was elected to represent Stanley. In those days the Governor nominated a proportion of the Council, and while women had served as nominated members, and a woman had been elected to represent the East Falkland Camp, she was the first woman to be democratically elected to represent the Stanley constituency. At the same election, her brother Robin was elected to represent East Falkland - the first and only time that siblings had served together on LegCo.</p><p>In November 1968 Lord <a href=\"/biographies/chalfont_alun\">CHALFONT</a>, then a junior minister at the Foreign Office, visited Stanley on a mission to encourage rapprochement between the Islands and Argentina. Like most other Islanders, Ning King was hostile to the Argentine claim and suspicious of the apparent British intention to part with the Islands. Lord Chalfont addressed a joint meeting of Executive and Legislative Councils. <em>Just prior to the arrival of Lord Chalfont, the two Councils were temporarily amalgamated to facilitate discussion of, and responses to, the proposals and pressures brought by him and his team. After his departure, it was agreed to carry on with the joint Councils arrangement for the remainder of that Council's period in office. </em>The sovereignty issue dominated council business then, as it does now, but Ning took pride in dedicating time and effort to issues that made a difference to the everyday lives of her constituents. It was typical that she was proud to have been the moving force behind the establishment of a children's park in the centre of Stanley. Following in the footsteps of her mother, Ning became involved in the Red Cross Society, and spent many years as chairman. She also dedicated much time to the establishment and running of the Stanley Youth Club - no mean feat, considering this meant raising funds for and supervising the building of a clubhouse at the west end of Stanley's Victory Green.</p><p>In 1969 Des and Ning King bought the Ship Hotel from the Falkland Islands Company. The hotel had operated only as a pub for many years, but the Kings renamed it The Upland Goose, refurbished the rooms and began catering to a gradually growing tourist trade. For many years it was the only hotel in Stanley. The Kings introduced a restaurant service, public and lounge bars and a fish and chip shop. During the Conflict of 1982, they opened the hotel to local people: the thick stone walls, supplemented by window embrasures filled with bags of corn and flour, offered relative safety as Stanley came under bombardment.</p><p>In 1987 the Upland Goose Hotel was sold to Witte Boyd, a British fishing company, and Ning and Des King retired, planning to spend their retirement between a new house in Stanley and a home in West Sussex. However, while in the UK, Ning was diagnosed with cancer, and she died soon afterwards on 8 February 1991. Her ashes were returned to the Falklands to be interred at Salvador, the farm she had always called 'God's Own Country.' A plaque in the Cathedral honours her memory and that of other members of the Pitaluga family.</p><p><a href=\"/biographies/chalfont_alun\">See Image 80</a><br><a href=\"?q=node/273\">See Image 202</a></p>",

        "body": "<p>printer, was born in 47 Fitzroy Road, Stanley on 11 February 1921 to Fred King and Ella, née Biggs. King spent his childhood next door at 49, and moved to 39 Fitzroy Road when he was married, essentially living his whole life on the same road. He was educated at the Government School in Stanley and on leaving school in 1936, he became messenger boy at the Post Office for two pounds and ten shillings per month. In March 1938 King began a five-year apprenticeship in the Printing Office and on completion was appointed assistant printer. He was promoted to head printer in 1959. He loved his trade and spent almost his whole working life in the Printing Office. Over his career he prepared a wide variety of printing, from wedding invitations and sweepstake tickets to the Falklands Councillors' appeal to the British Parliament in 1968 and the document conferring the Freedom of Stanley on Margaret Thatcher in 1983. He retired on 20 September 1988 after 52 years Government service.</p><p>King served in the Falkland Islands Defence Force for 24 years, attaining the rank of sergeant and receiving a number of long service and efficiency decorations. His early service coincided with World War II and he served as a signaller on outposts around Stanley, keeping watch for invading forces. He was also a member of the FIDF band, where he played a number of instruments including the cornet. Along with other members, King represented the Falklands at the 1953 Coronation Parade in London: he always maintained that he got his Coronation medal for walking 13 miles in the driving rain! He was called up when the <a href=\"/biographies/condor_group\">CONDOR</a> Group landed a hijacked Argentine DC4 on Stanley Racecourse in 1966.</p><p>In his younger days, King was a very keen footballer and played as left half for Stanley's First Eleven against visiting naval vessels. He was also a keen badminton, snooker and darts player and loved ice-skating in the winter on ponds around Stanley. He tended his putting green at 39 Fitzroy Road with love and dedication for 57 years. His first golf club as a child was apparently a flattened syrup tin nailed to the end of a stick which he carried around in a horse's nosebag.</p><p>King was well known in the Falklands through his insurance agency which he operated for some thirty nine years. Much paperwork for customers was delivered personally as he particularly enjoyed keeping in touch with people he had known for years. A quick visit by a customer to 39 Fitzroy Road to pay a premium could also turn into a much longer stay once the chatting, or golf, got underway!</p><p>King married Gladys Eveline Pettersson, the seventh child of Frans Axel Pettersson and Caroline, née Newman, on 14 March 1947 in Christchurch Cathedral. They had two sons Peter Thomas (b1955) and Robert John (b1960). Both Kings had a passion for the outdoors and he loved to get away to fish for mullet and trout. He was also a conservationist at heart, and was never upset if a fine sea trout escaped from his hook, as he believed that after a strong fight it deserved its freedom. He was also involved in the initiative to prevent the shooting of wildlife on Stanley Common and Cape Pembroke. Both the Kings loved dancing and were very adept ballroom dancers.</p><p>King had a deep love for his homeland, and hated with a passion the Argentine claim to sovereignty. He was a member of the Falkland Islands Committee which vigorously supported the campaign for Falkland Islanders to determine their own future. Over the years King also directly supported many other clubs and organisations - The Boys Brigade; Stanley Co-operative Society; Home Industries; Horticultural Society; Rifle Club; Civil Servants' Association; Working Men's Social Club. He was a talented cartoonist and his contributions often appeared in the <em>Weekly News </em>, signed - in true punning fashion - 'JoKing'. A prophetic drawing published in 1946 - after the discovery of oil in Tierra del Fuego had been announced - shows workmen digging a deep hole for the new concrete lamppost on the Front Road outside Government House; one is calling down to the other 'Found any of that there oil yet, Joe?'  He contributed to the Broadcasting Committee for which, in addition to the very popular <em>In the Potting Shed with Joe and Gene </em>, which he produced with Gene Williams, he also gave darts match commentaries and popular musical/chat programmes. King was awarded the MBE in 1976 for services to the community.</p><p>He died peacefully at KEMH on 19 February 2005.</p><p><a href=\"/biographies/bennett_harold\">See Image 29</a></p>",

His father Franz Klutschak was chief editor and later owner of the magazine <em>Prager Bohemia </em>. Heinrich Klutschak studied geography and cartography at the German Polytechnical Institute in Prague to become an engineer. At the same time he attended the Artillery Academy and in 1866 was posted to the Imperial and Royal Artillery, which he left in 1871 to emigrate to the United States of America. Later he signed up on a whaler from New London, Conn, for a voyage to Repulse Bay in northern Canada.</p><p>When Captain William Dunbar started a sealing expedition to South Georgia in 1877, Klutschak came aboard the schooner <em>Flying Fish </em>at the Cape Verde Islands together with most of the young crew. On 22 September 1877 Shag Rocks west of South Georgia were sighted. Dunbar anchored at Flying Fish Bay {Wilson Harbour} on the NW coast, before he began an anti-clockwise voyage around the Island. At Cheapman Strand further south, elephant seals were killed to render the oil from their blubber. Klutschak disliked the mass killing, especially when young seals lost their mothers and predicted the certain extinction of this species. During a storm Dunbar found a safe anchorage in 'Eis Bai' {Undine South Harbour}. When they turned around the southern cape and landed at 'Little Hafen'{St Andrew's Bay} on the east coast in December 1877, Klutschak was astonished to find green meadows on the low hills. Here he observed such birds as albatross and penguins, which he described as most lovable. They passed Cumberland Bay and before the fur seals started to moult in mid-February, <em>Flying Fish </em>collected several hundred skins at the Bay of Islands, Bird Island, and Willis Island. On 28 February 1878 <em>Flying Fish </em>left South Georgia to return to New London. When they reached Pernambuco (Brazil), Klutschak landed to return on his own.</p><p>In summer 1878 he joined Friedrich Swatka's American Franklin search expedition as surveyor and artist. They landed on the west coast of Hudson Bay on 9 August, where they over-wintered to adapt themselves to the climate and life of the Inuit. On 1 April 1879 they started their search investigating William Land and Adelaide Land, while they were living mostly from hunting. Whenever the expedition divided, Klutschak took over the leadership of one group. It was he who investigated Franklin's last camp and obtained additional information from the Inuit. Aboard a whaler they came back to New Bedford, Mass, on 22 September 1880. Later Klutschak returned to Prague to publish a book with his travel account. He also lectured through Austria and Germany in 1881 and published several papers about the search expedition, South Georgia and Jan Mayen, (where the Austrian station for the International Polar Year 1882-1883 was to be placed). After his return to New York he failed to find an appropriate job, became ill with tuberculosis and died without means on 26 March 1890. His friends paid for his burial.</p><p>Klutschak had been a conscientious observer of man and nature and was able to adapt to the local way of life in the Arctic. His detailed ethnographical accounts of the Inuit of the Hudson Bay are still valuable today. Due to his achievements in the Franklin search expedition, he was honoured by the Emperor Franz Josef. His name was given to Klutschak Point two miles SE of Cape Demidov on the south coast of South Georgia.</p>",

In 1904 he started to study law in Munich, but soon switched over to medicine and took his PhD at Freiburg (1908) becoming an assistant doctor.</p><p>In May 1911, Kohl joined Wilhelm Filchner's expedition to the Weddell Sea, which arrived at South Georgia on 21 October 1911. Instead of sailing further south Kohl had to stay at CA Larsen's home at Grytviken to recover from an appendicitis operation. Here he met Larsen's daughter Margit. Kohl left the Island on  <em>Harpon  </em>just before Christmas. During the next year he travelled through Norwegian Lapland up to Sweden. After his marriage with Margit on 16 September 1913, he changed his name to Kohl-Larsen. His first appointment as governmental doctor of the German Imperial Colonial Department brought him to Micronesia (1914), where he was interned for two months at the start of World War I. After his return he studied zoology, the economics of primitive people and palaeontology at the University of Heidelberg (1915-1916) and volunteered as military doctor in Iraq and Persia (1916-1918). Later he worked in the Finnmark province of northern Norway.</p><p>In 1923-24 he accompanied his father-in-law aboard the first whaling factory ship to operate in the Ross Sea, <em>Sir James Clark Ross </em>. In 1926, the Kohl-Larsens finally returned to Germany and settled at Lake Constance. He next planned to concentrate on the exploration of the inland glaciation at South Georgia. Together with his wife he also wanted to make geological collections and biological observations including the first measurements of plankton in the lakes, while the cameraman Albert Benitz from Freiburg would make a film on the wildlife. Their expedition left Sandefjord (Norway) on 18 August 1928 aboard  <em>Harpon </em>and reached South Georgia within 32 days. After a short trip aboard the whale catcher  <em>Tiburon </em>, they began their investigations from a camp at Coal Harbour. From 5 to 9 November, they investigated the inland ice east of the camp towards Schlieper Bay. On 19 November  <em>Tiburon </em>brought them to their second camp at Bay of Isles, where they stayed until 7 January 1929 and explored Grace Glacier and Lucas Glacier. From the third camp, established with the little Norwegian steamer  <em>Fleurus </em>above the whaling station of Husvik on 19 January, they made a long sledge trip to the icecap inland ice. During a two-day snow storm they nearly stifled due to the dense snow covering their tent. When the weather improved they discovered that the central part of South Georgia consisted of a continuous ice plateau, connecting Jossac Bight in the west with West Cumberland Bay in the east.</p><p>After their return to Husvik, they explored the neighbourhood visiting Stromness, Leith Harbour and Hercules Bay.  On 7 February they came back to Grytviken with long meteorological records taken thrice daily at all camps. Later they made scientific investigations of the lakes and ponds around Maiviken and King Edward Cove using a Klepper* kayak. On 27 February the sealing vessel  <em>Dias </em>brought them to Annenkov Island, where Kohl-Larsen looked for fossils from 3 to 14 March. In the first week of April 1929 they circumnavigated South Georgia anti-clockwise aboard  <em>Dias. </em>At Dias Cove he discovered a wooden shipwreck and some remains of a dwelling place. A final visit was made to Royal Bay to resurvey the Ross Glacier. On 13 May the expedition left the island aboard  <em>Harpon </em>. In his travel account he published the first maps of the inland region, while his film  <em>Roah Roah </em>became the first commercial film on South Georgia, showing the expedition's activities, whaling and wild life.</p><p>From 26-30 July 1931, Kohl-Larsen participated in the expedition of the airship LZ 127  <em>Graf Zeppelin </em>to the Russian Arctic as far as Franz Josef Land. He was responsible for the equipment and for biological investigations during the flight. In 1932 Kohl-Larsen moved to Tanganyika {Tanzania} to establish a coffee plantation. Accompanied by his wife he led an ethnological and prehistorical expedition (1934-1936) and directed archaeological field work in the Lake Eyasi basin in northern Tanganyika (1937-1939), where they discovered human bones and artefacts ranging in date from the Middle Stone Age to the Iron Age. Following these sensational discoveries, he was offered the chair of ethnology at the University of Cologne and appointed honorary professor of the University of Freiburg in 1939. He also received the Rudolf Virchow Commemorative Medal.</p><p>In 1941, during World War II, he became extraordinary professor at the University of Tübingen and was called up as medical officer to serve at Salonica (Greece). In 1943 he was posted to Finnmark, where he also resumed his ethnological studies of the Lapps. In late autumn 1944 he had to return home because of a severe accident. After the war he was rejected as a creative artist due to his membership in the Nazi Party since 1930 and was not denazified before 1948. On 12 November 1969 he died in Thumen at Lake Constance, while Margit died at the age of 99 in Öschelbronn close to Stuttgart on 17 January 1990.</p><p>The large ice plateau in the hinterland of Husvik was named Kohl-Larsen Plateau in 1955, but revised to Kohl Plateau in 1960.</p>",

        "body": "<p>merchant, was born in Liverpool on 14 May 1807, the son of Samuel Lafone and Mary, née Ellison. His father and grandfather were Liverpool merchants with close connections with the leather tanning industry. Alexander is unlikely to have had many memories of his mother who died when he was only five. Two years later his father remarried but there is no suggestion of any family estrangement arising from this at any time.</p><p>In 1825 his elder brother Samuel Fisher <a href=\"/biographies/lafone_samuel\">LAFONE</a> had sailed to Argentina to set up business there, and Alexander followed him within the next year or two. He was one of the witnesses at his brother's notorious wedding in Buenos Aires in 1832. As a result he was arrested and fined 500 pesos. He was kept in confinement, with the other men who were party to the ceremony, pending expulsion from the country. Some accounts assert that Alexander Lafone was expelled, but since the others were pardoned this seems unlikely. The result would, no doubt, have been the same for he preceded his brother to Montevideo (Samuel was busy getting married legally) to start the extensive business interests of the brothers in what was to become Uruguay.</p><p>After 12 years assisting his brother he returned to Liverpool with offices at 20 North John Street, Aigburth in 1839. There is no doubt that he was instrumental in finalising Samuel Lafone's investment in the Falkland Islands. He signed the agreement with the British Government (on 16 March 1846 in London) and negotiated its finance with Ricketts, Boutcher and Company. As well as his own business interests he was obviously acting as Samuel Lafone's British agent: culminating in his proposal for a company to buy out the Lafone's Falkland interests (the stillborn Royal Falkland Land, Cattle, Seal and Whale Fishery Company), and he convened the initial meeting of what was to be the Falkland Islands Company.</p><p>When that Company in frustration took the step of suing its major shareholder, Samuel, for fraud the Chancery bill included Alexander as a defendant. This reflected the importance of his role in forming the Falkland Islands Company, and the fact that many of the statements about which the Company were aggrieved had flowed from his pen. In the early part of 1857 that pen was again put to use on behalf of the brothers in writing an answer to the accusations of the Company, and this was forwarded to each shareholder with a covering letter asking them to 'form their own conclusions on the evidence that he submitted'. This was 'a recommendation with which the Directors had no disposition to interfere' relying (to paraphrase the 1857 annual report) on the judgement of the shareholders, and the fact that the Directors owned most of the shares anyway. It is clear that the younger brother had again played an important role in Samuel's affairs, and those of the Falkland Islands.</p><p>At the time these momentous events were taking place, he was living at home in the West Derby suburb of Liverpool with his father (then 81), his wife Emily Featherstone Griffin (1817-72), a sister, a two-year-old nephew, and five servants. He continued to be interested in the Falklands, battling with the colonial administration on behalf of the Company, and in particular about the establishment of a postal service. He obviously ruffled feathers since the Colonial Office described him as not easy to deal with as 'he unsettles matters previously agreed'. When his father died the family had to move from his house. Alexander and Emily Lafone moved to Thingwell Hall in the Wirral but this fine Georgian villa was to be no happy retirement home. Emily's last 15 years were blighted by mental problems, and, after her husband's death, she spent her final three years in a nursing home. Alexander had retreated to Hastings, where he died on 14 June 1869 of kidney failure.</p><p>There can be no doubt that Alexander Lafone played a significant part in the formation of his brother's business empire, and the lack of his organising abilities in Montevideo may have led to some of the problems experienced after he left, especially in relation to the Falklands venture. But he was required to pursue these in England where his role was significant. Sadly for Samuel Lafone, and the Falkland Islands, Alexander could not be in two places at once!</p>",

        "body": "<p>merchant was born in Liverpool on 6 August 1805, son of Samuel Lafone, broker and tanner of Huguenot stock, and Mary Lafone, née Ellison. He was one of a large family and his younger brother Alexander <a href=\"/biographies/lafone_alexander\">LAFONE</a> and his sister Martha's second husband John Pownall <a href=\"/biographies/dale_john\">DALE</a> also feature in the Falklands story. His Liverpool childhood was marred by the death of his mother when he was seven years old but neither that nor his father's re-marriage two years later seems to have caused any rift in the family. Indeed, when he sailed to Argentina either in 1823 or in 1825 it seems likely that this was with the full support of his family. He was never to return to his native soil.</p><p><strong>To South America</strong></p><p>In view of the speed with which he began to trade, and to acquire land, after he arrived in Buenos Aires some of his home support may have been financial. He may also have mortgaged the land on the basis of servicing the loan from future income from it. This is a good way of investing if the income is as projected but can be costly, as with his Falklands investment, where the calculation is incorrect. It is known that some of his land was at a place called Gibson on Argentina's Atlantic coast. The arrival of his younger brother Alexander was a help in the business, and no doubt provided some welcome companionship. In 1832, however, his prospering business was put at risk as a result of his choice of a companion for life. He fell in love with Maria (Mariquita) Quevedo y Alsina, a name suggesting the upper strata of colonial society, and while he had the full support of his future mother-in-law, Mariquita's father was deeply upset with the match which was a 'mixed' Protestant/Catholic union. Despite this the marriage went ahead in Maria's mother's home with a number of witnesses including Maria's mother and Alexander Lafone. The service was conducted by William Torrey an American Presbyterian minister but it was annulled by the Bishop of Buenos Aires, and mother and daughter were sent to the 'House of Spiritual Exercises' for a month 'to repent'. Lafone and Torrey were fined 1,000 pesos, and the other witnesses 500, but worse all were arrested pending expulsion. There followed intense pressures from several directions: on Samuel to convert to Catholicism (pressure which he steadfastly resisted) and diplomatic and business pressure on the City authorities to release the men. The latter was the more successful: a pardon ended three months of confinement, and on 13 June 1833 they were married for a second time in a Roman Catholic Church and six days later for a third time at the Anglican Church of St John. Lafone was only baptised as an Anglican six months after his wedding - his family in Liverpool were Baptists. (The Lafone marriage was still technically illegal since the law was only changed in the following year as a result of this case). The couple enjoyed 34 years of marriage and had three sons: Samuel Alexander Ernest (Samuelito, 1835-1920, who became Director of the Natural History Museum, La Plata, Argentina), Hope (1841-1919, who gave his name to Hope Place in Lafonia) and William Edward (1846-1897) and six daughters Maria Enriqueta (1837-1891), Martha Videla Lucy Emily (1840-1884), Mercy Annie (1853-1945), Grace Julia, (b1855) and two who died in infancy.</p><p>Someone not present at the second wedding was Alexander Lafone who had already travelled to Montevideo as part of the process of transferring the Lafone business interests away from any future problems in Argentina. Samuel Lafone was not expelled and freely entered Argentina, without hindrance, in later years. In Uruguay expansion was rapid and spectacular until the land-holding included all of the land around Punta del Este but only after some legal battles apparently to prove those rights. Other investments related to the processing of the cattle ranched on this land and from other landholders. Slaughter yards, a jerked (dried) beef factory, and a salt beef plant ( <em>saladero </em>) were built and operated profitably. In 1834 John Pownall <a href=\"/biographies/dale_john\">DALE</a> arrived to manage the  <em>saladero, </em>having taken as his second wife Samuel's sister Martha Seacombe Lafone. In England the family were closely involved with the tanning industry so it is no surprise that Lafone was a shipper of cow hides to Europe, but he was also involved with sealing at the Isla de Lobos, and in business with General Justo Jose Urquiza, the Governor of the Argentine province of Entre Rios.</p><p>Lafone may have had large landholdings but the General's approached a million hectares, sustaining 300,000 cattle. Lafone entered into a partnership with Urquiza to process these cattle through his factories. There is no suggestion that this or his other business ventures were not profitable but since his policy was to invest in more land and cattle, cash liquidity might have been a problem. Meanwhile expansion continued via a series of partnerships with British settlers who, having purchased large tracts of land, could not afford to stock them. The Lafones provided the stock as their part of the partnership. It has been suggested that Lafone used a partnership proposal with Louis <a href=\"/biographies/vernet_louis\">VERNET</a> in 1837 to gain the information he needed for his Falklands venture but this seems to be Vernet's embittered comment. By 1843 Alexander Lafone had been back in Britain for some years but was still helping his brother, and alert to new business opportunities in which Samuel Lafone might wish to invest.</p><p><strong>The Falklands</strong></p><p>So Governor MOODY's ideas for the expansion of settlement and trade between the recently re-established colony of the Falkland Islands and the Coast seemed to align with Lafone's cattle interests. Alexander Lafone's information prompted the despatch to the Islands in January 1844 of Don Marcellino Martinez, Lafone's agent, to inspect, and report back. The choice of a non-English speaker may not have been wise but Martinez should not be blamed for the mix-up over the area of the land to be leased. This was primarily the result of inadequate mapping. The report, however inaccurate, sufficiently interested Samuel Lafone to write with a proposal on the 16 March 1844, delivered by Martinez to the Islands that May. It seemed the work of an odd combination of businessman and romantic coloniser. As well as terms specifying the land to be leased (he wanted everything south of the Wickham Heights), the supply of beef and cattle to the colony, the right to slaughter wild animals anywhere on the East Falkland for six years and produce set numbers of cattle and sheep at certain intervals, it promised a clergyman, a church, and education. It also promised the right mix of workers (out of every nine, five were to be Shetlanders, one a River Plate gaucho, two from southern Chile to keep the gauchos in order, and one Basque to build the houses). But like most of his promises this was to be a pipe dream.</p><p>Negotiations proved protracted, and an agreement was not signed until 16 March 1846 by Alexander Lafone in London. Even then it was not until May 1847 that Lafone's manager, RA <a href=\"/biographies/williams_richard\">WILLIAMS</a>, arrived with 102 men, horses and stores. Some have seen the Siege of Montevideo, which had taken placeat that time, as just an excuse for inaction but since General Urquiza was a main protagonist in the conflict Samuel may have had real difficulties. Williams, then and now, has been seen as an incompetent troublemaker but the Hope Place  <em>saladero </em>was soon in operation and he quickly saw that what was on the ground did not match what had been promised. Lafone sought a renegotiation of the contract but could not agree with the alternative land offered to him by Moody, and asked for the contact to be cancelled with the return of the £10,000 he had paid as well as his expenses. Although in 1848 Lafone took the opportunity to meet the incoming Governor, <a href=\"/biographies/rennie_george\">RENNIE</a>, in Montevideo, and sent an in-law, Don Juan Quevedo, to negotiate with Moody, there was stalemate, and when Williams reneged on the promise to repatriate workers who wished to return home in 1849, Rennie closed down the  <em>saladero </em>for a year.</p><p>This was one Lafone deal that was not self-financing, and the lack of cash in his businesses did not help but such problems can be overstressed. Finance had been provided by a firm, Ricketts, Boutcher and Company, with whom the Lafone's had close links - his step-brother, Alfred, married Jane Boutcher in 1852, and was manager of the company a few years later. So Alexander could be safely left to negotiate a refinancing package. However stretched he might have been Samuel Lafone could afford to wait for a better deal. The contract signed on 9 January 1850 was wholly favourable to him. The price was reduced by half to £30,000 (the sum he had already paid and ten instalments of £2,000), he could build corrals anywhere on East Falkland and had rights over all wild animals for another ten years. Five years after that he had to prove there were still 20,000 cattle and horses, and he still had to supply set numbers of animals and beef as required to Stanley but the government could not farm in opposition to him or permit other farmers to interfere in his operations. The contract was so one-sided that complaints were inevitable, and they soon came, about Williams, about the supply of cattle, about the gauchos, and about the extermination of the cattle.</p><p><strong>The Falkland Islands Company</strong></p><p>The solution, at least as far as Samuel Lafone was concerned, was found in London and not the Falklands. It is obvious that from 1849 Alexander Lafone had been trying to find ways of injecting fresh capital into the Falklands venture. The Royal Falkland Land, Cattle, Seal and Whale Fishery Company, for which he issued a prospectus, did not materialise but it prompted enough interest for a committee to meet in January 1851 to consider buying out Lafone's interests. From there events moved swiftly, and the first meeting of the Falkland Islands Company took place on 24 April 1851. Samuel had his cash but retained a substantial interest in the Company, and the Islands, subscribing to over 200 of the 1000 shares of £100 on offer as well as being a director and 'Manager at the Falklands'. Alexander Lafone had pulled all the right strings but serious problems lay ahead. The whole edifice was based on a grossly inflated valuation of the assets taken over (£212,000) without any attempt to audit them, and whatever his title Lafone was anything but an on-site manager. The board even ignored one piece of sound advice from him and excluded store partnership with JM <a href=\"/biographies/dean_john1\">DEAN</a> from the purchase. Over many years it proved a costly mistake.</p><p>Williams was replaced by John Pownall Dale, who experienced at first hand what Governor Rennie called the 'blind confidence' of the board. Whilst it considered plans for a newspaper, a lighthouse, and other marks of civilisation, Dale found himself living in a shack with no money and his supplies dumped in the snow. Both colonists and the colonial government found fault with Dale's management, and with the Company, but as long as the Company was in control, and his brother-in-law the local manager, Lafone must have felt he could concentrate on his other business interests. It was, however, taking it to extremes to send no remittances, account and inventories to London for nearly two years. By 1854 the Company could stand no more, and Dale was dismissed, Lafone's bill, drawn on the Company for his expenses was not honoured, and, in April, a bill was presented in the Court of Chancery claiming 'fraudulent representation' against the Lafones.</p><p><strong>The Dispute with FIC</strong></p><p>However much Lafone might complain to <a href=\"/biographies/havers_thomas\">HAVERS</a>, the incoming manager, that the Company had caused most of the problems by trying to control everything from London or that they had not followed his sensible advice, there was misrepresentation and mismanagement to lay at his door. Yet was it sensible for a company to sue its major shareholder (nearly 30% of the 976 issued shares, admittedly with payment on a call in arrears)? To be fair to the Company they did not leave matters to drag on through the courts but endeavoured to settle the dispute by arbitration. Part of the reason for the four year delay in reaching final agreement was undoubtedly due to their suggested mediator, Mr B Field, dying before agreement could be reached on his appointment, and the Lafones' refusal to agree to the appointment of another referee to consider 'all the questions at issue, whether moral or mercantile'. Samuel Lafone's brother Alexander had been included in the Chancery proceedings because of his considerable role in the formation of the Company, and it was he who wrote the response to the Court early in 1857. By that time, however, matters had dragged on long enough, and the brothers finally accepted arbitration. The court case was withdrawn with each side paying their own costs. It is said that Samuel agreed to pay arrears of £13,000 on the Company shares, and that he offered to subscribe for £15,000 more shares. The Company agreed to pay the Lafones' outstanding expenses. The figures given for the arrears are hard to reconcile with the Company's own records of its issued capital. In 1855 when the dispute had just started there were arrears of £3,475 in respect of a call of £12/10s on 278 shares. These arrears were settled in 1856 but in 1857 the Company made another call for the same amount, and this call was unpaid on 244 shares. At the time the dispute was settled the latter arrears of £3,050 were paid, and the next transaction involving the shares was another call in 1861. If Samuel's default on the shares seems never to have been as high as was stated, neither were the new shares purchased. Whether he withdrew the offer or it was refused (the extra 200 shares would have given him 40% ownership of the Company, and perhaps the offer was seen as a direct threat to the existing Directors) no new shares were issued. The share capital was only increased in 1889.</p><p><strong>Later Years </strong></p><p>From the resolution of this dispute, the Lafone family had no direct role in the Falkland Islands although Samuel Lafone has one further footnote in its history. The re-supply of the missionary Allen <a href=\"/biographies/gardiner_allen1\">GARDINER</a> in Tierra del Fuego was mismanaged, and despite Lafone three times ordering supplies to be sent on from Stanley (where they had been sent because of a lack of shipping) nothing was done. He finally chartered Captain <a href=\"/biographies/smyley_william\">SMYLEY</a> to sail direct from Montevideo but by then it was too late. Interestingly Lafone and Gardiner had arranged for ships to sail monthly from the Falklands on logging expeditions to Tierra del Fuego - Lafone ever alert for new business opportunities. But this was 1851 and in the chaos of events no one thought to put the supplies on board. This interest in missionary work should not however surprise us for Lafone continued a staunch supporter of the Protestant church in South America. His greatest benefaction was the land and building costs of Holy Trinity Church in Montevideo (the original buildings were demolished in 1934 and rebuilt on the other side of the road, including the 'Lafone Hall' named in his honour). His son Hope was for many years conductor of the choir of this Church.</p><p>It is said that Lafone had further financial difficulties stemming from the Crimean War (1854-1856) either from loss of ships or deliveries made after the War ended. But it is hard to believe that, short of the loss of an entire fleet of ships, the former could hurt him greatly and the War Office must have paid in the latter case. Considering that three years later he would offer the equivalent, in today's money, of a million and a quarter pounds to settle his dispute with the Falkland Islands Company we can probably discount this story, although it is perfectly credible that he should be a supplier of salt and cured meat to the British Army. The event that caused his retirement is more understandable: the death of his wife, Mariquita, on 30 April 1866 would have been a shattering blow. Five years later, on a visit to Buenos Aires, he died of 'cerebritis' during the massive outbreak of yellow fever in that city.</p><p>The Lafone interest in the Falkland Islands Company or the Falkland Islands did not end then. His stepbrother, Alfred, a leading authority in the British tanning industry and an MP became a director of the Company, and on his death (1911) his eldest son, AW Lafone, was a director at least until 1920. The latter, with his younger brother Harold, made substantial donations to the Falkland Islands Battle Memorial Fund in 1919.</p><p>Typically Lafone is described as a 'merchant from Montevideo' or a 'Uruguayan businessman' conjuring up a picture in stark contrast to the steadfast Protestant, third generation Liverpudlian which he was. For a man who never visited, and probably had no time or intention to visit, the Falkland Islands, Samuel Fisher Lafone had a pivotal role in laying the foundations of their economic growth. It is easier to see this devout and conscientious man as having a vision that it was not in his power to implement; rather than as one whose self interest and greed led him to deliberately mislead the colonists, the British Government, and his fellow directors. But no one can look at the history of this period without some sense of frustration that Samuel Lafone could not find time to visit the Islands, and without feeling that had he done so matters would have turned out very differently and much better than they actually did. His name is commemorated by the large tract of land called Lafonia in East Falkland, and, by transference, was the name of at least four ships. The Lafone Hall is the church hall of Holy Trinity Church in Montevideo and a Lafone Street runs to Southwark docks in London. Members of the Lafone family served on the board of the FIC until the 1970s.</p>",

        "body": " <p>FIC manager, may have been the son of a Theophilus Lane, a solicitor in Hereford at the end of the eighteenth century. James Lane appears in the Law year book from the 1840s as an attorney working in the City of London. In 1857 the directors of the FIC discussed sending him out to the Falklands to examine the Company's affairs. Lane had evidently transgressed in some manner and was living on the continent, but the FIC lawyer, Bischoff, met him in Paris and said he 'appears to be quite master of the task which he has undertaken'. Lane asked for £300 for the job.</p><p>Lane arrived in the Islands on 29 August 1858 and found that his predecessor Thomas <a href=\"/biographies/havers_thomas\">HAVERS</a> had left the accounts in confusion. 'On arrival in Stanley,' he wrote, looking back ten years later, 'I found the undertaking almost at a standstill and in a general state of discredit'. The directors instructed that Lane should take over as manager, at first in an acting capacity, but he soon became established. In February 1859 the board agreed that Lane should not be asked for security as he 'has commenced his undertaking at start with an energy that has commanded the praise and respect of all who have seen the difficulties he has had to contend against'. Lane indeed was an energetic boss and rode around the Company's estates in 1861, accompanied in Lafonia by John <a href=\"/biographies/rudd_john\">RUDD</a>. Lane promoted the rearing of sheep and in his ten years in the Islands, the Company's flock rose from 5,200 to 27,200 head.</p><p>The Company, along with other landowners, had been fined for the slaughter of wild cattle (supposedly owned by the crown) on their lands. In 1862 FIC (and others) were fined. But on appeal to the Privy Council in England the ruling of the Stanley court was overturned by the Privy Council and in a judgement of 23 July 1864 the FIC were repaid £1080.</p><p>Lane was frustrated by his inability to compete with the store of JM <a href=\"/biographies/dean_john1\">DEAN</a>. He lacked Dean's ability to buy on his own authority and was frustrated that the Company's store was at the east end of town, while Dean's was more convenient and a social centre. Dean seemed to receive a steady flow of supplies, while the FIC store was understocked. In 1860 Lane refused to sit on the bench as a magistrate if Dean were also serving. Lane was also displaying a taste for litigation and for asserting the Company's rights against all comers. Governor <a href=\"/biographies/moore_thomas\">MOORE</a> noted that the Company opposed the interests of individual colonists and suspected Lane of wishing to acquire all land of economic value.</p><p>Accusations of peculation were made against Lane, as they had been against Havers, and he returned home in 1866 to defend himself before the directors. He succeeded in clearing his name in London, but then returned to Stanley without permission and alienated the board. The Company's manager in London, Cripps, had been intriguing with Lane's clerk Forster behind his back and when Lane got back to Stanley he sacked Forster, accusing him of peculation. However Forster then received a power of attorney from Cripps instructing him to dismiss Lane - which he did. When Lane finally left Stanley in 1867 it was with ill feeling all round.</p><p>Lane had proved an unpopular manager, litigious and ill-natured. But he had sorted out the Company's affairs and shown impressive energy when John Rudd was murdered in 1864. He had also made the FIC head office aware of the failings in their handling of business. It was during his term that the company paid its first dividends (of three per cent in 1863, 1864 and 1865).</p>",

        "body": "<p>naval officer and colonist, was born on 6 November 1790 at Montacute vicarage in Somerset, the fifth son of the Rev William Langdon. At 13, Langdon approached the retired Admiral Hood and with his recommendation joined the <em>Weymouth  </em>as a first-class volunteer in April 1804. He sailed with her to Madras and saw much action in several ships. When only 17 he was sent to Plymouth in command of a French prize. In 1811 he joined <em>Ringdove </em>in the West Indies as acting (later confirmed) lieutenant. He was invalided from 1812 to 1814.</p><p>Seeing no prospect of speedy promotion after the Peace of Paris in 1814, he retired and bought a merchant ship, <em>Lusitania </em>245 tons, taking her in 1821 on a trading voyage to Sydney and Hobart Town in Australia. He made several later voyages to Australia in 1823 and 1825, exchanging the <em>Lusitania </em>for the <em>Hugh Crawford </em>. He later acquired the <em>Wanstead </em>and then the <em>Hugh Laurie </em>. Langdon acquired an estate of 1500 acres in Van Diemen's Land {Tasmania} in 1823 and on several occasions brought his wife Anne (née Elliott from Somerset) and daughter Anne out with him - they gave a ball aboard <em>Hugh Laurie </em>in 1827. On return voyages from Hobart his ships twice called at Louis <a href=\"/biographies/vernet_louis\">VERNET</a>'s settlement at Port Louis in the Falklands: the <em>Hugh Crawford  </em>arrived on 22 May 1827 and sailed on 25 May; the <em>Thomas Laurie </em>arrived on 25 October 1831 and sailed on 1 November. On the second occasion, Langdon and his family were entertained by Vernet and on 29 October Vernet formally granted Langdon possession of ten square miles of East Falkland. On his return to England, Langdon urged the British government to recover control of the Falkland Islands, without displacing Vernet. In December 1833 Langdon wrote from London to say that he was returning to Van Diemen's Land and asking Vernet to agree that his grant should be assigned to a London merchant GT <a href=\"/biographies/whitington_george\">WHITINGTON</a>. On 31 May 1834, Vernet wrote back agreeing and Whitington went on to lobby the British government to settle the Islands, and in 1841 to despatch his brother JB <a href=\"/biographies/whitington_john\">WHITINGTON</a> to colonise the land bought from Langdon. In the event the British Government never recognised Vernet's right to sell land to Langdon/Whitington and JB Whitington had to buy his land afresh.</p><p>Langdon returned to Tasmania from 1834 to 1838, settling on his estate which he called Montacute and introducing blackbirds, thrushes, goldfinches, pheasants and partridges to the colony. He went back to England from 1838 to 1846, during which time his wife died and he was married again, to a second Somerset lady, also called Anne (née Chaffey). Reaching Tasmania in May 1846, he remained there for the rest of his life with only two brief visits to England. He was appointed to Legislative Council in 1853 and, after the introduction of representative government, was elected to Council from 1859 to 1872. A devoted supporter of the Church of England, he built a church on his own property. He died at Sandy Bay on 23 May 1879: his widow died at Hobart in 1902, aged 84. They had three sons and three daughters.</p><p>He was the first Englishman to own property in the Falklands, even though he never settled it. He claimed that his lobbying had helped to persuade the British government to reoccupy the Islands in the early 1830s.

        "body": "<p>Norwegian sea-captain, whaler and leader of scientific expeditions, was born on 7 August 1860 the son of Ellen Andrea née Ingebrigtsen and Captain Ole Christian Larsen from Østre Halsen outside Larvik, a port town in Southern Norway. He went to sea as a young boy, and sailed on vessels hunting the small bottlenose whales in the North Sea. This was an expanding industry and Larsen was given the command of a bottlenose vessel owned by Christen Christensen from nearby Sandefjord. Their association would become important for the future development of the whaling industry.</p><p>In the 1880s modern whaling was developing along the shores of Northern Norway. The whalers were now able to chase the large, fast swimming rorquals (blue whales, fin whales, humpback whales) with new powerful technology. The possibility of new whaling grounds in Antarctica was also being considered and in the southern summer of 1892/93, three expeditions went south. One was organized by Christen Christensen, who had the ideas, capital and a vessel named  <em>Jason,  </em>a former sealing ship. CA Larsen was hired as captain and expedition leader.</p><p>The  <em>Jason  </em>expedition caught no whales, but observed them in abundance. The expedition was also of some scientific significance. It sailed south in the western parts of the Weddell Sea, and made some scientific discoveries finding fossilised wood at Seymore Island. After returning home to Norway, Larsen and  <em>Jason  </em>again <em> </em>sailed <em> </em>south for a second season (1893/94), this time accompanied by two more vessels,  <em>Castor </em>and  <em>Hertha </em>.  <em>Jason </em>sailed back into the Weddell Sea where new geographical discoveries were made and she worked her way further south than any previous vessel in this area of Antarctica (68°10'S). The ships also visited South Georgia, arriving there on 19 April 1894. They entered several harbours along the coast and harpooned two right whales. Although both of these got away, Larsen, after returning to Norway, put forward the idea of starting a whaling operation in South Georgia. He did not, however, immediately proceed with his southern whaling plans. Instead he worked as a manager at a Finnmark (Northern Norway) shore whaling station in the late 1890s, and got valuable experience with the modern whaling industry.</p><p>In 1901 Larsen again travelled to Antarctica. He was now hired as the captain of  <em>Antarctic </em>, the vessel of the first Swedish South Polar Expedition led by Otto <a href=\"/biographies/nordenskjold_nils\">NORDENSKJÖLD</a>. This expedition carried out an extensive scientific programme along the Antarctic Peninsula, the Falkland Islands and Tierra del Fuego in South America.  <em>Antarctic </em>also visited South Georgia in 1902, arriving in Jason Harbour, Cumberland West Bay, on April 22. Reconnaissance trips were made up and down the coast, and a shore party made its way from Maiviken to a sheltered cove in Cumberland East Bay which appeared to be a former sealing site. This was named Grytviken. Larsen took  <em>Antarctic </em>in there on 14 May. The expedition stayed in Grytviken for a month, and Larsen's plans to start whaling at this particular site gradually materialized.</p><p>The Nordenskjöld expedition had a dramatic ending in 1903. In February  <em>Antarctic </em>was crushed by the ice and sank in the Weddell Sea, east of Paulet Island, on its way to pick up a shore party at Snow Hill Island further south. Before entering the ice, another shore party had been left at Hope Bay on the northern tip of the peninsula. Consequently, the expedition members - without a vessel - were spread on three different locations where they had to winter. After an epic of survival, scientists and sailors were rescued by an Argentine vessel in November 1903 and brought to Buenos Aires.</p><p>This short stay in the Argentine capital was significant for Larsen. He presented his ideas about South Georgia whaling to the local business community, and suggested founding a company and setting up a shore-based whaling station in Grytviken. The company was named Compañia Argentina de Pesca. Larsen returned to Norway, but went to South Georgia in the autumn of 1904 with three vessels (the steam catcher  <em>Fortuna </em>and the two transports  <em>Rolf </em>and  <em>Louise </em>), crew and equipment to erect a shore plant. Their arrival at South Georgia on 16 November 1904 marks the beginning of modern whaling in Antarctica. South Georgia, together with the South Shetlands, where whaling started in 1905, became the major whaling ground for years to come.</p><p>CA Larsen managed the Grytviken station until 1914. He extended the plant and in 1913 built the church for the whalers. In his last years on South Georgia, he considered plans for whaling in other areas, but instead he returned to Norway and his home outside Oslo. He bought two large inland farms and planned to develop them into model breeding farms. But he had limited success, and once more turned his attention to Antarctica and whaling.</p><p>It was well known that there were large numbers of whales in the Ross Sea, and in 1922 Larsen co-founded a company to pursue whaling there. In 1923 the factory ship  <em>Sir James Clark Ross </em>steamed south together with catcher boats and CA Larsen as the expedition leader. They worked their way through the ice into the open waters of the Ross Sea. The whaling was successful, and the expedition proved that modern whaling could be undertaken independently of shore bases. This led the way for the next big expansion of the Antarctic whaling industry, the pelagic* whaling.</p><p>Larsen was back in the Ross Sea next season. For some time his health had been failing, and he died on the whaling ground on 8 December 1924.</p><p>CA Larsen was a pioneer whaler, transferring shore station whaling from the northern to the southern hemisphere, and venturing into the Ross Sea. He was also one of the most remarkable expedition leaders of the so-called Heroic Age of Antarctic exploration - the decades before and after the turn of the century. His skill as a captain in the rough Antarctic waters was well known. Unusually for a sailor, Larsen also took an interest in scientific matters during the two  <em>Jason </em>expeditions and the  <em>Antarctic </em>expedition and during his years at South Georgia.</p><p>Larsen was married to Andrine née Thorsen (1863-1959). They had eight children of whom six survived.</p>",

        "body": "<p>chief secretary, was born on 12 December 1933, the son of Thomas Malcolm Layng and Mabel Kathleen, née Hayward. His father had a diverse career in the army, the church and academia and Layng's childhood was marked by frequent changes of home - a pattern his life was to follow. He was educated at the Dragon School Oxford, Clifton College Bristol and at Corpus Christi College Cambridge, graduating in 1957. He represented his various educational establishments at cricket, tennis and squash and was commissioned sub-lieutenant in the Navy during national service.</p><p>In June 1958, Layng was appointed administrative cadet to the Western Pacific High Commission with an initial posting to the Solomon Islands as a district officer and a second tour becoming district commissioner. In 1963, he was transferred to the New Hebrides {Vanuatu} specialising in rural development and cooperatives. In 1969 he was transferred to the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony as development and acting financial secretary before returning at his own request to the Solomons.</p><p>There Layng met David Scott, under-secretary at the Foreign Office who was in search of a new colonial secretary for the Falklands. The Foreign Office was seeking permanent solutions for the remaining outposts of Empire and believed that the Falklands could most tidily be ceded to Argentina with a suitable package of safeguards and compensation. But it would be difficult to bring public opinion round and Layng was to take soundings.</p><p>Layng was welcomed in government circles in Buenos Aires on his first arrival in 1972 and arrived in Stanley on one of the first flights by Argentine Air Forces Albatross seaplane to land in the harbour. A substantial package of benefits had been put together to influence Kelper opinion towards a more favourable view of the Argentine connection. Most important of these was the regular air service from Commodoro Rivadavia in Southern Argentina. There was also a programme of Argentine scholarships for secondary school children from the Falklands, the 'YPF agreement' which brought oil in bulk to Port Stanley to reduce the price of fuel in the Colony, the permanent airstrip at Cape Pembroke and programmes to bring Argentine tourists to the Islands and build up the tourist trade.</p><p>The second part of Layng's remit was to modernize the government of the Islands and to instill a greater willingness to reduce the financial grant in aid from London and to take a more positive attitude towards internal self-government. His first step was to persuade ExCo to change his own title to chief secretary, as part of an extensive civil service and salaries review. He then set in motion budgetary adjustments to make local services more self supporting - abolition of the 'penny post', reduction of the cheap issue of mutton to Stanley households etc. These steps were not well received by a very conservative population and a fire at the chief secretary's residence was generally believed to be an expression of local discontent.</p><p>Layng was more popular in Camp, where his frequent tours using his own Landrover and by government ship were welcomed. When acting governor, and acting high commissioner for the British Antarctic Territory, he made two visits 'down South' to South Georgia and to the Antarctic mainland and islands. He compiled a map of the two main Falkland Islands marking the best tracks between settlements and through the peat bogs. In the course of his camp drives, he captured all but six of the endemic birds of the Falklands on colour film.</p><p>At the end of his tour in the Falklands, Layng was appointed deputy governor of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands. He was made chairman of the Ellice Separation committee and then HM commissioner for Tuvalu, drawing up the blueprint for a separate Ellice Island state and its progression to independence in 1978. He was awarded the OBE in 1977. He resigned from the Foreign Service in 1978 and moved to the Asian Development Bank in Manila, where he subsequently set up his own successful development consultancy, and where he eventually retired.</p>",

        "body": " <p>Spanish naval officer. In 1803 Leal was attached to the Spanish naval command in Montevideo as a  <em>teniente de navío </em>, where he was given command of the corvette  <em>Atrevida </em>and sent to the Spanish settlement at Puerto de la Soledad (Port Louis) to serve the first of his two terms there as  <em>comandante gobernador </em>, taking over from Bernardo <a href=\"/biographies/bonavia_bernardo\">BONAVÍA</a> during April 1803. At that time the tours of duty in the Falklands had been scheduled to last one year, with the change-over occurring usually between mid-March and mid-April. The  <em>Atrevida </em>appears to have been accompanied by the brig  <em>Nuestra Señora de Belén </em>, under the command of Gerardo <a href=\"/biographies/bondas_gerardo\">BONDAS</a>, which had sailed from Montevideo on 10 March 1803, arriving at Puerto de la Soledad on 17 April, after an uncomfortable passage due to contrary gales and changeable winds. Fortunately, however, as Leal reported to Viceroy Joaquín del Pino, her cargo of provisions and other necessities to last the colony for a year, had not suffered. While the  <em>Belén </em>was being refitted for her return voyage Bonavía formally turned over the governorship of the colony to Leal, before returning to Montevideo in the  <em>Descubierta </em>, accompanied by the  <em>Belén </em>.</p><p>When Leal returned to Puerto de la Soledad in the  <em>Atrevida </em>for his second term as governor, it appears that he was again accompanied by the  <em>Belén </em>as she was involved in a dramatic incident in November 1805, which Leal reported in detail to the new Viceroy Marqués de Sobre Monte. Having received reports of repeated sightings of potentially hostile activity along the south coast of East Falkland, Leal sent six mounted armed men to investigate. The commander of the party, Pedro Ramón Pando, was able to locate the intruders by a fire they had started on the coast, which was out of control. Being on horseback the party had no difficulty in rounding up 'the enemy that offered no resistance', taking from them a launch which was beached close by. Pando was then able to capture their ship, a virtually new brig of over 250 tons, which was at anchor nearby. She was the former Spanish vessel,  <em>San Agustín </em>, which had been captured by the British privateer  <em>Antelope </em>off the coast of Chile, and which was bound for St Helena. The prize master, Andrew Johnson, with a crew of only five men, had been forced to take shelter in the Falklands by stress of weather and shortage of water. Leal's first priority was to man the brig and secure her cargo, but his efforts were in vain. Just over two weeks after her recapture the brig's improvised stone anchor dragged and the brig stranded on a nearby reef, fortunately without loss of life. The  <em>Belén,  </em>which had arrived at Puerto de la Soledad on 19 September, still under the command of Gerardo Bondas, was then sent to recover the brig's cargo, which her British crew had taken ashore to a shed they had built in their desperate attempt to lighten the brig and save her. Having loaded the cargo, the  <em>Belén </em>was in the process of taking it to Puerto de la Soledad on 29 November, when an even stronger storm broke, driving the  <em>San Agustín </em>further onto the reef, from where it proved impossible to refloat her, so only part of her cargo was saved.</p><p>On 4 January 1806, the sumaca <em>Nuestra Señora del Carmen, </em>commanded by José Sobino, reached Puerto de la Soledad, Leal reporting to Viceroy Sobre Monte, that her expected cargo and that of the  <em>Belén </em>had arrived in good condition. Then on 21 March, Leal formally notified the viceroy that he had transferred to Bonavía the garrison and everything attached to it per inventory, including four stores of peat to ensure that the settlers did not suffer an unavoidable scarcity. Leal then sailed for Montevideo, where he remained in command of the  <em>Atrevida </em>, taking part in the defence of the city when it was attacked by the British. When the fall of the city was imminent his ship was set on fire and blown up by Leal to prevent her falling into enemy hands.</p>",

The Council of the Zoological Society of London resolved at its annual meeting of 1866 to despatch Lecomte to capture a variety of birds and animals from the Falkland Islands to add to the Zoo's collection - and in particular to replace their existing example of a male Southern Sea Lion.</p><p>Lecomte left Swansea on 1 June 1867, in the coal-ship <em>Epsilon </em>and arrived at Stanley on 11 August 1867. The first fortnight after his arrival he devoted to the vicinity of Stanley, but found little of interest. In September, Lecomte went to Captain <a href=\"/biographies/packe_robert\">PACKE</a>'s establishment at Island Harbour, and stayed there a month, searching the creeks and shores diligently in that vicinity. In December he returned to Stanley, where Governor <a href=\"/biographies/robinson_sir\">ROBINSON</a> gave him a room in Government House and allowed him the use of a schooner to make several voyages to Volunteer Lagoon and the shores of East Falkland. Lecomte succeeded in collecting a variety of penguins, but did not find any sea lions until March when he collected four at the Kelp Islands off the coast of Lafonia. But these died in Stanley, for lack of suitable small fishes to eat, and on 23 May Lecomte set out again in Captain <a href=\"?q=node/227\">HANSEN</a>'s schooner <em>Felix </em>and succeeded in capturing a further four sea lions.</p><p>These four sea lions, with two warrahs, were the only mammals among the assortment of 83 animals which left Stanley for Montevideo with Lecomte on the schooner <em>Foam </em>. But the seas were stormy and 71 of the animals died before reaching Uruguay. On the mail boat to England three of the four sea lions died for lack of fish (supplies had been thrown overboard after a passenger had died of yellow fever) and Lecomte could only present the surviving female and one warrah, plus six birds to the Zoo on 24 August 1868. These were meagre results for an expedition which had cost almost £560, but the Council of the Zoo declared themselves satisfied with Lecomte's conduct during a difficult and dangerous expedition.</p><p>The Warrah survived at London Zoo for three years and the female Sea Lion did not die until 26 March 1884. As for Lecomte, he died in London on 20 December 1876; his is one of only three <em>homo sapiens  </em>deaths recorded in the Zoo's log-book known as <em>Daily Occurrences.  </em>Several photographs taken around 1870 of Lecomte with a female sea lion and with a grey seal survive.</p>",

During the three month voyage, he earned £9 2s 3d and fell in love with a young English governess named Grace White, who was bound for Chile.</p><p>Three weeks after landing at Stanley, the couple married on 27 January 1857 at Holy Trinity Church. They moved to Darwin, where Lee worked as a stockman, earning 27s a week. In 1868 the family moved to New Island where Lee was farm manager. But their eldest son Henry contracted tuberculosis due to poor food and housing. After a year they moved to Shallow Bay. Work was hard and conditions were cramped causing discontent. When the supply ships arrived they brought alcohol among other provisions, and the men would have a few drinks to escape from the daily grind. On one occasion Lee had too much to drink and had a disagreement with the boss. He was either sacked or resigned, probably the former.</p><p>In 1870 the family moved to Port Howard and settled at Many Branch, a shepherd's house about seven miles north of the settlement.

Otherwise the war had little impact, though a popular, and sometimes violent, game at school was 'pickets' in which the boys 'coaxed' drunken sailors to their liberty boat. School was compulsory up to age fourteen, but in 1924 it was extended to two years voluntary continuation, largely thanks to the efforts of the Headmaster, AR Hoare, respected by pupils and public alike.</p><p>After the continuation years, Lellman was offered temporary employment in the Secretariat at £24 p.a. in 1926, later made permanent at £66.

        "body": "<p>Baha'i and photographer, was born John Alfred Levy on 15 February 1922 in Manhattan, New York, which is also where he grew up. His father was a photographer: his mother thought his studio would be more successful without a Jewish name, so it was changed to Leonard. John graduated from high school at 16 and went to Antioch University as well as one other, but never graduated. He served in the Pacific as a navigator in the US Army Air Corps in World War II and was particularly proud of once navigating successfully by dead reckoning all the way across the Pacific, saving the crew and plane.</p><p>Though his family was Jewish, they were not particularly religious, and he considered himself an agnostic when he took on a commission to write a book on new religions in the United States. The Baha'i Faith attracted him as the most logical of these, and when Baha'i prayer aided him through that greatest of writers' crises - writers' block - he enrolled in the Baha'i Faith in December 1948. It lost him the book commission, but he never regretted his decision.</p><p>Leonard attended the 1953 Baha'i International Convention in Chicago and volunteered to move overseas to assist the development of the faith. He rather expected to save up money to move somewhere in Africa, but he seems to have been pleased when the committee overseeing volunteers asked him if he would go to the Falkland Islands. Though the Islands had a bleak reputation, Leonard took the assignment very much to heart, committing his life thereafter to the Falkland Islands through his dedication to the faith.</p><p>He arrived on the MV <em>Fitzroy </em>one calm night in February 1954 and had his first roast lunch ashore the next day with the Rev McWHAN and his wife. Within a few days, he managed to rent a room with full board above the Globe Hotel - then, as now, a pub that he recalled as being quiet and sociable. He soon offered to help the lone workman painting the outside of St Mary's - just because it looked as though he needed a hand and Leonard needed something to do. His service got him a recommendation for a job as a painter in the Public Works Department where he worked most of his first year in the Islands. He was especially pleased that first year to have known Dr Richter who carried out the tuberculosis survey, to proofread his report and to help paint the new TB ward, which led to the eradication of TB in the Islands.</p><p>Leonard also began his long, occasional association with radio in the Falklands that first year both as a guest on a regular programme introducing newcomers and hosting a series on 'Peoples of the World' which were based on some library research and then finding someone in the Islands who had been to that country who was willing to talk about it on air.</p><p>As he settled into Island life, he began to learn more about its problems. Divisions between the social classes at that time were quite strong, and while, as an American, Leonard was invited into the 'expatriate' circle, he endeavoured to maintain contacts with everyone - putting his belief in equality into action as much as he could. He eventually became a long-term supporter of the Working Men's Social Club which was a non-drinking club open to all Islanders (though not, at first, to women). He also became aware of the limited education offered, especially to Camp children who had to rely on travelling teachers. While he had no experience teaching children, he believed so much in education that he decided to give it a try - though it took a couple of applications and an even greater shortage of teachers, before he was offered a job.</p><p>Leonard began as a Camp travelling teacher with no training and no real guidance on how to go about the task, except that the books would be there waiting for him to use. When he arrived on the Beaver float plane for his first job, it had been so long since the settlement, Hill Cove, had seen a teacher that the whole population turned out to watch him lose his footing and slip neatly into the water: the only time he provided so much entertainment to so many people. In spite of the inauspicious beginning, his teaching is an abiding fond memory for many of his former pupils whom he really inspired to learn.</p><p>After covering just about every teaching 'beat' in the Islands in four years, Leonard returned to Stanley where he first helped an old Camp friend in his peat cutting enterprise for a season before making a start in the photography business. For the next ten years or so, he became the Islands' photographer, taking portraits, passport photos, offering developing services (with the help especially of Walter Felton) and becoming a 'stringer' for Associated Press.</p><p>In 1964, Leonard was delighted to receive his first Baha'i visitor, Miss Margaret Mills, and he was even more delighted when she agreed to remain and become his wife. It was a supportive union that sustained them both spiritually. With the help of an additional part-time job, that of town clerk, the couple managed to make ends meet while he continued his photography. When the end of the photography business did come, it was not through insufficient means but the loss of their rented house - when the owner's health required that he retire from Camp life - that forced the change. No other suitable house was available so the business was wound up, and he began a 20-year career with the Falkland Islands Company.</p><p>Leonard began as FIC cashier in June 1969, moving to shipping services ten years later where he assisted with cargo shipping and in the travel office with airline ticketing. He had attained an IATA preliminary diploma and was working on an advanced diploma when the 1982 war intervened and FIC's South American associations ceased. He then moved on to the Company's works department, assisting in overseeing the maintenance gang and stevedores, assisting with Island-wide fuel distribution and also working on fire and motor insurance in the Company's insurance agency. He retired with a letter of commendation in 1989.</p><p>The FIC job provided the Leonards with a number of benefits including a regular wage and a large tied house which they used for Baha'i activities as the faith grew in the Islands, leading to the formation of the Spiritual Assembly, the governing body of a Baha'i community, in 1972. The job also provided them with paid overseas leave every few years which allowed them to maintain ties with their families in the USA. In 1978 they took an extended leave to travel for the faith in Scandinavia and Scotland, bringing their slide show of the Falklands which stirred great interest.</p><p>Though retired, he was still very active up until the last year of his life. In the 1990s, he worked from time to time including stints at Falkland Farmers and <em>Penguin News </em>and as an occasional tour guide. He contributed to tutoring projects for adult literacy, and to the Spiritual Assembly's project of reading <em>Penguin News-To-Tape </em>for the sight-impaired. Sadly, he lost his wife in 1999, but by and large carried on as normal. He continued to enjoy bridge, presenting the occasional 'Classics Hour' on the radio and, amazingly for his age, playing short tennis.</p><p>But age did gradually catch up with him; he suffered from increasingly poor circulation and passed away peacefully on 29 April 2006. John Leonard was a strong and respected contributor to the Falklands community who will long be remembered.</p>",

        "body": " <p>French natural scientist and naval pharmacist, was born near Rochefort on 20 March 1794, the son of a clerk in the French navy. Lesson made his career in the naval medical service being largely self-taught in natural history, his great passion. He sailed in the <em>Coquille </em>, commanded by LI <a href=\"/biographies/duperrey_louis\">DUPERREY</a>, on a round the world voyage of discovery and scientific exploration from 1822 to 1825, being one of two surgeons responsible for aspects of natural history. They brought back to the Muséum d'Histoire Naturelle in Paris a great many specimens, some of which were hitherto unknown. Over three hundred specimens were geological. Lesson contributed to the magnificent illustrated volumes of scientific results, which he wrote up in Paris for four years after the <em>Coquille </em>'s return, becoming acquainted with a number of prominent scientists there. He then returned to Rochefort, where he taught botany and was made professor of pharmacy, and in 1835 the senior naval pharmacist. He had been elected two years earlier to the <em>Académie des Sciences </em>. A list of his publications and a summary of his life and work can be found in the <em>Dictionary of Scientific Biography </em>(New York, 1973).</p><p>The <em>Coquille </em>spent a month in the Falklands from 18 November to 18 December 1822, anchoring in the Baie Française {Berkeley Sound}. Lesson's two volume narrative of the circumnavigation, published in Paris in 1839 is entitled, <em>Voyage autour du monde . . . sur la corvette la Coquille </em>. His engraved portrait is the frontispiece. The style is personal and the narrative begins: <em>A Voyage around the World!!! These magic words unleash all my thoughts: the most burning wish of my heart is thus fulfilled!  </em>The voyage took him away from the familiar scenes of his life with his willingness to ignore the dangers of a very long voyage. The bulk of the book describes the Pacific islands and other warmer and more exotic locations than the <em>Malouines </em>. Nevertheless his closely written account of visits ashore there (p 44-70 of Vol 1) and of the Falklands' flora and fauna (with occasional references to <a href=\"/biographies/pernetty_antoine-joseph\">PERNETTY</a>'s work) is interesting. The plate facing p50, captioned <em>Etablissements Français aux Iles Malouines </em>(French Settlements on the Falkland Islands) shows the tents of the <em>Coquille </em>'s observers amid the deserted buildings of <a href=\"/biographies/bougainville_louis\">BOUGAINVILLE</a>'s Port Louis. The first thing Lesson encountered there was the grave of an English mariner. He remarks on the tameness of the birds and animals of the Falklands. With Dumont d'URVILLE he walked across a stretch of level ground, which was smoking as a result of the fires lit by the sailors and not put out, towards a range of hills. He describes the great boulders, which from a distance appeared like the ruined chateaux of the French province of Dauphiné or the remains of a deserted monastery. The landscape, where troops of wild horses and cattle roamed, was dominated by Mount Chatellux {Mount Usborne}. In contrast to the bare ground of the mainland, grazed by these herds, Lesson found a taller and more flourishing vegetation on the islets, which provided shelter for seals and penguins. He makes no mention of the native fox, the warrah.</p>",

        "body": "<p>governor, was born in Dunedin, New Zealand on 26 September 1918, the son of George Henry Lewis. He was educated at Otago Boys' High School and Otago University. He served with the Second New Zealand Division in the Middle East from 1939 to 1946. He attained the rank of lieutenant-colonel, was mentioned in despatches and awarded the MBE. He joined the Colonial Service in Nigeria in 1947, and was administrator of the Turks &amp; Caicos Islands from 1955 to 1959, returning to Nigeria where he was permanent secretary to the Federal Ministry of Economic Development from 1960 to 1962. He had married Jean Margaret Smyth in 1949.</p><p>Lewis joined the CRO (subsequently FCO) in 1962 where his first appointment was as first secretary in Pakistan from 1963 to 1966. From 1966 to 1969 he served in London, becoming first secretary in Kuching, Sarawak from 1969 to 1970, after which he was appointed governor of the Falkland Islands.</p><p><strong>Governor</strong></p><p>Lewis arrived in the Islands on 8 January 1971 and left on 20 January 1975 after just over four years as governor. On his departure the <em>Falkland Island Times </em>noted that he had worked in the Islands 'during a turbulent period in world and local affairs'. In terms of the relationship with Argentina the period was certainly eventful, covering the various stages in the evolution of the Communications Agreement and the further developments which followed it. While the issue of Argentina was central, there was also some exploratory developmental activity, and against a background of fluctuating wool prices and rising costs there were successful efforts to prevent the Falklands requiring budgetary aid from the UK. There was a continual struggle to attract good professional staff from outside the Islands.</p><p><strong>The Air Link with Argentina</strong></p><p>One of Lewis's early tasks was to reveal more details of the exploratory talks held between a British delegation including three Falklands representatives and Argentina in London in July 1970, principally but not exclusively about communications, in particular the possible inauguration of an air service with the mainland. The response in the Islands was mixed, with fears expressed that such arrangements might be a preliminary to an Argentine take-over.</p><p>In the meantime there had been a report by Peat, Marwick &amp; Mitchell recommending an air service in combination with a sea service. In June 1971 DA Scott, an under-secretary in the FCO led a British delegation, again including representatives from the Islands, in further talks in Buenos Aires. This was preceded by a visit to the Islands by Scott and his FCO team during which Scott was at pains to persuade Islanders of the advantage of air links and to reassure them that any arrangements would be under 'the sovereignty umbrella'* protecting Britain's position on the sovereignty of the Islands. The result of the talks was a Joint Statement under which the Argentines would provide a regular air service to be operated by amphibian aircraft pending the building by HMG of an airfield at Port Stanley for medium range passenger aircraft. There were various important additional administrative provisions, including the unpopular 'white card' for travel by Islanders to Argentina and the offer of scholarships in Argentina to children from the Islands. A sea service by the Falkland Islands Company would also be maintained, although the <em>Darwin </em>which had traditionally provided the link with the mainland was withdrawn by FIC as uneconomic in December 1971.</p><p>The amphibian aircraft started service on 8 January 1972 but, given weather conditions, its limited payload, and high operating costs, it was soon decided to replace it with land planes. The Argentines offered to build an aluminium landing strip for this purpose. The proposal ran into local opposition mainly on the grounds that the strip would be an encroachment on sovereignty. As Lewis said in a despatch 'the local politicians, not known for their ability to stand up to pressure, immediately took cover and we found the road ahead blocked'. It took extensive touring of the settlements by Lewis and his colonial, later chief, secretary <a href=\"/biographies/layng_thomas\">LAYNG</a>, to swing Island opinion in favour of the proposal to which councillors eventually agreed unanimously. Work began in May 1972.</p><p>The opening and inaugural flight took place in November 1972. Despite the good impression created by the Argentine workforce employed on the construction of the strip, Lewis was confronted with the prospect of a demonstration on sovereignty by hardliners at the inaugural ceremony which was to be attended by numerous Argentine visitors, including press. This was only prevented by Lewis's persuasiveness, by a broadcast by a member of LegCo and by tight security measures. The ceremony went well and a further successful round of communications talks on the Islands dealt with related administrative and political problems.</p><p>Lewis's despatch of 24 November 1972 in which he had described his success in preventing the demonstration against the strip also expressed pleasure at the extent and pace of the change in the attitude of Islanders generally to the Argentines, although he acknowledged Islander concern about the proposal to have Argentina become exclusive supplier of fuel to the Falklands, what was to become known as the YPF Agreement (after the name of the Argentine state fuel company) which was beginning to be discussed. Lewis, however, was careful to warn that the 'relaxed atmosphere makes it even more important that a calculated decision is taken in the months ahead as to whether we allow the present momentum to be maintained or where a touch on the brake is necessary'.</p><p>At any event a Peronist triumph in the March 1973 Argentine elections was to produce an immediate hardening of the Argentine line. Further inter-governmental talks, largely to discuss the operation of the Communications Agreement between Britain and Argentina in April 1973, foundered. The Argentines wanted to reintroduce the 1968 Memorandum of Understanding into the discussions and to exclude Island representatives. FCO officials at the meeting were unable to accept discussions on such a basis at such short notice, needing to consult ministers.</p><p>In mid-1973 Lewis came home on leave and was asked to advise on the dilemma which now confronted HMG. As the FCO saw it, the Argentines had taken advantage of the relationship created by the Communications Agreement to manoeuvre for a breakdown by reviving the contentious 1968 plan. Argentina was trying to bring about a settlement before Island opinion had had time to evolve further in their favour. HMG on the other hand were anxious to maintain the dialogue in whatever way they could and avoid confrontation. Shortly before Lewis's meeting, scheduled by the FCO to discuss 'an acceptable method of continuing the dialogue with the Argentines over the future of the Falkland Islands', a telegram from Chief Secretary Layng arrived stating, inter alia, that 'to all but a hard core [of Islanders] pounds, shillings and pence mean more than Britishness' and suggesting that most people would in the end realise that they would be better off 'in an Argentine development area'. Determined efforts by both sides should be able to produce a formula acceptable all round. Asked about the telegram Lewis, rather surprisingly, agreed generally with it but had some reservations about its assessment of a change of heart by Islanders. He said he would have to see what people thought when he got back. He was nervous about going into talks 'with so few cards to play'.</p><p>The FCO hankered after reintroducing guarantees and safeguards as a way of keeping the Argentines in play, perhaps by way of a further discussion document, but accepted that ExCo should be consulted. Lewis felt 'quite a lot of patient discussion would be needed to persuade Islanders to keep the dialogue going on this basis and that they would not be ready to transfer their allegiance for ten or twenty years'. He rejected the possibility of a referendum which had been raised by FCO on the grounds that it would be difficult to frame the questions.</p><p>Following reference to ministers, the issue of whether there should be a discussion about guarantees and safeguards was put by Lewis to all councillors on his return stressing that HMG had no intention of influencing Islanders in any way. On 25 October 1973 councillors agreed unanimously that, though dialogue should continue, it would be wrong for HMG to take the initiative. They expressed the view that despite all the benefits of the increased contacts with Argentina a majority of Islanders would vote to stay British. Strangely, in view of the reservations, which he had expressed in London, Lewis raised the possibility of a referendum 'at some stage'.</p><p><strong>The Condominium Idea and the YPF Agreement</strong></p><p>The notion of a joint Anglo-Argentine condominium next engaged the FCO as a possible way ahead which might be acceptable to Islanders. As it happened Chief Secretary Layng had worked in the Anglo-French Condominium of the New Hebrides in the Pacific and was able to explain its workings to councillors. It was not a particularly attractive solution from an Argentine point of view and it once again ducked the sovereignty question. It was Lewis's view that the Argentines should be asked whether they would agree to talks on this basis before the idea was put to Islanders. However, with a change to a Labour Government in the UK following the General Election of February 1974, it was decided that Lewis should consult ExCo about the proposal and that he should feel able to warn them about the dangers of refusing to talk. On 7 June councillors agreed that there was no objection to preliminary talks provided that they were not expected to take part. On 11 June the proposal was put to the Argentine Foreign Minister, Vignes, who after consultation with Peron agreed to talks about a joint administration as a period of integration for Islanders before transfer of sovereignty.</p><p>Unfortunately for the FCO, the condominium idea was encountering increasing resistance in the Islands encouraged by the Falkland Islands Committee in London, formed to support Falklands interests. Both Lewis and the British Ambassador in Buenos Aires, Sir Donald Hopson, were keen that talks should take place, if necessary without Islands representation, but James <a href=\"/biographies/callaghan_leonard\">CALLAGHAN</a>, the Foreign Secretary, thought there was no point in proceeding without Islander participation. Sadly, Hopson died before he could give the Argentines this information and it was uncertain whether his deputy had made the changed position plain. At any rate it was pursued no further. The FCO's next bright idea, leaseback, only gathered momentum after Lewis's departure.</p><p>In the meantime, steps towards implementation of the YPF Agreement were taking place, apparently without regard to the stand-off in general relations with Argentina. The Argentines had proposed in September 1973 that their state oil company YPF should supply petroleum products to the Islands at mainland prices on a monopoly basis. They already had a tank farm to supply fuel to the Argentine aircraft operating from the strip and were prepared to build further bulk storage facilities. To ease things, an agreement had been signed in September 1974 to place all commercial transactions with Argentina under a 'sovereignty umbrella'. Lewis had gone to considerable lengths to defend the proposed agreement in his address to LegCo on 4 January 1974. He particularly stressed the price advantage, a likely drop in the price of petrol from 82 pence to 36 pence a gallon, and in diesel from 32 to 23 pence. He said 'The Government, quite frankly, does not like monopolies or economic dominance by any company but we do have to face the facts of life.' The Falkland Islands Company who had long collaborated with the Ministry of Defence in supplying most of the fuel in the Islands were deeply opposed to the change and protested to HMG, with the support of the Falkland Islands Committee, that councillors had been misled and that the installation was unsafe. Their objections were overtaken by the change of Government in London in February 1974. Both the Argentine and the UK Governments appear to have been equally keen to sign the Agreement despite the deterioration in their relations. Lewis emphasised to LegCo the role of the Agreement in strengthening relations with Argentina. It certainly strengthened Argentina's economic influence and involvement in the Falklands.</p><p><strong>Administration and Development</strong></p><p>Lewis did not allow himself to be distracted by external affairs from taking an active interest in the internal government of the Falklands. It appears that he had been given a brief by the FCO to modernise FIG. He began by focussing on the Falklands' difficult financial plight 'caught in the classic squeeze situation of falling prices' for their sole export, wool, and 'rising prices for imports (Legco 17 May 1971), resulting in regular budget deficits and reliance on their reserves to balance the books'. He spoke of the need to scrutinise estimates of expenditure more closely than hitherto and 'to take a fresh, hard look at all established institutions'. The wool price rose steadily from the catastrophic figure of 33·5 pence per kilo in 1971 to 110·5 pence per kilo in 1974 but Lewis continued throughout his time to argue for budgetary stringency. In particular he emphasised the undesirability of allowing the Falklands to require grant in aid from the UK, underlining the degree of scrutiny which this would involve. By the time he left, the Falklands were producing a budgetary surplus, avoiding the need to plunder their reserves and banishing the spectre of grant in aid. This was partly the result of better wool prices but, more significantly, reflected increased revenues, unpopular but necessary increases in taxation and better control of costs.</p><p>The modernisation process involved both financial prudence and organisational and administrative change. The chief secretary was relatively young and had a remit to support Lewis in his modernisation brief. This he did with great energy, attracting an unpopularity which Lewis seems generally to have avoided. Lewis paid tribute to him (LegCo, 4 June 1974) for 'having done so much to streamline the administration of the Government machine and improve its efficiency'. The Stanley Town Council was abolished and its tasks distributed amongst other departments. The Medical Department was centralised in Stanley with the introduction of the equivalent of a flying doctor service and Darwin Secondary School was closed, to be replaced by a boarding hostel. Virtually all FIG departments were examined by experts supplied by the Overseas Development Administration.</p><p>It was not all pain. Farms benefited from the first Five Year Development Plan under which grants were made as fencing subsidies to improve land management. Lewis was personally instrumental in promoting the Sedgwick Report, by another overseas expert, which reviewed and increased civil service salaries by between 17% and 40% to keep up with the cost of living, though its recommendation that civil servants should no longer be entitled to leave passages to the UK but only to the mainland was unpopular. Lewis helped to introduce the Overseas Service Aid Scheme to the Falklands which paid inducements to expatriate professionals and specialists, enabling the Islands to attract much needed doctors, teachers, nurses and technical experts.</p><p>After a year in office Lewis decided that the Falklands practice of having joint meetings of the Executive and Legislative Councils would cease and the two Councils should in future have separate meetings. He thought the joint system inhibited public debate in LegCo because so much had been decided in meetings of Joint Council. He also urged ExCo members to be more forthright in defending policies which they had agreed rather than taking refuge in the confidentiality of their meetings.</p><p>Economic progress, as always in the Falklands, was to some extent an affair of false starts, wheels reinvented and hopes deferred. A major disappointment of Lewis's time was Alginate Industries' decision not to pursue their scheme for large-scale kelp processing but trial fishing by Taiyo began and high hopes rested on a report by Dr Leslie Stewart on the prospects for an inland trout fishery. A first consignment of 20,000 sheep was exported to the mainland. A new power station was opened in Stanley. There were promising increases in the number of tourists. Most important of all was probably the eventual commitment of £4·2 million by British Aid for the building of Stanley Airport, a commitment under the Communications Agreement with Argentina.</p><p>In general Lewis appears to have coped well with the successive changes and chances of his period of office. Invariably loyal to FCO policy on Argentina as the FCO twisted and turned to keep the Argentines in play, he seems to have gone to considerable pains to explain the rationale for each new step to Islanders, albeit making a virtue of necessity. Whilst doing everything possible to run the Islands better, he appeared genuinely to think that contact and collaboration with Argentina on the lines of the Communications Agreement was the best way ahead. He was at the same time mindful of Islands opinion and firm on sovereignty. As he said in LegCo on 4 January 1974 'I stand for a community which, while safeguarding its sovereignty, is prepared to play its part in the world, particularly with our closest neighbour, Argentina, and with other countries in the great Latin American continent.'</p><p>Lewis was deaf and described as having 'managed this with utmost diplomacy and skill', seemingly sometimes using it to advantage. He was generally liked, an excellent host who enjoyed entertaining with his wife, known as 'Lady Lou'. Although he appeared frail, he took early morning walks on the racecourse where he despatched golf balls hither and yon with great gusto.</p><p>He returned to the FCO as head of the Gibraltar and General Department, retiring in 1977. He was appointed OBE in 1958 and CMG in 1972. His wife died in 2003 and he died in London on 29 December 2006.</p>",

        "body": "<p>Swedish explorer and tour operator, was born in Stockholm on 23 January 1927. His father was a wine expert in the Swedish Liquor Monopoly, and his mother was the daughter of a master cabinet-maker. He was a voracious reader from the age of seven, becoming fascinated by explorers and especially the Swedes Sven Hedin and Nils <a href=\"/biographies/nordenskjold_nils\">NORDENSKJÖLD</a>. After university in Switzerland, he had planned to work in the steel industry, but a summer job with Thomas Cook in Stockholm changed his mind. He felt confined in Sweden, however, and at the age of 24 emigrated to the wider horizons of the United States, where he obtained a job with American Express on the very day he arrived in New York in 1951. In due course he became a US citizen.</p><p>Lindblad's career really took off when he founded his own company, Lindblad Travel, Inc., in 1958. His good fortune was that in those days American tourists were travelling to only a handful of safe, familiar countries. Lindblad's earliest dreams had been of remote and exotic destinations, and he had a passionate and restless desire to explore these distant lands. His enthusiasm easily persuaded others to feel the same way. Over the years his company pioneered the concept of expedition travel, and opened up an extraordinary variety of faraway and often unlikely places to well-heeled tourists. His tours were not cheap because he did not believe in discomfort unless there was no alternative, but from the very beginning he offered imaginative itineraries combined with stimulating lectures and knowledgeable guides.</p><p>His interest in the Falkland Islands was sparked in 1968 when the Falklands naturalist Ian Strange called at his office in New York, at the suggestion of the renowned bird artist Roger Tory Peterson. Lindblad was not there but the seeds of interest were sown and Lindblad asked Strange to set up a visit to the Falklands for his chartered cruise ship, the <em>Navarino </em>, in 1968. This was a former Chilean navy ship, converted for passenger use, and was not ideal but it served its purpose and the first-ever tourist cruise of the Falkland Islands was a great success. Ian Strange and his wife Maria had made the local arrangements, choosing West Point and Carcass Islands for passenger landings.</p><p>Meanwhile, a very special ship was taking shape in a Finnish shipyard. The <em>Lindblad Explorer </em>, purpose-built for out of the way and unusual destinations, was relatively small, ice-strengthened, and fitted with bow-thrusters for manoeuvrability and evaporators for ensuring ample supplies of fresh water. Most important was the small fleet of rubber Zodiac landing craft which enabled passengers to land anywhere in the world, without the need for a dock. This single idea undoubtedly revolutionized cruising to remote places. And that included the Falkland Islands.</p><p>After an eventful maiden voyage during which the <em>Lindblad Explorer </em>caught fire in mid-Atlantic, and had to enter dry dock in Montevideo for extensive repairs, the ship departed Punta Arenas, Chile, in February 1970 on a sub-Antarctic cruise bound for the Falkland Islands, South Georgia, Gough Island, Tristan da Cunha, and finally Cape Town. Aboard were a team of lecturers including Roger Tory Peterson, Robert Cushman <a href=\"/biographies/murphy_robert\">MURPHY</a>, an eminent American biologist, and Keith Shackleton, the British marine and wildlife artist.</p><p>The ship was given a very warm welcome in Stanley where people invited the passengers into their homes. In return Lindblad arranged a buffet lunch in the cathedral hall for over 400 Islanders. He then invited some eighty 'leaders', including the governor, Sir Cosmo <a href=\"/biographies/haskard_cosmo\">HASKARD</a>, to dinner on board the ship. This had its funny side. During cocktails Lindblad had discovered that the main dish was to be lamb, which he knew was hardly a treat in the Falklands. The frenzied efforts to substitute steak for lamb were successful, but must have distracted Lindblad, who managed to welcome 'all of you from the Galápagos Islands' in his speech. This <em>faux pas </em>was greeted with roars of laughter. He gamely carried on and finished his speech, only to end by making exactly the same mistake. As he sat down amid further friendly laughter, the governor rose to respond. Taking the microphone, he said 'As Her Majesty's representative at the Gilbert and Ellice Islands, I'd like to thank the nice Mr Blomqvist for his hospitality and welcome his new ship, the <em>Beagle </em>.'</p><p>The next stop was a memorable first visit by a cruise ship to South Georgia, where 25 British Antarctic Survey staff came aboard for dinner, and willingly repaid their hosts' hospitality by guiding the passengers on their trips ashore.</p><p>Lindblad's cruises to the Falkland Islands continued over the years, often combined with Antarctic cruises, and have been copied by an increasing number of other companies. He would be pleased that the smaller vessels making landings at places like Carcass, West Point, and New Island, as well as Stanley, still follow the Lindblad pattern of combining conservation-conscious travel with adventure, pleasure and learning, the latter provided by specialist lecturers. And he would be especially proud that his son's company, Lindblad Expeditions, is a leading exponent of this type of low-impact travel.</p><p>Unfortunately, towards the end of his career Lindblad's passionate belief that travel leads to understanding and thus to peace was his undoing. Tours to Cambodia and Vietnam in 1987-89 had violated the United States Trading with the Enemy Act, and the legal costs of defending his actions caused Lindblad Travel to close. Lindblad was unrepentant: 'To embargo travel is like burning books or imprisoning journalists.'</p><p>Lindblad received a host of honours and awards. The King of Sweden made him a Knight of the North Star, and Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands awarded him the Order of the Golden Ark. He was elected to the Hall of Fame of the American Association of Travel Agents, while the American Express Company gave him a special trophy. He was an innovative pioneer who was described by the President of the United States Tour Operators' Association as 'probably one of the most creative people who was ever involved in organizing travel'. He was also the father of Falklands' tourism.</p><p>Lars-Eric Lindblad married Sonja Buschinker in 1948, and had one son, Sven-Olof. Divorced in 1979, he married Cary Ann Butera, who died in 1984. He married Ruriko Hosaka in 1986. He also had two daughters, Cristina and Ana-Maria, with Esperanza Rivaud. He died of a heart attack, by coincidence in Stockholm, the city of his birth, on 8 July 1994. Some of his ashes were placed under some endemic Felton's flowers in the garden of Roddy and Lily Napier at West Point Island.</p>",

He accompanied his mother, and his eldest sister Elizabeth Amelie Louisa, who was married to Colonial Surgeon Henry <a href=\"/biographies/hamblin_henry\">HAMBLIN</a>, when the family travelled to the Islands in 1843, arriving on the brigantine <em>Columbian Packet </em>on 23 November. He was soon appointed by Governor <a href=\"/biographies/moody_richard\">MOODY</a> to the post of government clerk and rapidly made his mark as a conscientious - if slightly officious - civil servant. He was present at the scene in Government House between Moody and Murrell <a href=\"/biographies/robinson_murrell\">ROBINSON</a> in April 1845 and contributed a deposition to the records. Moody wrote to the Colonial Office on his own departure in 1848 proposing to combine the posts of storekeeper and accountant with that of Colonial Secretary and to put Longden in charge:</p><blockquote><blockquote>For 4 and a half years I have had the closest opportunity of judging this gentleman's capabilities. He has worked with me personally during the whole of that time and is well acquainted with every branch I have hitherto performed, together with the Instructions and schooling I have myself received in the above branches. Of his business-like habits, ready talents, steady industry and estimable character it is but my duty to speak in the very highest terms.</blockquote></blockquote><p>In 1851, Governor <a href=\"/biographies/rennie_george\">RENNIE</a> asked that Longden's pay be increased from £200 pa to £300: minuting in the Colonial Office supported his request, but noted that it came too late for the estimates. Longden was on board the <em>Levenside </em>when she sank on the Billy Rock off Cape Pembroke on her return from New Island - embarrassingly the ExCo minute book, which he was writing up, was lost. In November 1859, Governor Moore forwarded a request by Longden for promotion to the secretary of state, with a warm endorsement.</p><p>In 1861 he was appointed to the highest grade of the Colonial Service as president of the Virgin Islands and became successively lieutenant governor of Dominica and British Honduras{Belize}, before becoming governor of Trinidad in 1870. He was then made governor of British Guiana {Guyana}, before being appointed governor of Ceylon {Sri Lanka} in 1876. He retired from that post in 1883. In his retirement he settled in Hertfordshire and took an interest in the affairs of the county, becoming a magistrate and an alderman. He was awarded the KCMG in 1876 and the GCMG in 1883. Longden was married in the West Indies around 1865 to Alice, who came from St Kitts. The 1891 census found him at home at Longhope near Watford with his wife and five children: Alice (aged 24), Ethel Louisa (21), Chapman (17), Horace (14) and Elizabeth (8). He died at Longhope in October 1891.</p><p>Essentially an administrator, he provided continuity and good management in Government House during the early years of the colony. Not an adventurous soul, he was nicknamed 'Wait-a-bit Jim' in Ceylon. He is remembered by Mount Longdon - the spelling somehow changed - the site of the 1982 battle.</p>",

Apart from time as a Royal Naval chaplain, 1866-70 and chaplain in the Falklands, 1872-76, Lory served in thirteen other parishes between 1863 and 1878. To be an assistant priest in parish after parish would suggest that Lory had an unusual character, as does his inability to stay long in one place.</p><p>He arrived in the Islands in January 1872 as a locum replacing the Rev Charles <a href=\"/biographies/bull_charles\">BULL</a> who would depart for England with his wife in April on leave. Lory was a somewhat querulous individual, who found fault with a number of different matters: the arrival of the Catholic priest Fr William Mason <a href=\"/biographies/walsh_william\">WALSH</a> on a pastoral visit, the perception that Governor <a href=\"/biographies/darcy_george\">D'ARCY</a> was liberal in his attitude and actions towards the Catholic community, the activities of Caroline D'Arcy (the Governor's wife) whom he regarded as a 'pervert' because of her conversion to Catholicism, his own miserable economic situation and his wife's health. The situation was alarming for Lory as he was only the locum or caretaker colonial chaplain. A growing Roman Catholic congregation in Stanley might be construed as a failure of his ministry. Lory maintained a voluminous correspondence with Dr Archibald Campbell Tait, the archbishop of Canterbury. By letter of 25 September 1874 Lory advised Tait that 'the small stipend on which I have been detailed is altogether inadequate for the support of myself and family...My arrears are £40....I came here with the hope of bettering myself not supposing that I should be almost ruined'. His wife Georgina Henrietta, daughter of the Rev John Webster Hawksley, was admitted to Wonford Lunatic Asylum in August 1871 on the authority of her husband, suffering from 'puerperal mania' (post-natal depression). She would remain there until released into the custody of her father in January 1876. Georgina Lory's term of internment practically coincided with her husband's stay in the Falklands. Lory wrote constantly concerning his situation to secretaries of state, Lords Kimberley and Carnarvon, and would be reprimanded by the latter for breaching protocol by not forwarding his letters via the Governor. Lory wrote three theological books, all published in London between 1871 and 1883.</p>",

He entered the Navy in January 1806 as a first class volunteer on board the 98 gun  <em>Prince of Wales, </em>possibly because his eldest brother Henry was serving on board. After serving in a succession of ships, including the  <em>Favourite </em>, commanded by his brother Henry, in 1813, he was promoted to lieutenant in 1815. On 4 June 1816 Lowcay married Mary Ann Woodnutt in St Mary, Portsea. He then served in various ships as a lieutenant until 13 February 1837 when he was appointed in command of the 10 gun ketch  <em>Sparrow </em>on the South American station. In November 1837 the Commander at Río, Admiral Hamond, sent Lowcay to the Falklands to relieve Lieutenant Henry <a href=\"/biographies/smith_henry\">SMITH</a>, the naval officer in charge at Port Louis, and to report on the Islands, taking with him sheep, fowls and seed for the settlement.</p><p>On his arrival in Port Louis, on 30 November 1837, Lowcay found only Smith, one of his boat's crew, a German tailor, a French gardener and three women; the other inhabitants were absent sealing in the schooner  <em>Montgomery.  </em>One of Lowcay's first tasks was to inform the master of the French whaler  <em>La Perseverance  </em>that the British government asserted in the strongest manner their sovereignty over the Falkland Islands and their right to prevent foreign vessels from fishing within three miles of the shore and that cattle, horses and wild animals were protected. Subsequently  <em>La Perseverance </em>was wrecked near New Island, the survivors being taken to Río de Janeiro in the  <em>Montgomery </em>.</p><p>In December Lowcay cruised round the Islands in an anticlockwise direction to assert British sovereignty and warn foreign vessels from sealing, whaling and hunting the wild cattle. He took with him Charles <a href=\"/biographies/melville_charles\">MELVILLE</a>, one of Smith's boat's crew, as pilot, returning to Berkeley Sound on 31 December.</p><p>During 1838 Lowcay returned three times to Río de Janeiro. On 13 December he arrived back in Berkeley Sound on the same day as Lieutenant <a href=\"/biographies/sulivan_sir\">SULIVAN</a> arrived in the  <em>Arrow </em>to survey the islands. Sulivan reported that Lowcay was living at the time in one of two small houses in Port Louis, while Lauchlan <a href=\"/biographies/mackinnon_laughlan\">MACKINNON</a>, mate of the  <em>Arrow </em>, noted that there were in addition three or four mud huts occupied by gauchos and their families, plus 200 tame cattle. <em> </em>In March 1839 Lowcay sent the  <em>Sparrow  </em>on a short visit to Gregory Bay (Bahía Gregorio), in the Strait of Magellan in an unsuccessful attempt to obtain horses. He himself sailed for Río de Janeiro for the last time in August 1839 and on his arrival there on 17 November he was superseded by Lieutenant John <a href=\"/biographies/tyssen_john\">TYSSEN</a>.</p><p>During his time in the Falklands all the good work done by Smith was allowed to deteriorate. By the time Tyssen relieved Lowcay, only twelve lassoing horses were left and the number of tamed cattle had fallen to 160. In a report to Lord Minto, first lord of the admiralty, Lowcay reported that the winter of 1839 was particularly severe; all the high land was covered in snow and drifting snow lay in the hollows for three weeks.</p><p>After several appointments in home waters, on 16 March 1844 Lowcay was appointed senior lieutenant on board the  <em>Bonetta </em>, carrying out surveys in the eastern Mediterranean. This appointment, however, was very short as in November he was relieved and placed on half-pay. He died, still a lieutenant, in 1853.</p>",

He joined the Royal Marines and whilst serving on HMS <em>Hero</em> was valet to the Prince of Wales (later King Edward VII) during the Prince’s visit to North America in 1860. By November 1863 he was sailing from England on the <em>Velocidade</em> with a detachment of  20 marines under the command of Lieutenant GH Elliot, bound for the Falkland Islands. Arriving in January 1864 they took over from the troops of the Falkland Islands Company which was commanded by Captain Molony. It was not a happy posting. A matter of two months later Elliot was complaining to the Governor about the problem of the detachment having to cut and haul peat for use in the barracks. By 1865 the stipendiary magistrate was writing to the governor that ‘Our garrison of Royal Marines has never been equal to its duties owing to its small numbers. Since then two members have been sent home and with the additional loss of one now under confinement allowing also for illness and other contingencies the detachment is at this moment very nearly useless’.</p><p>William Luxton returned briefly to Devon to marry Mary Ann White (1834-1917) at St Sidwell, Exeter on 25 September 1869. He returned to the Islands with his family in early 1869, and worked for the Dean family. They had three children, John Thomas (1870-1934), Beatrice Mary (1872-1895) and William Henry (1877-1952). Luxton died in 1881. It seems likely that Mary Ann Luxton was already working as domestic help for Mrs Orissa <a href=\"/biographies/dean_orissa\">DEAN</a> who, with her husband George, took the family under their wing. When George Markham Dean died in 1888, Mrs Dean continued to care for the family. She had had no children, and she cared and provided for the fatherless Luxton children as if they had been her own.</p><p><strong>The Second Generation</strong></p><p>John Luxton married Mary Jane Sharp (1874-1950) in 1895. He had trained as a cabinet maker in England and was also a portrait photographer. They had five children, George Thomas (1896-1902), Markham James (1898-1974) who married Winifred Dorothy Newing and had two daughters Joyce Orissa (b1928) and Ariel Lorna Bessie (b1931), Stanley Charles (1903-1961) who married Isabella Short and had one son (Henry Thomas 1927-1979) and two daughters Ada Isobel (b1930) and Ursula Mary (b1932), Orissa Mary Jane (1907-1957) who married Edward McAtasney, and Ernest Falkland (1911-1999) who married Sybil Grace Binnie and had three sons, John Thomas (b1934), David Kerry (b1944) and Robin (b1952). This family was based in Stanley, and most now live either in England or New Zealand, but there are a few descendants resident in the Falklands today.</p><p>Beatrice Luxton married William Lewis of Keppel Island in 1892. Her daughter Orissa (1893-1986) was born in 1893 and her son Markham in 1895.  Beatrice died ten days after the boy was born and the children were brought to Stanley to Orissa Dean and their Luxton grandmother. In due course William Lewis, who had gone to farm in Patagonia, remarried and took his son back there, where the Lewis family is to be found today. Orissa Lewis remained with Mrs Dean.  In 1916, she married Reginald Carew <a href=\"?q=node/373\">POLE-EVANS</a> who was the manager of Port Howard station and they had two sons, Douglas Markham <a href=\"?q=node/372\">POLE-EVANS</a> (1917-1992), Anthony Reginald (b1919), and a daughter Audrey Orissa (1918-1975). Most of their descendants are living in the Falklands today.</p><p>William Henry Luxton married firstly Agnes Maud Smith (1882-1920) in 1901.( Agnes Maud died in 1920 and in 1933 he married Constance Miller. They had one son, Peter (b1935).) William and Agnes Maud had three children: Beatrice Orissa Maud (1902-1974) who married Hugh Cullen <a href=\"?q=node/230\">HARDING</a>; Viola Mary (1906-1973) who married Howard Wickham <a href=\"?q=node/116\">CLEMENT</a> and had two daughters, Sally Gwynfa (b1942) and Judith Orissa (b1945 and Keith William Edwin (1908-1977) who married firstly Betty Hamilton and had a son William Robert, (b1940) and a daughter Lynne Faye (1942-1946). Keith’s wife Betty died in 1951 and he married Margaret Hodges in 1952. They had one daughter Jennifer Mary (b1953).</p><p>This is a family of farmers. William Henry Luxton started work at Port Stephens and then moved to Chartres,  both of which were Dean properties. He inherited a two third share of Chartres station from Orissa Dean, and subsequently his grandson William Robert (Bill) bought the remaining third. Both of his daughters married farmers, and his eldest son Keith and then his grandson Bill farmed Chartres after him.</p><p>Several members of the family served on LegCo, the first being William Henry in 1929. Keith William was a Legislative Councillor in 1948, and again in 1952 when he was joined on Council by his cousin Stanley Charles. Keith was an Executive Councillor in 1955.

        "body": " <p>American naval officer, was born in Norfolk, Virginia on 1 April 1801. Appointed a midshipman in the US Navy on 26 January 1819, Lynch was first assigned to the frigate  <em>Congress,  </em>then served in the schooner  <em>Shark </em>, on the West African coast, followed by service in Commodore David Porter's 'Mosquito Squadron' and its anti-piracy campaign in the West Indies in 1827-29. Promoted to lieutenant in 1828, he was placed on inactive service for a number of years, then briefly held his first command in 1839. Returning to active service again, he was at the capture of Vera Cruz during the War with Mexico in 1847.</p><p>Lynch applied for permission to promote the cause of scientific and Christian truth by circumnavigating and exploring the Dead Sea. Intrigued by the idea, which complemented other scientific work in progress, Secretary of the Navy John Y Mason ordered Lynch to take the store ship USS  <em>Supply  </em>to the Mediterranean during 1847-8. Lynch then proceeded overland with two metal lifeboats which were launched on the Sea of Galilee, went down the River Jordan, and circumnavigated the Dead Sea. On his return in 1849, Lynch was promoted to commander and published his first book, a popular account of his adventures,  <em>Narrative of the U.S. Expedition to the River Jordan and the Dead Sea  </em>which had seven American and two British editions. He also published a partly autobiographical book in 1851,  <em>Naval Life; or Observations Afloat and on Shore,  </em>which revealed his deep religious convictions. This was followed by  <em>The Official Report of the U.S. Expedition,  </em>published by the US Naval Observatory in 1852.</p><p>In 1853, the Secretary of the Navy ordered Lynch to undertake an expedition to the west coat of Africa but illness obliged him to return to the United States. In November 1853, he was appointed to command the sloop of war  <em>Germantown </em>of 1000 tons with 16 long heavy 32 pdr guns, and 6 larger 64 pdr. He arrived on the Brazil Station for duty under Commodore WD Salter in January 1854. At Montevideo, Salter dispatched  <em>Germantown  </em>to the Falkland Islands on 18 February, following reports that the ship  <em>Hudson,  </em>Captain Hiram CLIFT <em>,  </em>and her consort, the whaling schooner  <em>Washington,  </em>William Eldridge, both of Mystic, Connecticut, were poaching. Arriving off Stanley on 2 March, Lynch first encountered the  <em>Washington  </em>entering harbour with a lieutenant and men on board from HM Brig  <em>Express,  </em>Commander Henry <a href=\"/biographies/boys_henry\">BOYS</a>, bringing the masters of the American vessels in for trial. Outraged at what he took to be an illegal seizure, Lynch immediately protested only to learn directly from Governor George <a href=\"/biographies/rennie_george\">RENNIE</a> and subsequently from US Secretary of State WS Marcy that the State Department had issued a notice to American mariners that they would be liable to punishment by the Falkland Islands' civil authorities for committing depredations on the coast of the Islands. However, Lynch's immediate reaction was to accuse Commander Boys of 'an audacious seizure', 'a quasi-act of war', and 'a violation of the territory of the United States'. Lynch investigated the events closely, displaying his guns within range of both the shore battery and  <em>Express </em>and exchanging an acrid correspondence over legal points with both Governor Rennie and Commander Boys. Coming to believe that the Falklands government was attempting to break up the American seal and whale fisheries in the South Atlantic, Lynch declared: 'The <em> </em>U States, ample in their domain, prefer no claim to these inhospitable rocks &amp; bogs; but their government will, if I mistake not, maintain the unrestricted rights of its citizens to use the uninhabited islands of this group for the purposes of fishery, &amp; refreshment of their vessels, and to navigate the bays, &amp; straits &amp; circumjacent seas'. On 7 March, Captain Clift appeared in court, confessed, and took responsibility on behalf of both vessels for unlawfully killing 22 wild pigs. The chief justice fined him the minimum £1 per animal and £5/16s court costs, upon payment of which the vessels and men were released and quickly sailed for home. Two weeks later, Lynch terminated his correspondence abruptly and sailed on 20 March for Montevideo, where he published his view of the events in the newspaper  <em>Comercio del Plata  </em>of 4 April 1854, to counter the British interpretation. In support of Lynch, the United States formally lodged an objection to the seizure and demanded reparations of $39,000 for the owners for their claimed commercial losses due to the detention.</p><p>In August 1854, Lynch returned to Stanley to inquire into the case of an American, Captain Bernsee, who was being prosecuted for selling the wreck of his barque,  <em>Courier </em>, without permission. He only stayed two days.</p><p>Lynch remained in  <em>Germantown </em>until February 1857, protecting American property during civil unrest in the area around Montevideo, twice landing his contingent of Marines in 1855. Promoted to captain, he published a lecture,  <em>Commerce and the Holy Land  </em>(1860), <em> </em>in which he argued that the preferred route to Asia laid through the Mediterranean not the Pacific.</p><p>In April 1861 at the outbreak of the American Civil War, he resigned his commission in the US Navy to serve his home state as a captain in the Virginia Navy and was soon commissioned a captain in the Confederate States Navy. During the war he commanded the naval batteries at Aquia Creek, Virginia, in 1861, then commanded the naval defences in the waters of Virginia and North Carolina, participated in the defence of Roanoke Island in February 1862, before commanding, as commodore, the Mississippi River defences at Vicksburg in March to October 1862. He returned to command the North Carolina naval defences in 1862-64. In 1865, he was captured by Federal forces and paroled. Six months after the end of the war, he died at Baltimore, Maryland, on 17 October 1865.</p><p>In 1965, the US Navy named the oceanographic research vessel USS  <em>Lynch  </em>(AGOR-7) in recognition of Lynch's contributions to naval exploration.</p>",

He was promoted captain on 5 June 1856 and placed on half pay and by 1862 he was on reserved half pay; retired captain 1 July 1867.</p><p>Mackenzie was one of a number of naval captains considered for the governorship of the Falklands, and was appointed governor on 24 September 1862. He arrived in the colony with his wife Martha Catherine, via Río de Janeiro on board HMS <em>Satellite </em>on 22 November and was sworn in on Monday 24 November 1862.</p><p>From contemporary source documents Mackenzie seems to have governed calmly and quietly during his four year. Surprisingly he receives little mention in any of the standard books on Falklands history but, although a number of significant events and incidents took place during his period of office, he was personally involved in scarcely anything more dramatic than a furore over the seating arrangements in Holy Trinity Church. Indeed in a letter to the secretary of state about Bishop <a href=\"/biographies/stirling_waite\">STIRLING</a>, who had berated the Governor for not mixing more with the people of Stanley, Mackenzie wrote: 'I had found such a system of lying and quarrelling to prevail among them [the people of Stanley] that I found it prudent to withdraw'.</p><p>Following instructions from Mackenzie's predecessor, Governor <a href=\"/biographies/moore_thomas\">MOORE</a>, the Falkland Islands Company (FIC) had been prosecuted in Stanley for illegally killing wild cattle without the Governor's permission and had been fined £1,080. The Company had appealed to the Privy Council in Britain and, although the appeal had not yet been heard, in January 1863 Governor Mackenzie received instructions from the the secretary of state to repay £830 to the Company, reducing the fine to £250. Finally in August 1863 the Privy Council gave judgement in favour of the Falkland Islands Company.</p><p>In 1864 Mackenzie was at last able to make a tour of the Islands when Rear Admiral Warren, commander-in-chief on the Brazil station placed a small steamer, HMS <em>Stromboli </em>, at his disposal and from 16 to 27 March together with the colonial secretary, <a href=\"/biographies/pyne_william\">PYNE</a>, he managed to visit every Camp station. He reported to the Duke of Newcastle that in his opinion 'the whole country, particularly the West Falkland and adjacent islands, is peculiarly valuable for pastoral purposes and in the meanwhile I shall endeavour my utmost to encourage sheep farming, which I am convinced will eventually prove a source of wealth to the Colony'.</p><p>In July 1864 it came to the Governor's notice that a scheme had been organised to destroy the penguin rookeries at Volunteer Lagoon and an organised party travelling there in several boats indiscriminately slaughtered the 'animals'. Fearing wholesale destruction of penguins throughout the colony to meet the demand for valuable penguin oil on the London market, the governor had a bill drafted to protect the penguins on Crown lands or lands leased from the Crown. The ordinance was passed by LegCo in September of that year (which imposed a maximum fine of £100 and the confiscation of any boats used), but ran into problems with the Colonial Office, who considered a fine should not exceed £5 for each day's slaughter plus £1 per bird killed: the ordinance had to be suspended. As the governor pointed out in a letter to the Colonial Office in October 1865, a party of three men without using much exertion could easily kill £1,500 to £2,000 worth of penguins in one day!</p><p>For years Falkland Islands governors had complained about the carriage of despatches and the mails between England and the Falkland Islands. The problem was solved, at least for the time being, by the purchase in October 1863 of the 84 ton yacht <em>Foam </em>by the British Government Emigration Board, for the carriage of mails between the Falkland Islands and Montevideo. The yacht duly arrived at Port Stanley after a voyage of sixty days under her skipper, Captain Smithen. The <em>Foam </em>, making six return passages annually, maintained the Falklands mail link via Montevideo without incident until 1872.</p><p>In 1864 a detachment of Royal Marines under the command of Lieutenant GH Elliot replaced the army Falkland Islands Company (FICoy)</p><p>Members of ExCo expressed their opinion that after the four years administration by Governor Mackenzie 'the Colony seemed at last to have taken a start on the road to improvement', that the rent roll had nearly doubled (instead of nineteen grazing stations there were now thirty-seven), that imports and exports showed a very satisfactory condition of trade, that there had been a great increase in the number of shipping visiting the port for repairs and provisions and, above all, there was the establishment of regular bi-monthly mail communication with Montevideo by means of the schooner <em>Foam </em>.</p><p>In 1866, Mackenzie was appointed lieutenant-governor of St Christopher and on 4 July he left the Falklands on HMS <em>Spiteful </em>which had arrived at Stanley with the new governor, William <a href=\"/biographies/robinson_sir\">ROBINSON</a>. On 1 January 1875 he was promoted rear-admiral on the retired list and he died on 25 February 1879.</p>",

When in 1770 news reached Buenos Aires of the British settlement in Port Egmont, Governor Francisco de Paula Bucarelli y Ursua assembled a squadron of five frigates, under the command of <em>Capitán de navio </em>Juan Ignacio Madariaga in the frigate <em>Industria </em>and a contingent of 300 men of the Regiment of Majorca with additional troops from Buenos Aires, to evict the British. Madariaga entered Port Egmont alone in the <em>Industria </em>on 4 June 1770 and at first merely asked for water, being as he explained from Buenos Aires en route for Puerto de Soledad (Port Louis). Three days later, in bitter wintry weather, the remaining four frigates entered the harbour. These were the <em>Santa Catalina </em>, commanded by Fernando Rubalcava and the <em>Andalucía </em>, Domingo Perletto, which had entered Port Egmont the previous February, accompanied by the <em>Santa Bárbara </em>, José Díaz Veanez, and the <em>Santa Rosa, </em>Francisco <a href=\"/biographies/gil_de\">GIL</a>.

On 8 June Farmer wrote to Madariaga requesting him to leave since he had received the water he had asked for. Madariaga countered by inviting Farmer to view his troops, which he did the following evening. The Spaniard then wrote to the two British officers warning them to leave Port Egmont, which they declined. The next morning, 10 June, Spanish troops were landed near the settlement. After a few desultory shots from both sides, seeing the impossibility of defence against such a force, Farmer was forced to accept the inevitable and asked for terms of surrender, which were granted. Madariaga then took possession of Port Egmont. One of the articles of capitulation had been that the <em>Favourite </em>could carry away with her all she could and depart as soon as she was ready for sea. But the Spaniards detained her rudder until the middle of July, when she departed, leaving Madariaga in full possession of Port Egmont.</p>",

        "body": "<p>Spanish naval officer, was born on 5 November 1754 in the tiny hamlet of Mulazzo in NW Italy, the younger son of the Marquis Carlo Malaspina and Catarina Meli Lupi di Soragno di Parma. As he was unlikely to inherit either the family lands or title, Malaspina was forced to look elsewhere for a career. In 1765 he enrolled in the Collegio Clementino in Rome, perhaps destined for the church, but he decided instead to enlist in the Spanish navy, not unusual in those days for Italians with military ambitions. He entered the navy as a  <em>guardiamarina </em>in 1774, promotion soon followed and in June 1786, he was appointed as a  <em>capitan de fregata  </em>in command of the frigate  <em>Astrea,  </em>in which he visited ports on the east and west coasts of South America and Manila in the Philippines before returning to Cadiz via the Cape of Good Hope. On his return to Spain, Malaspina and his friend José <a href=\"/biographies/bustamante_y\">BUSTAMANTE</a> drew up a plan for a scientific and political voyage around the world, partly modelled on that of Captain <a href=\"/biographies/cook_james\">COOK</a>. The aim of the expedition was to produce hydrographic charts for parts of the Americas under Spanish jurisdiction and to investigate the political state of Spanish possessions, recording their trade, natural resources and defence. The plan was submitted to Spain's Minister of Marine on 10 September 1788 and approved by King Carlos III one month later.</p><p><strong>The Scientific Expedition</strong></p><p>Although only thirty-three years old, Malaspina was given command of the expedition, with full powers to chose its officers and scientific staff. Two specially designed corvettes, named the  <em>Descubierta </em>and  <em>Atrevida, </em>were built in Cadiz during the following nine months. At the same time the necessary instruments were purchased abroad, principally in London, while a comprehensive team of scientists and artists was assembled. The expedition sailed from Cadiz on 30 July 1789 with Malaspina in command of the  <em>Descubierta </em>and Bustamante in command of the  <em>Atrevida </em>. Malaspina anchored off Montevideo on 20 September, where the next seven weeks were spent on a variety of tasks, including surveys in the River Plate. On 15 November the expedition left Montevideo, calling first at Puerto Deseado, where Malaspina rated his chronometers. He then made for Port Egmont, in West Falkland, in order to rate his chronometers again, to water ship and survey this spacious harbour.</p><p><strong>The Falkland Islands</strong></p><p>On 17 December Malaspina sighted the Jason Islands and at once began to carry out various hydrographic tasks, comparing his findings with those obtained by Captain John McBRIDE in 1766, whose track in the  <em>Jason </em>was depicted on 'A Chart of Hawkins's Maidenland' in the published account of Cook's first voyage, which was held on board the  <em>Descubierta </em>. Passing well to the south of Sedge Island to avoid a dangerous rock shown on McBride's chart, Malaspina anchored in Port Egmont on 18 December opposite the site of the first British settlement on Saunders Island. A <em>sumaca </em>(a small sailing coaster) named the  <em>San Juan Bautista, </em>which had arrived a few days previously from the Spanish settlement in Puerto de la Soledad, in today's Berkeley Sound, was already at anchor in the harbour.</p><p>An officer was sent ashore to ascertain the whereabouts of the watering place, finding near a ruined jetty a stream with crystal clear water. Nearby Wild Celery ( <em>Apium australe </em>) and European Scurvy Grass ( <em>Cochlearia officinalis </em>) were growing abundantly, which were collected and taken on board the corvettes as both were excellent antiscorbutics. A portable observatory was set up near the jetty where two officers were left to take the necessary observations to rate the chronometers and obtain the geographical position of the observatory. Meanwhile a chain of survey marks, whose positions were fixed by triangulation, was established around the harbour, which was then surveyed.</p><p>Two days after their arrival, Malaspina allowed the greater part of both ships' companies to land for recreation. Some of the seamen, however, set fire to a pile of peat and soon the whole of the nearby hillside was alight. Although firefighters were landed, they were unable to bring the fire under control, causing damage to the local ecology, while the smoke also affected the astronomical observations and survey operations.</p><p>During the visit the expedition's botanist, Luis Neé, collected a substantial number of plants, some of which were drawn on the spot by the artist José Guio. These included six new species of plants, including the beautiful Native Pansy or Yellow Violet ( <em>Viola maculata </em>), Scurvy Grass or Vinaigrette ( <em>Oxalis enneaphylla </em>) and Arrow-leaved Marigold ( <em>Caltha sagittata </em> details of all six plants were published shortly after the expedition's return to Spain by Antonio José de Cavanilles, Director of the Spanish Royal Botanic Gardens.</p><p><strong>The Americas and the Pacific</strong></p><p>On leaving Port Egmont on Christmas Eve, Malaspina worked his way up the west coast of South America, calling at Puerto San Carlos, in the island of Chiloe, Talcahuano and the Juan Fernandez Islands, before reaching Valparaiso on 17 March 1790. Malaspina next called at Coquimbo to rate his chronometers, before visiting the isolated island of San Felix to fix its position, eventually reaching Callao on 21 May, where he remained for four months, enabling him to visit the archives in Lima and the naturalists to explore the hinterland. Malaspina next visited Guayaquil, spending most of October there, before making for Panama, which he reached on 16 November. Malaspina next called at Realejo, in present day Nicaragua, from where it took him two months to reach Acapulco, due to adverse currents and unseasonable weather.</p><p>From Acapulco Malaspina made an overland visit to Mexico City to call on Viceroy Conde de Revillagigedo, staying there for several days to arrange for various members of the expedition to travel throughout Mexico to obtain information on the natural resources of the region. While in Acapulco Malaspina received fresh instructions from Madrid to search for a strait, opening into the Pacific in 60°N, supposedly discovered in 1588 by Lorenzo Ferrer Maldonado. In addition he was to call at Nootka Sound, on the NW coast of Vancouver Island, to investigate the controversy that had arisen there over conflicting Spanish and British territorial claims. On 21 April 1791 two experienced officers joined the expedition from Spain, bringing with them a special pendulum to carry out observations to determine the force of gravity. By timing the oscillations of the pendulum a value for the force of gravity could be calculated. If sufficient observations could be obtained at various latitudes both north and south of the equator the shape of the earth could then be calculated. The first of such observations was made at Acapulco and thereafter at every subsequent place visited by the expedition.</p><p>On 1 May Malaspina set off from Acapulco to explore the NW coast of North America, anchoring on 27 June in Yakutat Bay on the south coast of Alaska, where he hoped to find the entrance to Maldonado's supposed strait, since the bay was situated in roughly 60°N. Finding the head of the bay blocked by ice, Malaspina continued his exploration to the west, but on reaching the entrance to Prince William Sound, he was by now convinced that there was not even a sizeable river along the coast he had examined and that Maldonado's strait did not exist. He therefore altered course to the south for Nootka Sound. Malaspina entered Nootka Sound on 13 August, anchoring off the Spanish establishment in Friendly Cove. The fifteen days Malaspina spent at Nootka was a period of great activity The observatory was landed for astronomical and pendulum observations, native customs were observed, botanical collections made and the surrounding inland waters surveyed. Continuing to the south Malaspina called first at Monterey and then at the naval establishment at San Blas, to obtain supplies and rate his chronometers, before continuing to Acapulco, which he reached on 19 October.</p><p>After a stay of two months, Malaspina set off across the Pacific on 20 December. After calling at Guam and various islands in the central Philippines, Malaspina finally anchored off Manila on 26 March 1792. Except for a break of ten days while he was examining the west coast of Luzon, Malaspina remained at anchor off Manila for over eight months During this time Bustamante was sent to the Portuguese settlement at Macau, while the scientists made expeditions in Luzon. On completion of his work in the Philippines, Malaspina made for the SW tip of New Zealand's South Island in order to take observations for gravity at Dusky Sound, which had been visited by Cook in 1773. Gale force winds, however, forced him to abandon this idea and so he made for the British convict settlement in Port Jackson, on the east coast of New South Wales, where he was warmly welcomed and where the observations were made instead. Malaspina remained in Port Jackson for almost a month, before setting off across the Pacific once more. Malaspina spent ten days in May 1793 in the Vava'u Group at the northern end of the Tongan archipelago, which had not been visited by Cook, before continuing across the Pacific. On 23 July the two corvettes were once again at anchor off Callao, where they remained for almost three months. November was spent in Talcahuano where the two corvettes separated, Malaspina heading once again for Port Egmont to carry out further gravity experiments, while Bustamante made for Puerto de la Soledad in Berkeley Sound, to report on the Spanish settlement there.</p><p><strong>Port Egmont</strong></p><p>On entering Port Egmont on 2 January 1794, Malaspina sighted two brigs at anchor, which displayed the American flag in response to that of Spain. Later that afternoon the two American captains came on board the  <em>Descubierta </em>and told Malaspina they were from New York and were visiting the Falklands to obtain oil and seal skins. They also told him that there were many other American vessels at anchor in various harbours in the vicinity, whose sailors were dispersed to the adjacent islands, keeping in touch with their parent vessels by launch, bringing to one vessel as many as 20,000 seal skins and a large number of barrels of oil, before continuing to China and the NW Coast of America. These disclosures made Malaspina realise the extent of the loss of revenue which he felt should accrue to the Spanish crown. Since his knowledge of the current state of Europe was very confused and out of date he decided not to take any hasty steps for the time being. Communication between the two parties was, however, not very frequent as Malaspina had anchored two miles from the American brigs.</p><p>To achieve the best possible accuracy in the pendulum experiments Malaspina set up his observatory on the edge of the harbour some 400 yards from the previous site, where it was less exposed to the prevailing westerly winds. The foundations for the astronomical quadrant, which was set up in one tent, and for the pendulum, which was set up in an adjacent tent, were constructed of stones firmly stamped into the ground. Two chronometers were placed in the same tent as the pendulum, well above the ground to protect them from rising damp and frost. Although the weather interfered with the observations to some extent, in the end they were concluded satisfactorily. The site of the observatory was less satisfactory for rating the chronometers, the observations being frequently interrupted by hailstorms and SW winds.</p><p>On arrival Malaspina was very concerned with the health of his crew, many of whom were extremely debilitated, which he hoped could be alleviated by recreation and relaxation on shore. He therefore erected an awning close to the landing place, where the crew could eat and shelter. Once again wild celery was collected to combat scurvy, while fishing parties were successful in catching a large quantity of a species of \"cod\", (probably the Falklands mullet) which proved to be excellent eating. As a result the health of the crew gradually improved.</p><p>On 9 January a small American schooner entered Port Egmont, seeking supplies for her parent ship, which had been anchored off Westpoint Island for fourteen months in a disabled condition. Malaspina supplied the schooner with all the naval stores and ship's biscuits that her parent ship required. Although Malaspina did not name this ship in his journal it was the 80 ton brig  <em>Mercury </em>of Providence, Rhode Island, Captain William Barnet, which had lost a rudder off Cape Horn, forcing her to make for the Falklands in distress. After sailing from the Falklands, Barnet called at Port Jackson, bringing with him welcome news to many of Malaspina's friends there that he had encountered the  <em>Descubierta </em>in Port Egmont. He also informed them, that when he offered to pay for the ship's biscuits in any manner that the Spanish might require, Malaspina refused payment, saying that he was pleased to assist a vessel, whether English or American, which spoke the language of those gentlemen from whom he and his officers had received such attention and hospitality when in Port Jackson.</p><p>Meanwhile, the launches of the American vessels were being sent away almost every day to search the nearby islands for seals. Realising that further delay would merely increase the slaughter of the seals, Malaspina came to the conclusion that he was empowered to act against the Americans, although he saw the need to do so with tact. He therefore summoned on board the captains of the two brigs and Captain White, who was in command of the small schooner, to show them papers, which he considered gave the Spaniards title to the islands. He then gave the Americans orders to leave the islands as soon as possible, although he realised that they could easily transfer their activities to a nearby harbour with impunity, particularly as he was due to sail himself in no more than twelve days time. The captains asked for a delay until their boats returned, to which Malaspina readily agreed. Some trading then took place, but Captain White, having no negotiable money or useful items to exchange, agreed instead to take his schooner on a seven-day excursion, with one of Malaspina's junior officers, Piloto Juan de Inciarte, to examine various harbours as far as Cape Percival and to look for a much easier entrance and exit for vessels proceeding from Port Egmont to Peru and the Pacific.</p><p>Malaspina gives very little detail in his journal of what Inciarte achieved, beyond saying he was well entertained by Barnet off Westpoint Island. During his enforced stay Barnet had raised some excellent vegetables, some of which Inciarte brought back with him together with some pigs and rabbits from an adjacent island. One of Malaspina's manuscript charts, however, shows what is probably Inciarte's track, first approaching the southern end of Carcass Island and then passing through Woolly Gut, separating Westpoint Island from the mainland of West Falkland. He next visited one of the anchorages on the east side of New Island and the excellent anchorage under Beacon Point at the northern end of Weddell Island, before finally returning to Port Egmont through Woolly Gut. On his return Inciarte was accompanied by a launch crewed by six English sailors, who had been left in the Falklands, with ample provisions, seven months earlier by an English ship to hunt for seals. Having apparently felt they had been deserted, they had eventually handed over their skins to an American sealer sailing for China for selling there. Three of them asked for and were granted a place on board the  <em>Descubierta </em>.</p><p>Having completed all his tasks and with the health of his crew much improved, Malaspina prepared to get under way, but first he collected some wild celery and some birds, presumably Upland Geese. However, a succession of gales prevented him sailing until the morning of 20 January. By midday he was clear of the harbour entrance and, after passing between Wreck Reef and Port Egmont Cays he set a course for Santa Elena on the coast of Patagonia in order to survey this anchorage and to carry out further gravity observations, finally anchoring off Montevideo on 14 February 1794, where he was joined by Bustamante two days later. Bustamante, having completed his examination of the Spanish settlement in Puerto de la Soledad, had attempted to locate the Aurora Islands, supposedly sighted to the east of the Falkland Islands by a Spanish vessel of that name in 1762.</p><p><strong>Back to Spain</strong></p><p>Because of the outbreak of war with France, Malaspina was forced to remain in the River Plate for four months before he could join a convoy of merchantmen back to Spain. In consequence it was not until 21 September 1794 that the expedition finally arrived back in Cadiz after an absence of five years and almost two months. The return of the expedition to Spain was greeted with great enthusiasm and work was begun at once to publish the results. On 24 March 1795 Malaspina was promoted to  <em>brigadier de la real armada </em>, but on 24 November of the same year, having fallen foul of Manuel Godoy, the first minister, he was arrested and imprisoned in Castillo de San Antón in the harbour of La Corunna where he remained until 15 March 1807, when he was released on agreeing never to set foot in Spain again. He died on 9 April 1810 in northern Italy in the little town of Pontremoli, not far from his birthplace.</p><p>With the suppression of the projected publication of Malaspina's voyage, the considerable achievements of his expedition were largely forgotten for almost a hundred years, until an edited version of his journal was published in Madrid in 1885. Enthusiasm for Malaspina's voyage has now been rekindled in Spain, culminating in the publication of the most authentic version of Malaspina's journal in Madrid in 1990, with eight further volumes covering various aspects of the voyage. A fully annotated translation of Malaspina's journal has now been published by the Hakluyt Society, making his voyage available to a wider audience.</p>",

        "body": "<p>campaigner, was born in Stanley on 28 February 1930, daughter of Axel Pettersson, son of a shipwrecked Swedish seaman and Beatrice Petterson, née Reive. A bright pupil in the Falklands, she won a scholarship to the British School in Montevideo. As a child she rode long distances cross-country on horseback. Her love of horses never left her and she later owned a racehorse. She began work in the Government Secretariat and served on the newly-formed Civil Servants' Association. As a pillar of social and sporting life, she ran the Girls Life Brigade as its Captain, and, with her husband, the Scottish and country dancing club. She was a badminton player, champion rifle shot and bridge player. She turned down an invitation from Governor Parker to be the first woman member of ExCo.</p><p>Her family owned the Stanley Arms pub and later the Rose Hotel in Stanley, which Velma Malcolm ran for many years. Her parents looked after several wounded from HMS <em>Exeter </em>after the 1939 Battle of the River Plate. They were among many people to whom she and her family gave hospitality, including British servicemen and members of the British Antarctic Survey. Many became her life-long friends.</p><p>In 1956, she married George Malcolm, a farm worker who came from Scotland. Their daughter, Ailsa (b1958), and her husband, Tony Heathman, gave crucial help to the 1982 Task Force from their farm Estancia. George Malcolm died in 1996.</p><p>From the early 1970s, Velma Malcolm was the driving force behind the Falkland Islands Emergency Committee (later the Falkland Islands Association) as secretary of the Local (Stanley) Committee. She was also a vice-president of the Association and an indefatigable fund-raiser. She ceaselessly monitored and energetically countered Foreign Office attempts to accommodate Argentina's sovereignty claim, in liaison with Hunter <a href=\"/biographies/christie_eric\">CHRISTIE</a> and the Association's other leaders in London. With a prodigious memory and meticulous records, she forcefully unleashed her arguments upon a succession of chastened Foreign Office ministers who dared suggest any surrender of sovereignty. She was a prime target for Argentine harassment during the 1982 invasion, one of a number of Islanders rounded up at gunpoint and placed under house arrest. Knowing Spanish, she heard one Argentine say: 'I'd like to shoot them all'. She and her husband were confined in crowded conditions in Fox Bay for more than 50 days.</p><p>She dictated a fascinating account of her life in a privately printed book entitled <em>As Ignorant as Sheep  </em>which was how she felt the Foreign Office and the outside world viewed the Islanders. Her life proved otherwise, as a shrewd Falklands patriot and courageous fighter for self-determination. Her tough, uncompromising antipathy to Argentina masked a generous-hearted woman with a gift for friendship. Her integrity won her much respect. She was awarded the British Empire Medal (BEM) for services to the community in 1978.</p><p>She died on 2 August 2004, in hospital in Santiago, Chile, after an operation. In his eulogy at her funeral Councillor Michael Summers said of her:</p><blockquote><blockquote>Velma Malcolm was a big lady. Not only was she a physically imposing person, but politically, socially and in sporting life, she was one of the most active people of her generation, and a strong leader of the community.</blockquote></blockquote>",

        "body": " <p>British and Breton evangelist, was born in Wales at a time when the Celtic inhabitants of Britain had taken refuge there under pressure from Anglo-Saxon invaders. Many of these Britons then fled to Brittany in western France and Malo was one of them. He was known as the apostle of the Bretons and relics of his life were gathered at a small peninsula on the north coast of Brittany near a Gallo-Roman city named Alet, which was also the seat of a bishopric. In 1145 the bishop's see was moved about a mile further north to the new city of St Malo de l'Ile (St Malo of the Island).</p><p>During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries the port of St Malo became a centre of maritime trade and exploration. Jacques Cartier, born in the town, sailed from there between 1534 and 1542 on his voyages of exploration in Canada and sailors from St Malo established themselves in the Newfoundland cod fishery, catching the fish and delivering them to the Spanish and Italian ports in the Mediterranean. During the seventeenth century the people of St Malo developed their maritime trade and in 1664 they associated themselves with the (French) East India Company founded by Colbert.</p><p>The peak of St Malo's importance came at the end of the seventeenth century and the start of the eighteenth thanks to the trade with Peru via Cape Horn. Armed frigates carried cargos for sale in Peru in exchange for silver - a trade which was forbidden by the government in Madrid, but to which the colonial authorities turned a blind eye. On his return from the first voyage to the South Seas, the Malouin sea captain, Jacques Gouin de <a href=\"/biographies/beauchesne_jacques\">BEAUCHESNE</a> discovered the island which bears his name south of the Falklands group on 19 January 1701. On 14 October 1705, a squadron commanded by another Malouin, Julien Eon de Carman, discovered other islands (including Sea Lion Island) south of East Falkland (which he did not discern). These he called the Danycan Islands, after the Malouin ship-builder and merchant Noël Danycan de l'Epine who had sponsored this and many other expeditions.</p><p>In 1712 an alliance between France and Spain reasserted the ban on trade with Spanish America and a French decree of January 1712 forbade it. In 1716 the French crown sent a squadron to enforce the ban and in 1717 six French trading vessels were captured. St Malo's brief heyday of South Seas trade came to an end. But the town's name became attached to the Islands, thanks to a map produced by another French explorer, Amédée-François <a href=\"/biographies/frezier_amedee\">FRÉZIER</a>, who had visited and surveyed them in 1712-13. Frézier's map of 1716 described the Islands as the Isles Nouvelles, and in the map's title this was expanded to (in translation):'New Islands discovered by the vessels from St Malo since 1700 of which the western part is still unknown'.</p><p>The royal geographer, Guillaume Delisle, shortened this in his maps of 1722 and 1724, to Isles Malouines and the name stuck. It was adopted by the Spaniards as Islas Maluinas and early in the nineteenth century the name became Malvinas. In the late eighteenth century the name was anglicised by the whalers as The Maloons - the Grand Maloon was West Falkland and Spanish Maloon, the East Falkland.</p>",

The family lived in Killiney, a village (then) outside Dublin and he was educated at Castle Park in Ireland and then at Shrewsbury School followed by Magdalene College, Cambridge. After graduating, he joined the Ceylon Civil Service and spent almost his entire working life in Ceylon {Sri Lanka}. Shortly after arriving in Ceylon, he was taken under the wing of a tea planter and his wife, James and Nancy Epps, and it was their daughter Pam whom he eventually married in September 1948. The fact that he was awarded the OBE in the 1949 New Year's Honours was unrelated! They had their first daughter, Susan, in 1950, followed by Dorothy in 1953.</p><p>After Ceylon's independence in 1948, Manders was invited to stay on and assist in the changeover. He stayed until 1959, the last British colonial servant on the island. In 1959 the family returned to Milford on Sea in Hampshire where his parents had settled after Irish independence. The idea was that, now he was formally retired, he would teach at a local prep school so he duly undertook a teacher's training course. Before he had time to take up the position offered however, he was invited to come out of retirement to become colonial secretary to the Falkland Islands, somewhere certainly his wife and children had never heard of.</p><p>So in 1960 the family set off across the world once again. Manders thoroughly enjoyed his time in Stanley under Governor <a href=\"/biographies/arrowsmith_sir\">ARROWSMITH</a>. The couple loved walking, fishing, riding and bird watching so it was a perfect place for them and they spent many happy days visiting the Camp (mainly on horseback), walking in the area around Stanley and on overnight excursions to Kidney Island and Eliza Cove. They also took a trip on the <em>Darwin </em>to South Georgia, again an experience they both adored.</p><p>They were very happy in the Falkland Islands and, had it not been for the fact that Susan had been sent to boarding school in England in 1962, would definitely have stayed on for an extra two years as requested. However, because communications were so limited and journeys so long, they decided to return in 1963.</p><p>They had made many good friends though and they kept in touch both through them and through the <em>Falkland Islands Review </em>, later the <em>Penguin News </em>. Visitors from Stanley and the camp often stayed in Milford on Sea and both Manders were actively involved in the 'Keep the Falkland Islands British' campaign which preceded the Argentine invasion. David Manders died in January 1985, and his wife in February 2002.</p>",

Educated at Winchester College and Christ Church Oxford, he served in the Royal Navy from 1942-6. He entered the Nigerian administration in 1948, and was seconded to South Georgia from the Government of Northern Nigeria for what was known as the International Geophysical Year, 1956-59, because the government of Argentina was unstable and it was expected that they might provoke some disruption. He and his family arrived in King Edward Point in March 1957 coming via the SS <em>Fitzroy </em>and HMS <em>Protector </em>.</p><p>These were years of an unprecedented research in and around the Antarctic. Sir Vivian <a href=\"/biographies/fuchs_sir\">FUCHS</a> crossed over the continent. Whaling was in full swing from three shore stations on South Georgia. Salvesens had two pelagic* expeditions which began and ended each season in Leith Harbour. All the Salvesen catchers were dry-docked and repaired annually there and the catchers of Grytviken and Husvik were serviced there in the winter or occasionally sent off for repair elsewhere. The 24 hour reporting by the meteorological staff was held in high regard. There were never fewer than 700 people on the Island at that time and many more during the season. This started with sealing in September, the Island being divided into three sections, one of which was rested from sealing each year. In this way the seal population of the Island was kept steady.</p><p>Matthew took the opportunity of going right round the Island twice, visiting every bay and, landing on Annenkov Island which few other than sealers had visited. At that time fur seals were to be found only on Bird Island. A man claiming to be an Argentine customs officer appeared in 1958 and again in 1959 arriving on a Compañia Argentina de Pesca transport ship from Buenos Aires. He rather naively said he had come to assume duty ashore in South Georgia. However he was required to remain on board ship while he was there, except once when he was escorted ashore by the policeman/handyman in uniform to the dentist's surgery at Grytviken for treatment and back on board again. The colonial secretary in Stanley was informed in the non-secure government telegraph code - enough to establish and make plain the position without fuss. Both the captain and the chief officer of the Pesca transport ship were seconded Argentine naval officers. They were cheerful company and the captain at least enjoyed the British connection in clubs in Buenos Aires.</p><p>In 1959 Matthew made two recommendations to the governor, Sir Edwin <a href=\"/biographies/arrowsmith_sir\">ARROWSMITH</a>, to the under-secretary of state for the colonies, Sir John Macpherson, to the governor of Northern Nigeria, Sir Bryan Sharwood Smith, and to (now Sir) Peter Smithers, who was MP for Winchester and parliamentary secretary to the minister of state for the Colonies, each of whom he knew and had spoken to personally. His recommendations were that:</p><blockquote><blockquote>1. There should be a new substantial building to house the government staff at King Edward Point.</blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>2. There should be a hydrographic survey made of the rock-strewn South West side of South Georgia of which there was still little known except what was held in the heads of Pesca's sealing Captains.</blockquote></blockquote><p>Both recommendations were accepted and extensive hydrographic survey work was achieved during the next three years particularly by HMS <em>Owen </em>. The new building was called Shackleton House and stood till it was demolished in 2001. The published Admiralty chart work is there for all to see.</p><p>Matthew arrived back in Nigeria on 7 December 1959, the day that the last genuine and properly supervised Nigerian government election ever took place - so far. He retired from Nigeria in 1963 and served as assistant bursar at Winchester College from 1965-85. He was a City and (Hampshire) county councillor and stood for Parliament and the European Parliament as a Liberal candidate. He was awarded the OBE in 1981.</p><p>He married Jeanie Hay Kay in 1952. They had four children: Francis (b1956), David (b1958) Jeanie (b1960) and Lillias (b1965). He died in a car accident on 5 July 2003.</p>",

They had two children, Jean and John .</p><p>In 1924 Matthews joined the Discovery Expedition and helped to create the shore station at Grytviken, South Georgia; this was set up to conduct scientific research on the Antarctic and to provide data for the management of the whaling industry. To do this Matthews spent time collecting statistics on the whales brought into the flensing station and going with the whalers in search of whales and seals which were hunted for their blubber. He had a good rapport with the men themselves and shared their harsh and uncomfortable living and working conditions. He made many observations in the field on the behaviour of sea lions, seals, albatross and penguins and describes going among their colonies. Matthews collected scientific data on their behaviour, anatomy and physiology. He also collected tales from the whalers themselves and had many yarns to tell. This enabled him to write his later popular books, <em>Wandering Albatross </em>and <em>Sea Elephant </em>.</p><p>On his return to Bristol he spent a number of years writing up and publishing papers for the Discovery Reports including three major monographs on the Humpback, Sei and Sperm whales. He also wrote <em>South Georgia, the British Empire's Sub-Antarctic Outpost, </em>a history of the Island and its ecology.</p><p>During World War II he worked on radar for the Telecommunications Research Establishment and then with the RAF at Stradishall in Suffolk. He returned to Bristol in 1945 as Research Fellow at the University.

During his years in London he served on the council of the Ray Society, was president, section D of the British Association for the Advancement of Science (1959), the Association of British Zoologists (1960) the British Academy of Forensic Science and the Ray Society (1965). He was chairman, World List of Scientific Periodicals (1959-66) and of the Seals sub-committee of the Natural Environment Research Council (1967-71).

Matthews was awarded the Zoological Society of London's Silver Medal in 1985.</p><p>Matthews was profoundly influenced by his time spent in the Antarctic. He had many tales to tell and was able to entertain his friends, and of course, his family over the dinner table after long-lasting meals. In retirement he renovated the Old Rectory making it his family home and spent many happy hours growing fruit and vegetables and developing his three and a half acres.

He was promoted lieutenant in 1856 and two years later joined the <em>Plumper,  </em>Captain GH Richards, employed on the survey of Vancouver Island and British Columbia. During the survey he was sent up the Fraser River to assist Colonel Richard <a href=\"/biographies/moody_richard\">MOODY</a>, former governor of the Falklands, in a confrontation with Edward (Ned) McGowan. Mayne also carried out a survey of the area occupied by miners and made a general report on the area. He was promoted commander in 1861 and afterwards commanded the <em>Eclipse </em>in New Zealand during the war of 1861-2, when he was badly wounded. For his services there he was mentioned in despatches and promoted to captain. In 1866 he was appointed in command of the surveying vessel <em>Nassau </em>, in which he was employed for three years carrying out surveys in Magellan Strait. During the course of this survey Mayne made two visits to the Falklands. The first visit, between 18 February and 3 March 1867, was spent in Port Stanley provisioning and coaling ship.</p><p>His second visit, between 14 January and 1 February 1868, was again to provision and coal ship. However, much of Mayne's second visit was taken up enquiring into the sale of the 484 ton British barque <em>Coquimbana </em>, wrecked on Tysssen Patch in Falkland Sound on 31 May 1867, when bound from Valparaiso to Bristol with a cargo of copper and barley. Captain Thomas Boden, the barque's captain, sold the wreck by auction in Stanley to Don Luis Piedra <a href=\"/biographies/buena\">BUENA</a>, a well-known sea captain and adventurer. As a result Captain David Miller, RN, was sent to Stanley as a special agent for Lloyds to sue Piedra Buena in the Magistrate's Court for the return of the ship and cargo on the grounds that the sale was not of necessity and therefore illegal. The court, however, found in favour of the defendant. Miller then lodged an appeal to Governor William <a href=\"/biographies/robinson_sir\">ROBINSON</a>. As a result the governor asked Rear-Admiral George Ramsay, commander-in-chief SE coast of America, who was in Stanley at the time in his flagship HMS <em>Narcissus, </em>for assistance. Ramsay sent Mayne and the commanding officer of the <em>Narcissus, </em>Captain John C Wilson, to examine the wreck. They left Stanley by boat on 16 January, returning on 20 January. At the subsequent appeal to the Council, chaired by the governor, Mayne and Wilson's report to Admiral Ramsay was read, in which Mayne stated that the wreck was in no danger of breaking up. In cross-examination Mayne stated he did not wish to alter one word of the report. In consequence the Council upheld the appeal and ordered that the appellant should take possession of the wreck on payment to Piedra Buena of £250, the original purchase price of the wreck. As an addendum to their decision the Council stated that it was their opinion that Piedra Buena acted in good faith and that as he had been to considerable trouble and expense in clearing away the barley preparatory to getting at the copper he was entitled to some consideration at the hands of the appellant. In writing to the Hydrographer of the Navy, Mayne referred to the sale to Piedra Buena as a swindle as the cargo of copper worth £9,000 had been sold for £250. On his way back to his survey area Mayne landed a party of ten seamen and marines from the <em>Narcissus </em>, under the command of Lieutenant Henry J Carr, with a pinnace, on Tyssen Islands to recover the copper from the wreck, which was expected to take a month to six weeks. Piedra Buena was also present in a small sealing schooner. Afterwards Mayne took shelter in Fox Bay, departing from there on 1 February for Magellan Strait.</p><p>Mayne commanded the <em>Invincible </em>on the Mediterranean station (1875-6). He was placed on the retired list in 1879 with the rank of rear-admiral. He died in 1892. He was created CB in 1867.</p>",

Her parents came to the Falklands from Brora on the northeast coast of Scotland, having eloped together because Barbara's parents disapproved of George. The first of their children was born in 1883 and the last in 1901; all survived.</p><p>Lottie's father was an 'outside shepherd', living and working at a distance from the main settlement, Fox Bay West. Lottie grew up as a Camp child in great freedom, learning to live a very self-sufficient life, which included milking cows for the family. Undoubtedly she would also have helped with her younger brothers and sisters as they came along. When she was old enough she went to work at Roy Cove for WW <a href=\"/biographies/bertrand_william\">BERTRANDS'</a> family (and for the Clements). Coincidentally she and her future husband Jack (from the Isle of Skye) started work on the same day, she as a maid and he as a shepherd. Her parents emigrated to Australia in the early 1900s, taking the four youngest children with them and she did not see any of them again.</p><p>Jack McAskill and Lottie McKay were married at Mount Sulivan House, an outside shepherd's house north of Fox Bay West on 10 May, 1911. The assistant cathedral chaplain, J Meredith Bate officiated at the wedding, and the witnesses were three of Lottie's brothers, Richard, Donald and Gideon McKay. Sulivan House was within easy riding distance of Goring House, Chartres, where Jack and Lottie made their home. She was a marvellous housekeeper, the house always smelling of freshly scrubbed benches and polish which she used to make herself. She milked her cows every day, setting the milk in big white basins, and skimming the cream to make butter. A small, energetic and outspoken woman, she was endlessly hospitable. She was an excellent horsewoman who always rode side-saddle, and took part in the horse races that were part of the annual West Falkland Sports week. She had no children of her own, but the family of her brother Dave living not far away at Teal River were much loved.</p><p>In 1918 a radio station came to Fox Bay, bringing an enormous benefit by linking West to East Falkland. At Fox Bay was the government establishment: the stipendiary magistrate who was also postmaster and collector of customs lived here; so did the doctor. Chartres was the first station to put a telephone line through to Fox Bay, and very soon others followed suit. This revolutionised communications, and also meant one could phone the doctor, instead of riding for many hours to call him, often only to find that he had been called away elsewhere.</p><p>This was where Lottie, or Mrs Mac as she was increasingly known, came in. The single wire party lines stretched for many miles and no less than four lines met at Goring House. On each of the lines there were a number of telephones and each phone reduced the strength of the current, so a small switchboard was installed. Mrs Mac became unofficial telephone operator, assisting people at all hours of the day, and of the night if a medical emergency arose. It must have been such a burden at times, and yet she was never heard to complain and her service to the West Falkland community was recognised in 1961 with the award of the British Empire Medal. Governor <a href=\"/biographies/arrowsmith_sir\">ARROWSMITH</a> travelled to Chartres and thence to Goring House to present her with the medal; she not considering it necessary to travel to Stanley! Indeed she seems only to have visited Stanley twice in her sixty years at Chartres, both for reasons of illness.</p><p>Goring House was on the main north/south track of West Falkland, and everyone who passed called in for 'smoko'. Innumerable cups of tea and homemade cakes were consumed under the McAskills' roof in all those years. In the old days it was a welcome break for horses and riders, and later with the advent of motor bikes and Landrovers the custom continued. Indeed if one passed without calling in, there would be a question as to why next time one phoned through.</p><p>She and Jack celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary in 1961, but Jack McAskill died in 1968. Mrs Mac continued to live at Goring House, looking after the young single shepherds who were now responsible for the flocks which Jack had looked after for so many years. In 1973 she moved to Stanley, taking with her her two favourite cows and her old dog. She and her sister-in-law Rosie, widow of her brother Dave, lived together in a bungalow on Davis Street, and she could be seen regularly setting off to milk her cows or taking them to new grass. Mrs Mac died in 1979, and with her passed a legend of hospitality and service to the community.</p>",

        "body": " <p>naval officer, was the son of Robert McBride, a Presbyterian minister, and raised in Ballymoney, Co Antrim. He may have been born in Scotland prior to his father's settlement in Ireland, but Ballymoney is the more probable birthplace.</p><p>John McBride entered the navy as able seaman in 1754 and was promoted to the rank of lieutenant in 1758 after serving four years in the West Indies. In 1761 he was commended for action against the French at Dunkirk whilst commanding the armed cutter <em>Grace </em>, where he is reported to have shown both 'bravery and humanity'. Between 1762 and 1765 he was commander successively of the fire-ship <em>Grampus </em>, the <em>Vulture </em>, the <em>Cruiser </em>and the frigate <em>Renown </em>. In 1765 he was appointed to the frigate <em>Jason </em>and received his orders to command an expeditionary force to the Falkland Islands.</p><p>Alongside the <em>Jason </em>, the sloop <em>Carcass </em>and the store-ship <em>Experiment </em>were included in McBride's expedition. The fleet landed at Port Egmont on 8 January 1766. The first few weeks were spent setting up a shore establishment and it was not until 25 January that McBride left to carry out the first ever survey of the western side of the Islands. McBride, however, did not share <a href=\"/biographies/byron_john\">BYRON</a>'s reported enthusiasm for the Falklands, claiming instead that his work there was 'a difficult and disagreeable service in the climate'. He also complained about the rocky terrain and the 'incredible' numbers of 'vermin' on the Islands, by which he meant sea-lions and penguins. Writing back to the First Lord of the Admiralty, he moaned: 'Your lordship will easily conceive what a dreary prospect a range of craggy barren mountains must afford, heightened by almost constant gales of wind'.</p><p>Despite difficulties surveying the area, McBride successfully completed a map of the Islands, which was one of the first satisfactory representations of the Falklands. He also completed the first weather records of the Islands, recorded in his <em>Journal of the Wind and Weather...of the Falkland Islands </em>. McBride was impressed by the port possibilities at Port Egmont, and planted gardens on Saunders Island. However, he wrote back to the Earl of Egmont: 'We are endeavouring to make gardens...[but] my expectations of them are not sanguine. This country, I believe, must have abler Farmers than sailors to make anything of it.'</p><p>Goats, sheep and pigs which had been brought out thrived at the new settlement.</p><p>Between April and September 1766 a blockhouse was completed, six more gardens planted and two houses built at Port Egmont. A wharf was also constructed and guns erected. Although a modest settlement, it was the British Empire's most southerly possession. In the summer months boats were sent out to conduct a further survey, during which they found a bottle containing the names of <a href=\"/biographies/bougainville_louis\">BOUGAINVILLE</a>'s first (French) expedition.</p><p>McBride's instructions had been to request any foreign 'squatters' to leave, but at all costs to avoid hostilities. With the discovery of the French at Berkeley Sound in East Falkland, McBride and several of his party visited their settlement. Although the French commandant M de <a href=\"/biographies/nerville_michel\">NERVILLE</a> refused to comply with McBride's plea to vacate the Islands, on the personal level, the British visit was a success, with the two parties proving amicable towards each other. McBride was under instructions not to pursue the matter with any hostility and in 1767 was recalled to the United Kingdom, to report on his voyage.</p><p>Before he left the Falklands, McBride renamed the Islands where he and his party had been, in his words, 'the undisputed lords of tempest-beaten barrenness'. Captain <a href=\"?q=node/398\">RODGERS</a> had named the Islands 'Falkland's Land' in 1708: this McBride changed to 'The Falkland Islands' before his departure.</p><p>In 1768 he captained the <em>Seaford </em>at home and for the next seventeen years saw much distinguished service against the French. In 1778 he fought with Admiral Keppel in an inconclusive battle against the French at Ushant. He is also known to have brought to England Princess Charlotte of Meckenburg-Schwerin to marry George III. In 1784 McBride was stationed in the Irish Sea, probably due to his Irish background, where he was described in the <em>Biographia Navalis </em>as having 'considerably advanced the service, as well by the great esteem in which he was held...' Between 1785 and 1790 he became the MP for Plymouth and in 1794 was promoted to rear-admiral of the Blue Squadron. Further action against the French was followed by a final promotion in February 1799 to the rank of admiral of the Blue Squadron. McBride died in 1800, reportedly of a 'seizure'. He was twice married with several children. He is commemorated by McBride Head, on the north east coast of East Falkland and in the 1987 'Early Charting' stamp issue. His ship gave her name to the Jason Islands, north west of West Falkland.</p>",

        "body": "<p>naval surgeon, was born in Runham, near Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, the son of Surgeon Robert McCormick, RN, from Co Tyrone. It was during his boyhood wanderings that he became interested in natural history. In 1823 he was appointed assistant surgeon in HMS  <em>Queen Charlotte </em>after little over a year at the United Borough Hospitals of Guy's and St. Thomas's, London, where he obtained his MRCS diploma. He visited the West Indies for the first time in 1823-25, which gave him a dislike of small ships and the West Indies station. Two years later, in 1827, he took part, as assistant surgeon of HMS  <em>Hecla </em>, in Captain WE Parry's attempt to reach the North Pole.</p><p>In July 1831, he was appointed surgeon in HMS  <em>Beagle </em>, Captain Robert <a href=\"/biographies/fitzroy_robert\">FITZROY</a>, but returned to England the following year, being 'invalided', but possibly jealous of young Charles <a href=\"/biographies/darwin_charles\">DARWIN</a>. As surgeon, with responsibility for geology, in HMS  <em>Erebus </em>during the celebrated scientific Antarctic circumnavigation, under the command of Captain James Clark <a href=\"/biographies/ross_sir\">ROSS</a>, McCormick got on well with Joseph Dalton <a href=\"/biographies/hooker_sir\">HOOKER</a>, the assistant surgeon, nearly twenty years his junior, dividing the responsibility for natural history to McCormick's satisfaction. During the expedition, Ross named Cape McCormick on the coast of Victoria Land, Antarctica, after him. In Hobart, Tasmania, McCormick had met Sir John Franklin, the lieutenant-governor, and Lady Franklin. He was therefore particularly concerned at the disappearance of Franklin, commanding  <em>Erebus </em>and  <em>Terror </em>, during the last of the naval voyages in search of the North West Passage, 1845 - 48. In 1852, he was appointed surgeon in HMS  <em>North Star  </em>during the search for Franklin, from which ship, with Sir Edward Belcher's permission, he took the boat  <em>Forlorn Hope </em>with six men in August and September 1852 up Wellington Channel, but found no trace of the missing expedition. He returned to England in the  <em>Phoenix </em>and saw no more active service, being promoted deputy inspector for hospitals and fleets in 1859 and put on the retired list in 1865. His portrait by Stephen Pearce, 1853, was among those of the Arctic officers commissioned by John Barrow, now in the National Portrait Gallery. He had spent long periods on half pay during his naval career, some of his spare time being taken up in walking tours and attending lectures. The Antarctic Skua  <em>Catharacta skua maccormicki </em>was presumably named after him, as was the Tartary Oak  <em>Quercus mccormicki </em>, which illustrates the first page of his autobiography at the end of the second volume of his book (see below). He died at Wimbledon (where his house, 'Hecla Villa' still stands) on 28 October 1890.</p><p>McCormick twice visited the Falkland Islands, both times in HMS  <em>Erebus </em>. She anchored with the  <em>Terror </em>in Berkeley Sound on 6 April 1842. 'The land here', wrote McCormick in his book, 'has very much the aspect of the Shetlands or the Orkneys, in undulating slopes of brownish-green peat, and interspersed with tufts of tussock grass'. The small Government House, occupied by Lt <a href=\"/biographies/moody_richard\">MOODY</a> of the Royal Engineers, could be identified by its flagstaff. Troops of wild horses were observed while coming up the Sound. When a boat returned from the shore with a copy of the  <em>Navy List </em>, McCormick was disappointed to find that the senior medical officers alone had not been promoted, despite their extra duties in natural history.</p><p>He spent his time while in the Islands in shooting excursions mainly along the coast of Berkeley Sound, each day being described in his book and his bag listed. He sometimes left the ships in what he calls a sealskin punt, observing gauchos lassoing wild cattle with the  <em>bolas* </em>. At Urania Bay he shot three caracara hawks, which had been watching his proceedings 'at a respectful distance, with the intent of making my geese their prize'. The birds were shot for the collection. He had to cache the skin boat that day well above high water mark because of heavy squalls and snow, but on returning in a whale boat with two hands to take it back, found it had disappeared, together with his game.</p><p>On 31 May, he walked back from Johnson's Harbour, across a desolate landscape, which he described in these words:</p><blockquote><blockquote>The whole of the low grounds, with the ridge of hills bounding them to the north, presented the most dreary aspect, with the stillness and silence of death, there being nothing to relieve the eye from the white mantle of snow which enveloped the whole, and rendered travelling most laborious work, sinking at every step mid-leg deep in snow, amongst long grass, bushes, and other vegetation, passing on my way a small pond or two frozen over.</blockquote></blockquote><p>In early July, McCormick joined a ship's shooting party, which returned with twelve head of wild cattle. He gives quite a dramatic account of this.</p><p>The missionary Captain Allen <a href=\"/biographies/gardiner_allen\">GARDINER</a> had arrived early in the visit in a schooner. In August he asked McCormick to see his little daughter who was unwell. At the end of that month, McCormick reported that McMurdo, the first lieutenant of  <em>Terror </em>was being invalided home with an internal complaint. The  <em>Erebus </em>and  <em>Terror </em>sailed for Cape Horn on 8 September 1842 and returned to the Falklands on 13 November for a short stay. During this time, McCormick shot more bird specimens and collected eggs, also taking note of the vegetation and geology of the islands. The ships departed for their third and last southern voyage on 17 December 1842. On the decks were sheep, calves, wild pigs, turkeys, a goose and a wild colt, which was thoughtlessly shot by a party of midshipmen, much to McCormick's dismay at the killing of one of 'the beautiful wild creatures' he had so often encountered on his rambles.</p><p>One of the most uncommon books in polar literature is McCormick's two volume work written at the end of his career in the Navy and published in 1884. It has a very long title:</p><blockquote><blockquote> <em>Voyages of discovery in the Arctic and Antarctic seas, and round the World: being personal narratives of attempts to reach the North and South Poles: and of an open-boat expedition up Wellington Channel in search of Sir John Franklin and Her Majesty's Ships \"Erebus\" and \"Terror\" in Her Majesty's Boat \"Forlorn Hope\", under the command of the author to which are added an autobiography, appendix, portraits, maps and numerous illustrations. </em></blockquote></blockquote><p>This is packed with all the details of his life, even devoting pages to a tame duck which lived in his house. Numerous illustrations by the author, some folding, appear in  <em>Voyages </em>, but none of the Falklands. His portrait forms the frontispiece to the first volume, while his sketch of McCormick Bay (in the Arctic) appears in Vol. 2. The pencil originals of many of his sketches were sold at Christie's, London on 25 September 2002 and are in private hands. There is therefore no shortage of biographical information about this naval surgeon. In addition, we have a critical account of McCormick's career and his personality by AGE Jones, in the  <em>Geographical Journal </em>for 1982, written in part from McCormick's personal papers in the Wellcome Institute, London. Jones's verdict was that McCormick held himself in high regard, but never reached great eminence. Another author, JJ Keevil more kindly calls him 'the Stormy Petrel of naval medicine'.</p>",

        "body": "<p>teacher, public servant, was born on 12 March 1919, the eldest child of Alexander McPhee and his wife Letitia, née Carey. His mother died when he was six and he lived for a time on Saunders Island with his uncle <em>before moving to Stanley to live with his grandmother </em>. His father was working in Camp so at the age of nine he went to the Church House Hostel. When he was 14, he went to Pebble Island to work, first as houseboy and later becoming assistant radio operator and storekeeper.</p><p>On the outbreak of World War II, McPhee was despatched to Marble Mountain, at the west end of Pebble, with two other men and a radio to keep a lookout and to report any sightings via Pebble radio. In 1942 he left Pebble and became a travelling teacher on West Falkland, moving around his beat on horseback. He often told the story of one of his pupils who said 'I like it when Mr McPhee comes because then we get pudding'. He also spent some time teaching at Port Howard where his pupils included some children evacuated from Stanley.</p><p>He moved back to Stanley in 1943 and worked for the Navy at the ammunition storage depot at the Canache before joining the  <em>Fitzroy </em>later that year. In 1944  <em>Fitzroy </em>went south for Operation Tabarin*, an experience which left a lasting impression. On returning to Stanley, he worked with the gun and searchlight crew.</p><p>Later that year McPhee went to Teal Inlet as school teacher/bookkeeper. While there he was chosen to join the FIDF contingent for the Victory Parade in London in 1946. He remained at Teal Inlet until 1952 when he moved to Stanley and began work in the Communications Department (the Harbour Master's and Air Service office). He married Marjorie McCallum on 9 May 1952. In 1953 McPhee went to Douglas Station for 6 months as acting manager and was joined there by his wife and son Terence (b1953). They then moved to Teal Inlet and whilst there had a second son, Ian, (b1954)  <em>and in 1960 went back to Douglas Station. A </em>daughter Natalie was born in 1966. The family moved to Stanley in 1971 and McPhee went to work in the accounts office at the Post Office where he remained until retirement in 1986.</p><p>McPhee played the piano accordion at many dances in Camp and was a member of the T.I. Jive Five and the San Salvador Syncopaters while at Teal Inlet. In Stanley he joined Rowlands Ragtime Band under the leadership of Robert Rowlands: they made an LP in the 1970s.</p><p>In 1978 he had a heart valve replacement operation in London. The valve, from a pig, kept going until 1995 when it was in turn replaced with a more modern version. His wife's death in May 2005 was a tremendous blow and McPhee himself died peacefully among his family at San Carlos on 2 January 2006.</p>",

        "body": "<p>Tabernacle minister, was born on 29 July 1913 in Glasgow, the son of Andrew Alexander McWhan and Mary, née Forrest. He came to the Falkland Islands in September 1934 as an 'independent missionary' after training at the Bible Training Institute in Glasgow. The Tabernacle (later named the United Free Church of the Falkland Islands) had been without a minister for 18 years and McWhan, with his 'hands on' style of ministry, soon built up a flourishing congregation of faithful believers. He introduced a children's Sunday School, prayer and Bible study evenings, a weekly meeting for mothers and toddlers and a sewing group. He formed a choir and organised regular winter 'magic lantern' slide shows and variety shows consisting of songs and poems, music on accordion and piano, shadow shows and small sketches (which he wrote himself). He instigated an annual 'bazaar': goods such as hand-knitted clothing, home-made cakes and garden produce, particularly valuable when such items could become unobtainable in the shops, were sold in aid of church funds. The two-night bazaars ended with suppers for sale to the general public. McWhan also organised annual picnics to nearby beaches for choir members, and Sunday School children and helpers.</p><p>As a young man McWhan had lived in Duns in the Scottish borders and was a member of the Church of Scotland; while on leave in 1941 he was ordained a minister of that Church. Once he had placed the Tabernacle on a firm foundation, he gained financial assistance from the Church through its Colonial and Continental Committee. In 1945 McWhan took temporary charge of the Cathedral in Stanley while there was no priest-in-charge: in fact Bishop <a href=\"/biographies/weller_john\">WELLER</a> offered to ordain him an Anglican minister and give him charge of the Cathedral, but he declined.  </p><p>McWhan was active in the wider community of the Islands: weekly visiting in the hospital and regular visits to the homes of Stanley, irrespective of whether residents were members of any church, were high priorities for him, as were his frequent visits by boat and horseback to farms outside Stanley. McWhan was chaplain to the Boys' Brigade. He served on the overseas scholarship selection committee of the colony which recommended students to be sent for further education to Uruguay and he was entrusted with the care of the first boys awarded a scholarship to a grammar school in Britain, and travelled with them for the long sea voyage in 1952.</p><p>McWhan was a nominated unofficial member of LegCo and was active in the welfare of the elderly, being instrumental in changes to the law relating to the payment of old age pensions.</p><p>During World War II, McWhan was commissioned into the Falkland Islands Defence Force as a chaplain.  He was a familiar figure among the naval ships based in the Falklands and was serving on board the flagship of Commodore <a href=\"/biographies/harwood_sir\">HARWOOD</a> just before he sailed to encounter the <em>Graf Spee </em>in 1939. In 1942 he was appointed Free Church Chaplain to the 14th battalion of the West Yorkshire Regiment. He was a colony information officer and a member of the committee which censored mail. Nearly every day McWhan took an early morning swim in the harbour.</p><p>McWhan was also well-known and greatly respected by the leaders and members of a succession of expeditions to Antarctica. His own contribution to the geography of the South Atlantic brought him an FRGS. In 1948 McWhan was awarded an MBE for conspicuous public service to both the community and the armed forces. In 1967 after his death, the government's coastal vessel, in a unique tribute, was named M/V <em>Forrest </em>in his honour.</p><p>In 1944 McWhan resurrected the Colony's weekly newspaper and, for a number of years, was its editor. <em>The Falkland Islands Weekly News </em>, with an annual subscription rate of 12 shillings, published government gazette notices, sports news, church information, war news and local advertisements. Wishing more people to 'come and see for themselves', McWhan wrote <em>The Falkland Islands Today </em>, in 1952: it clearly demonstrates his knowledge and commitment to the Islands. He also wrote two religious booklets, <em>Fact Finding from the Bible </em>and <em>Just a Minute </em>. In the 1950s he gained a Doctorate of Divinity by correspondence and thesis from an American university.</p><p>McWhan married Nellie Ennenga in Stanley on the 19th March 1940: she was the daughter of Jessie Bartram, an elderly widow who ran the boarding house in which McWhan lodged. The McWhans had no children.</p><p>While on leave, McWhan died suddenly of cancer at the Royal Infirmary, Falkirk, Scotland on 25 August 1965. He is buried in Duns. His wife returned to the Islands, and died some ten years later in Stanley where she is buried.</p><p>For virtually the whole of his adult life McWhan served the church and community of the Islands. He was greatly loved, treating everyone with respect and affection. He was a humble and gracious man, a person of few words and a serious disposition, often appearing to be deep in thought. He was generous and unstinting with his time, a man with high standards for himself, and also for his 'flock' who knew to expect a visit from him if they missed Sunday church. Many people still remember McWhan in the form of stories: how he 'was always at Tab and in and out of our home'; how he upset a farm manager by spending the night in the wool shed after he had missed the launch back to the boat; how he became lost on a walk from Darwin to Stanley and worried the authorities; how he 'was like a father to me'; how he would not welcome intoxicated people into his home. Such stories provide a glimpse both of the man's independent spirit and also of the great love that McWhan had for the people of the Falkland Islands. The re-establishment of the Tabernacle from small beginnings to a strong Christian congregation makes McWhan himself a success story.</p>",

He therefore asked the Viceroy to consider his situation in that light and to consider what course of action it was proper for him to take. On 4 March 1780 he wrote again to the Viceroy, who had ordered him on 22 October the previous year 'to destroy every object found in Port Egmont as part of his reconnaissance of that area', explaining that he had no vessels suitable for that purpose, nor if the need arose to relay any urgent news to the River Plate. Medina hoped that the Viceroy would provide the necessary assistance when convenient. He was relieved by Jacinto <a href=\"/biographies/altolaguirre_jacinto\">ALTOLAGUIRRE</a> in February 1781, when he returned to the River Plate with the crew of his ship in the merchant frigate  <em>Nuestra Señora de los Dolores </em>, with some salvaged goods he had been ordered to collect.

In February 1797 Medina y Torres was detached to the Falklands in the  <em>Atrevida </em>, taking over from José de <a href=\"/biographies/aldana_y\">ALDANA</a> as governor on 20 February 1797, remaining there until relieved by Viana on 17 March 1798. Medina y Torres took over as governor again during the first days of April 1799, serving there until relieved once again by Viana on 15 March 1800. One of Medina y Torres's first routine duties was to report to Viceroy Pedro Melo de Portugal on the condition of the buildings and batteries. He also reported that the lack of farm hands ( <em>peones de campo </em>) posed a considerable human and practical problem because the shortfall of manpower had to be made up by using convicts as labourers. The convicts, however, successfully took on essential farming and cattle ranching tasks, but this deficiency of manpower could, in the governor's opinion, 'bring about the demise of the colony'. In a further submission, dated 25 February 1797, Medina y Torres reported the findings of a junta called by the out-going Aldana at which he, as the incoming governor, had been invited to take part. As a result three convicts who, in spite of commendable conduct, had more than served their terms without receiving any remission to their sentence were being returned to Montevideo with Aldana on board the  <em>Santa Escolástica </em>. There were, however, other convicts in the colony whose release was overdue 'but the meeting did not dare to free them until the viceroy decided what should be done'. During his second term as governor, when submitting his requirements for provisions and stores to Viceroy Antonio Olaguer y Feliu, on 9 April 1798, Medina y Torres asked for two spare heavy anchors, a 120-fathom length of 15 inch hemp cable and a 9 inch hawser, which were needed for the safety of the vessels at anchor in Puerto de la Soledad. He explained that these vessels were on station for periods of 12 to 14 months and therefore at risk of being wrecked by the frequent violent storms experienced, if additional anchoring equipment was not available in an emergency.</p><p>On his return to Montevideo in 1800, Medina y Torres had expected to serve a third term as governor at Puerto de la Soledad and relieve Viana, but he suffered an attack of epilepsy from which he nearly died. As a result,  <em>Teniente de navío </em>Ramón FERNÁNDEZ Y VILLEGAS was appointed in command of the  <em>Atrevida </em>and sent to Puerto de la Soledad to relieve Viana. Medina y Torres, with sympathetic support from José <a href=\"/biographies/bustamante_y\">BUSTAMANTE</a>, the senior naval officer at Montevideo, was given command of a division of gunboats assigned to Buenos Aires, before eventually taking passage in the brig  <em>Paloma  </em>and returning to Spain on 17 March 1802. His final promotion was to  <em>capitán de navío </em>on 17 October 1809. He retired on 5 August 1815, when he was granted the rank of  <em>brigadier de Real Armada </em>.</p>",

He first took over from Ramón de <a href=\"/biographies/clairac_y\">CLAIRAC</a> on 25 May 1786 and was relieved by Clairac again on 15 May 1787. He returned for a second term as governor, taking over from Clairac on 10 April 1788, serving until 16 May 1789 when he was relieved once again by Clairac. On 10 April 1788 he submitted a manifest, in which he stated that the establishment, including the crew of the <em>San Gil </em>, consisted of 13 officers, 28 soldiers forming the garrison, 105 seamen and 22 convicts. The livestock comprised 2180 cattle, 116 horses and 66 geese. His activities, as shown in his reports to the Viceroy were similar to most of the preceding governors, namely supervision of the welfare of the civilians and military personnel, proper functioning of the <em>presidio </em>(convict colony), repair to buildings and the maintenance of vessels. In particular he had to attend to the state of preparedness of the ships assigned to carry out the prescribed reconnaissance of the coastal areas under his command to see that no foreigners, especially the British, had attempted to breach his territorial jurisdiction. Mesa personally undertook the yearly visit to Port Egmont and produced a plan of the harbour. In March 1787 he sent a special report to Viceroy Marqués de Loreto concerning the poor showing in the number of cattle that year. During the months of June, July and August the previous year he had been obliged to provide the full ration of fresh meat to everyone in the settlement, because there were no adequate reserves of salt meat for the full year. In this situation, and so as not to increase the slaughter of the cattle, he had supplied meat from the <em>San Gil </em>, keeping back only sufficient for her return to Montevideo. As a result the cattle had not increased at the usual rate, while there had been a great loss of calves in the unusual cold winter.</p><p>On 10 April, as he began his second tour as governor, Mesa gave the Viceroy a fairly complete description of the state and condition of the settlement at that time. He did this in the form of a detailed exposé intended to be read in conjunction with a table showing at a glance the establishment of the settlement and a list of 36 buildings existing at Puerto de la Soledad at that date. Each numbered item in this list included the use of the building and the material it was made of, either stone or turf. On 12 April 1789 Mesa wrote to the Viceroy, mentioning the baptism of two Pampa Indians at Puerto de la Soledad and the sad state of the church, which was built of turf. On 16 May 1789 Mesa was relieved once again by Clairac.</p>",

        "body": "<p>Argentine commandant, was French, but little is known about him. His date of birth is not on record, and his Christian names are also in doubt. The historian Paul <a href=\"/biographies/groussac_francois\">GROUSSAC</a>, also of French origin, refers to him as Juan (or Jean) Mestivier. As is the Argentine custom, his Christian names have been hispanicized in Argentine literature. He is first mentioned campaigning with the 7th cavalry regiment near Bahia Blanca (against the Indians) as a first lieutenant. In 1828 he was promoted captain, and apparently brevet major on 28 December 1829. He married a local lady, Gertrudis Sanchez.</p><p>With <a href=\"?q=node/469\">VERNET</a> unwilling to return to the Falklands after the <em>Lexington </em> Raid, Mestivier was appointed by President ROSAS interim <em>Comandante Politico y Militar </em> on 10 September 1832. This was published in the <em>British Packet and Argentine News  </em>on 15 September and was the only lawful and correctly gazetted appointment of an Argentine commandant of the Falklands. It was a direct snub to the Americans, whose negotiator, Francis Baylies, had despaired of reaching a solution to the disputed fisheries of the Falklands after the <em>Lexington </em> Raid and was preparing to leave Buenos Aires. But more importantly Mestivier’s appointment provoked a diplomatic protest dated 28 September 1832 by the British minister in Buenos Aires, Henry Fox.</p><p>Mestivier sailed for the Falklands on 23 September on the schooner <em>Sarandi </em>, with his wife in an advanced stage of pregnancy - shortly after they arrived on 6 October 1832 she gave birth. On 10 October Mestivier claimed the Islands again in a formal ceremony. With him he brought a motley garrison of 25 troops, and their wives and children; some of the troops were criminals sentenced to service in the army. The Negro sergeant, Manuel Saenz Valiente, had earlier murdered the commander of the Argentine garrison on the island of Martin Garcia in the River Plate. A handful of Vernet’s men came as well: William <a href=\"?q=node/154\">DICKSON and Henry Metcalf among them. Mathew <a href=\"?q=node/78\">BRISBANE</a> also came - but as pilot on the <em>Sarandi </em>, not as a Vernet employee.</p><p>Mestivier imposed harsh discipline on his men. The <em>Sarandi </em> left on patrol on 21 November and on 30 November, just nine weeks after his arrival, a mutiny broke out, fuelled by drink. No reliable details appear in the main Argentine history books. But Mestivier was murdered on the threshold of his house (Vernet’s house) by four of the mutineers, who shot and then bayoneted him. His young wife saw it all and was left traumatised. His second-in-command Adjutant Juan Antonio Gomila, who was implicated in the mutiny himself, then installed himself in that house - to the horror of Mestivier’s widow, with whom he proposed to share a bedroom! One Argentine historian (Antonio Monatarcé Lastra) reports that the mutineers also murdered the couple who ran the bar. They next seized the best of the establishment’s horses and left. Mestivier was buried a few hours after he was killed, but his grave is not marked.</p><p>The mutiny was witnessed by the crew of the British sealing schooner <em>Rapid </em>, which was undergoing repairs in the Carenage at Port Louis. The French whaling vessel <em>Jean Jacques </em> arrived the next day. The crews of the <em>Rapid </em> and <em>Jean Jacques </em> took Mestivier’s widow on board to protect her. Then, gauchos and armed men from the <em>Jean Jacques </em> surprised the mutineers near Estancia. They were put in irons on board the <em>Rapid </em>.</p><p>The <em>Sarandi </em> arrived back late on the night of 29 December 1832. Next morning, its commander José Antonio Pinedo took control of the situation, and began an investigation. But the British warship <em>Clio </em> (Captain <a href=\"?q=node/352\">ONSLOW</a>) had already re-claimed the Falklands at Port Egmont, and arrived off Port Louis on 2 January 1833. Onslow urged all civilians to stay, but told the <em>Sarandi </em> and the remaining garrison to leave, which they did on 5 January. The <em>Rapid </em> sailed with them taking the mutineers to Buenos Aires. Two of Vernet’s gauchos and their wives are known to have left then also, and three other gauchos probably went too.</p><p>In Buenos Aires the British repossession of the Falklands caused an immediate governmental protest. Mestivier’s murderers were tried and seven condemned to death. The <em>British Packet and Argentine News </em> covered the sentence and execution, describing how the mutineers were shot on 8 February in front of the garrison of the capital and their bodies afterwards hung up on a gallows for four hours. Mestivier’s widow bitterly criticised the relative clemency accorded to Adjutant Gomila whom she - and others - considered just as guilty. Two other men were sentenced to flogging and imprisonment, which they served by extending their service in the army, a common practice in those days.</p>",

        "body": "<p>governor, was born on 12 July 1870, the son of Dr James Middleton of Stow, Midlothian. He was educated at Sedbergh and Edinburgh University. In 1901 Middleton entered the Colonial Service as an assistant district commissioner in Southern Nigeria. When the Colony of Lagos and its protected territory were amalgamated with the Protectorate of Southern Nigeria in 1906, he became chief assistant colonial secretary. In 1907 he was appointed assistant colonial secretary in Mauritius. In 1913 Middleton became colonial secretary of Mauritius. In 1920 he became governor of the Falkland Islands. He arrived in Stanley with his wife on Christmas Day of that year, landing from RMS <em>Orita  </em>to a salute of guns from HMS  <em>Weymouth </em>. After inspecting a guard of honour from the Defence Force, he took the oaths of office in the Council Chamber and then, according to an account in the  <em>Falkland Islands Magazine </em>: 'made a short speech in the course of which he mentioned that it was his desire to administer the government in such a way as to promote the best interests of the Colony and its inhabitants'. </em></p><p>Middleton's early years in office were notable for the appointments of the first government geologist (HA <strong>BAKER) </strong>and forestry officer (<strong>REID),</strong>together with efforts to re-establish a fur seal industry. These initiatives were given impetus by a serious slump in wool prices in 1921, which left many farms in financial difficulties and led to much reflection on the economic future of the Islands. Middleton made an historic speech to LegCo on 23 July 1924 on the state of the sheep farming industry. His speech revealed both his extensive knowledge and his deep concern for those working within the industry: 'I have made it my duty to collect such information as I could'. It outlined the problems of the deteriorating quality of the grassland, and the subsequent decline in the aggregate number of sheep carried. A number of the leading farmers in the Colony shared Middleton's assessment of the state of the main industry of the Islands in the 1920s. As a result of his speech, the Falkland Islands' Government agreed to fund the work of Hugh <a href=\"/biographies/munro_hugh\">MUNRO</a>, a senior stock inspector from the Department of Agriculture in New Zealand, from the Land Sales Fund. Munro's Report, published at the end of 1924, was the first systematic examination of the condition of the natural resources of the Falklands, and how they might be more effectively managed and exploited. To accompany the Munro Report, Middleton wrote a long and comprehensive memorandum on the sheep farming industry of the Islands (Middleton, J;  <em>Memorandum on the Sheep Farming Industry in the Falkland Islands </em>; London 1924). This recalled that thirty years before Munro's investigations in 1895 another much shorter Report had been written by a New Zealand Stock Inspector John Mowat which also expressed considerable concern about the deterioration of the pasturage of the Falkland Islands.</p><p>Middleton's speech and the report by Hugh Munro were to result in the building of an experimental farm at Green Patch (near the headwaters of Berkeley Sound). Middleton's philosophy was based on the adage that 'seeing was believing' and thus the only way to improve the situation, and to educate farmers into accepting new farming methods, was a working example of good practice.</p><p>Middleton made no secret of his admiration for Munro's work; the Colonial Secretary wrote to Munro (in November 1924) thus:</p><blockquote><blockquote>I am desired to convey to you an expression of the thanks of the Government for the services which you have rendered to the country in presenting so able an exposition of the damage to the pastures which has resulted from the system of farming in the past, of the defective methods of farm management and of the remedial measures which should be adopted. I am to convey to you the Governor's particular appreciation of the fact that you have, in the course of your investigations and discussions with the farmers, been successful in securing and retaining the goodwill and respect of those whose methods and farming practices you have found it necessary to criticise.</blockquote></blockquote><p>Middleton was also concerned with the economic disposal of surplus sheep, and he considered that the requirement for the establishment of a refrigeration factory to be most urgent. This was the first time that this suggestion had been made, and the idea was raised again by Governor <a href=\"/biographies/henniker_heaton\">HENNIKER HEATON</a> in 1939. Governor Sir Miles <a href=\"/biographies/clifford_sir\">CLIFFORD</a> championed the idea after World War II, and the Ajax Bay freezer complex was eventually built on San Carlos Water between 1949 and 1953. Another major concern of Middleton was the need for the various elements of the farming industry to cooperate in the marketing of its products.</p><p>Middleton's initiatives, and practical reforms to enable a more sustainable agricultural system on the Falkland Islands, were regrettably soon destroyed by the activities of his successor as governor - Arnold <a href=\"/biographies/hodson_sir\">HODSON</a> - who ensured that the experimental farm was closed down within a few months of his arrival in the Falkland Islands.</p><p>During the early 1920s Middleton became very concerned about the diminishing numbers of Fur Seals in the Islands, and he drafted The Seal Fishery (Consolidation) Ordinance 1921 to protect the existing stocks; this legislation was swiftly enacted.On his instructions the government naturalist (JE <a href=\"/biographies/hamilton_james\">HAMILTON)</a> visited Elephant Jason Island, Bird Island and Volunteer Rocks between October 1921 and March 1923, and his report showed that although the exact number of Fur Seals could not be stated with complete accuracy, nevertheless the numbers were fewer than had been indicated in earlier reports. The government naturalist recommended that a 3-inch naval gun be placed on Elephant Jason Island to deter poachers. By March 1922 a guardhouse was built on Elephant Jason Island. Cattle were landed to provide milk and meat for the three personnel, and a 12-pounder gun was placed in position. Seal fishery officers were appointed in 1922 and armed officers were placed at major rookeries during the breeding season. Fur sealing was prohibited. HMCS <em>Afterglow </em>was purchased (at a cost of £8,800) to assist with protection of the rookeries. Middleton's actions were criticised within the Colony because of fears that the cost of this protection could not be met from the revenues that accrued to the Government from the licensing of the sealing industry. The effectiveness of Middleton's work to conserve the Fur Seal stocks was soon dissipated by his successor, Arnold Hodson, who ensured that the  <em>Afterglow  </em>was sold off and the guard on Jason Island withdrawn.</p><p>Middleton was also concerned with the potential threat to the stocks of whales after technology had improved sufficiently to allow the change from shore-based whaling to pelagic* whaling. He considered that there was a possibility of the extinction of whales in the Antarctic, and wrote in September 1926 to the Colonial Office that 'the control and suppression of pelagic whaling was impossible'. Middleton faced enormous practical difficulties of supervising the Southern Ocean: 'the absence of a patrol boat meant that the Governor has no means of controlling the floating factories' Middleton fully understood that an added complication to the problems of regulation and control of whaling was caused by the fact that while early pelagic whaling was within Islands Dependencies waters, and thus under government control, the later stages of pelagic whaling were well outside the Governor's bailiwick, and therefore beyond government control. Middleton had shown a deep appreciation of the true nature of the situation concerning the whaling industry and he enthusiastically supported the research work of the Discovery Expeditions.</p><p>In 1927 Middleton became the governor of the Gambia, and one year later governor of Newfoundland. The later period of his governorship of Newfoundland was seriously marred when he became embroiled in the political scandals that engulfed the administration of Prime Minister Sir Richard Squires. Squires was accused of falsifying minutes of the Executive Council and in April 1932 10,000 people marched to the House of Assembly to protest at the activities of the government, and there was serious rioting. Middleton investigated the matter and he controversially declared that he found no evidence to support the allegation that the minutes had been tampered with. Richard Squires resigned in June 1932, and although Middleton was held in high personal regard, he felt honour bound to resign as governor.</p><p>He was awarded the CMG in 1916. He was knighted (KBE) in 1924 and in 1931 he was made a KCMG. Middleton married Mabel Granville, the widow of RK Granville and the daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel Notley, of Wiltshire. There were no children of the marriage. On leaving Newfoundland, Middleton retired to Wiltshire; his wife died in 1947, and he died on 5 November 1954. He was a far-sighted and imaginative man of vision who had planned for the future of the Colony. A later governor, Henniker-Heaton, who served under Middleton in the Falkland Islands as colonial secretary, wrote to  <em>The Times  </em>on 10 November 1954:</p><blockquote><blockquote>A special tribute should be paid to the memory of the late Sir John Middleton. He was as nearly the perfect Colonial Civil servant as any individual could be... As Governor of the Falkland Islands and its dependencies his work for improvements in the sheep farms and in the control of the whaling industry was of great value; he also re-established the fur seal in the colony.</blockquote></blockquote>",

As a young man, he travelled to Europe with his family and they visited the Salesian House in Italy where Don John Bosco (later canonised), the founder of the Salesian Congregation, lived. Bosco had a profound influence on Migone who in 1879 began his studies in Buenos Aires to become a priest as a member of the Salesian Congregation. He was ordained in June 1887, and in November 1889 he arrived in Stanley to be assistant priest at St Mary's Catholic Church which had become a Salesian mission the previous year. In November 1891 Migone returned because of ill health to Montevideo and shortly afterwards became director of the Salesian College in Santiago. In January 1895 he was back in the Falklands as assistant priest but remained only until December that year when he left to do mission work with the Indians in Patagonia and the Pampas. During his first two periods in the Falkland Islands Migone contributed monthly weather observations which were published in the <em>Falkland Islands Magazine. </em></p><p>On 3 January 1905 Migone arrived in the Falkland Islands for the third time on taking up his appointment as priest in charge of St Mary's Catholic Church and remained until his death in 1937. As an early task, he undertook the improvement of St Mary's School and succeeded in 1907 in recruiting as teachers a group of nuns, Sisters of the Congregation of Maria Auxiliadora, the sister Congregation to the Salesian Fathers. St Mary's School had Protestant as well as Catholic pupils and Migone by local fund-raising sought to ensure that no child was turned away because its parents were unable to pay the fees. One of the nuns was head teacher of the school but he taught Spanish, French, technical drawing and woodwork both to the pupils and, in the evenings, to adults.</p><p>At some time before 1913 Migone started the first cinema in the Islands on the school premises. He said later in his book <em>33 Anos de Vida Malvinera (33 Years of Falklands Life)  </em>that he wished to:</p><blockquote><blockquote>provide recreation and entertainment for young people who not having any other means of entertainment, used to mis-spend their hours in the pub, the only meeting place ... we also learned how to make use of it for educating children.</blockquote></blockquote><p>Showings of films of educational value were open to pupils of both St Mary's School and the Government School.</p><p>In 1913, Migone installed electric lighting in St Mary's Church and in the school, which the <em>Falkland Islands' Magazine </em>in August 1913 reported as being 'a great asset to his Cinematograph and ... a great success'. Admission was charged for showings intended for general audiences. These made a profit and the profits were donated to local and overseas charities. Some showings for children were free, and on occasions up to 200 children attended. He asked his cinema audiences: 'no stampee de feet, no kickee de stage' and this became a catchphrase by which many people remembered him in later years. He is reputed to have spoken five languages but it appears that his English may, at least in his earlier years in the Islands, have been highly accented.</p><p>In 1914 Migone helped to form a branch of the Red Cross in Stanley. Acutely aware of the sufferings of the French and Belgian populations in World War I he sent some of the profits from his cinema to relieve their suffering. Governor <a href=\"/biographies/allardyce_sir\">ALLARDYCE</a> in the early years of the war had supported this but Migone in <em>33 Anos de Vida Malvinera  </em>records an unfortunate public rift with Governor <a href=\"/biographies/young_sir\">YOUNG</a> in 1916 over his wish to send funds to help the widows and orphans of French soldiers killed at Verdun. He also mentions in that book the arguments he had in later years with Governor <a href=\"/biographies/hodson_sir\">HODSON</a> in which he asserted the validity of the Argentine sovereignty claim.</p><p>Migone of course undertook the usual duties of a Roman Catholic priest. He visited the sick and his parishioners and others, both in Stanley and in Camp. He became a very well-known and respected figure in the Falkland Islands. He was a good carpenter and did work himself on the school and the church, until in 1930 he became ill and had to undergo an operation. His health gradually failed. Nonetheless he continued to carry on his duties as best he could. When he was not able to walk to church he celebrated Mass at his house in Barrack Street, when he was hardly able to stand. He refused to return to the Salesian house in Buenos Aires because he wished to end his days in the Islands. About three months before his death he was taken to the King Edward VII Memorial Hospital Stanley and died there on 1 November 1937 (All Saints' Day), after just over 50 years as a priest. A large congregation of Catholics and non-Catholics attended his Requiem Mass, including local officials and many ordinary people who wished, in the words of Montague <a href=\"/biographies/craigie-halkett_montague\">CRAIGIE-HALKETT</a>, the acting governor, to honour his good work and good example during his many years in the Falkland Islands. He was buried in Stanley Cemetery.</p>",

        "body": "<p>senior chaplain, was born in Portsmouth on 11 March 1936, the son of a Falkland Islands mother, Beatrice Orissa Bender and of William Robert Millam who had served with the Royal Navy in the Islands from 1921-2. He was educated at Bromley County GS and later at Cheltenham GS and went on to St David's College, Lampeter and Ridley Hall, Cambridge. After three years teaching in Birmingham, he was ordained priest in 1964.</p><p>Millam was steeped in Falkland Islands lore as a child and met frequent guests from the Islands, so when the opportunity came to serve as senior chaplain at Christ Church Cathedral Stanley it was as if a local boy had made good. He hit the world's headlines in September, 1966, shortly after arriving, when he, later joined by Fr <a href=\"/biographies/roel_rudolph\">ROEL</a>, successfully dealt with the 18 armed hijackers of the <a href=\"/biographies/condor_group\">CONDOR</a> Group who had taken hostages aboard the Aerolinas Argentinas DC4 plane forced to land on Stanley Racecourse. When negotiating the release of women and children, Millam managed to smuggle Terry <a href=\"/biographies/peck_terry\">PECK</a>, the chief of police, on to a departing Landrover under his clerical cloak. Following this incident, Millam, with the tabernacle minister (Rev Paul <a href=\"/biographies/charman_paul\">CHARMAN,)</a> invited the Rev Dr Arnoldo Canclini, a prominent Baptist Argentine historian, to the Islands and Dr Canclini preached in both the Cathedral (on 28 May 1967) and the Tabernacle, the first Argentine national to do so.</p><p>When Lord <a href=\"/biographies/chalfont_alun\">CHALFONT</a> visited the Islands in October 1968 the Millams were asked to entertain him at the Deanery, where Chalfont expected Millam, as an 'expatriate' to support the British Government's proposals for closer involvement with Argentina. But Chalfont left disillusioned as the Millams unequivocally sided with all Falkland Islanders in their efforts to remain British.</p><p>For the Cathedral's 75th Anniversary (21 February 1967) Millam planned celebrations with a Souvenir Brochure and Service of Thanksgiving. Together with WH <a href=\"/biographies/thompson_willoughby\">THOMPSON</a> (colonial secretary) he mounted an exhibition of the Colony's history in the Town Hall. The Cathedral was floodlit for the first time in history. Millam organised the celebrations to mark the centenary of the consecration of Bishop <a href=\"/biographies/stirling_waite\">STIRLING</a> as first Bishop of the Falkland Islands, on 21 December 1969, with a four-set commemorative stamp issue, centenary covers and the first ever over-printed aerogramme. The postmaster agreed on a special frank which Millam designed for letters posted in the Cathedral postbox, the first such authorised postbox not on government property in the Islands' philatelic history. With Alma Draycott, Millam ran the FIBS Newsletter from 1967-70, and was frequently called upon to make announcements, a significant one in May 1970 being a request for mattresses to plug the hole in the side of the <em>Great Britain </em>until quick-setting concrete took effect. With the help of naval and BAS personnel he restored the Cathedral clock chimes which had been silent for 21 years, resulting in many gifts of broken clocks for repair and sale at the Cathedral Bazaar.</p><p>Millam undertook extensive Camp visiting by Landrover, Beaver seaplane, boats, horseback and foot, including a visit to Keppel Island. Services were held in all settlements with occasional baptisms and weddings, and prayers said in most outside houses during his stay. He also visited South Georgia in 1967 and said prayers at Sir Ernest SHACKLETON's graveside, and by request, conducted a service in Grytviken church. As chaplain to the Supreme Court and the nearest thing to a trained social worker, the acting judge, WH Thompson, occasionally adjourned cases to the Deanery if he thought 'the Padre' with agreement of the parties concerned could resolve matters (usually of a domestic nature). Close ecumenical relations were formed in his time with the Week of Prayer for Christian Unity being observed by all three churches for the first time in 1968. With D'Earle <a href=\"/biographies/draycott_dearle\">DRAYCOTT</a>, (superintendent of education,) Millam advised on the establishment of a Falkland Islands school boarding house in Montevideo and visited it during mid-term leave in 1968. In March 1968, at the request of Len Hill (of Birdland, Gloucestershire), supported by Peter <a href=\"/biographies/scott_sir\">SCOTT</a>, he exported 60 penguins to England with only one dying in transit.</p><p>Returning to England in June 1970, Millam was a founder member of the United Kingdom Falkland Islands Committee (1972) and became its welfare representative. He was the first person to broadcast to the Islands on the BBC World Service in April 1982, and read the second lesson at Falkland Islands Evensong in St. Paul's Cathedral on the following Palm Sunday. He spoke to a packed audience of Lords and Commons to emphasise the sacrifice Falkland Islanders had made in the defence of Britain. Millam has tirelessly fought the Islanders' cause in the media and in committee and with Bill Hunter <a href=\"/biographies/christie_eric\">CHRISTIE</a> was instrumental in obtaining Britain citizenship and UK Right of Abode for Falkland Islanders.</p><p>He was vicar of Pulloxhill with Flitton, 1970-79; St Paul's, Luton, 1979-89; and Chipping Campden with Ebrington, 1989-94 where he was a founder member of Chipping Campden Rotary Club.  In 1992 he was chaplain to the high sheriff of Gloucestershire and, in retirement, a member of Chichester Community Health Council. As a hymn writer one of his hymns, 'O they that go to sea in ships', was broadcast on BBC on Sea Sunday, 1996.</p><p>He married Jillian Helen Ridgway in 1960. They have two sons, Kevin John (b1964) and Andrew Peter (b1973) and two daughters Rosalind Caroline (b1962) and Sarah Elizabeth (b1972).</p>",

        "body": "<p>Miller contemplated farming in South Africa or Australia but his heart was set in the Falklands and he was delighted to accept the offer to manage Roy Cove, another West Falkland farm, when it was offered in 1932, although it was a smaller farm carrying about half the sheep of Hill Cove. Roy Cove had previously been managed by Howard <a href=\"/biographies/clement_howard\">CLEMENT</a> of another well-respected sheepfarming family who were always close to the Millers. Miller, whose declared ambition was to be a good stockman, set about his task with youthful vigour, introducing new stock from New Zealand and Patagonia and well achieving his ambition. He was, however, more renowned for his work on grassland, as he recognised at an early stage that improvement to stock needed to be matched by better feed and controlled grazing. Despite scepticism from some quarters, his costings and estimates of return on investment proved accurate.</p><p>Not an easy man to debate with, Miller was well-respected as a pioneer sheep farmer particularly in the post-war period. His advice was sought at all levels and he was an elected member of LegCo for West Falkland from 1956-1960 and from 1964-1971. Following his retirement in 1970, he represented Stanley from 1971 to 1976. He also served on Executive Council and during the political crisis in 1968, with three other members of Council, broke his Oath of Secrecy in a direct appeal to the House of Commons over the British government's secret talks with Argentina which had culminated in a memorandum of understanding. Miller backed that up on a visit to the UK during which he castigated a Member of Parliament, who was openly dismissive of the Colony's future, at the House of Commons. He married Betty, the great, great granddaughter of Sergeant-Major Henry <a href=\"/biographies/felton_henry\">FELTON</a> of the <a href=\"/biographies/pensioners_the\">PENSIONERS</a> on 20 February 1933. Their marriage was a long and happy one with Betty, an accomplished rider and keen on fishing, renowned for her hospitality. Betty was equally outspoken in support of the Islanders, and the author recalls a leading Argentine politician saying in the 1970s that if they failed to negotiate transfer of sovereignty soon they would have to take the Islands by force and in style, 'not by overcoming Betty Miller on the jetty brandishing her handbag'.</p><p>The Millers had four boys: Alan, who managed Port San Carlos after the 1982 conflict, Nigel, who commanded RMS <em>Darwin </em>for a while, Simon, who manages a market garden and Tim, who was injured in the conflict and established the hydroponic garden. Syd Miller was awarded the CBE in 1979. He edited the <em>Falkland Islands Journal </em>from 1975-1990, writing a series of articles on the history of the FIC. His book <em>A Life of our Choice  </em>epitomized his life and contribution to the Islands. He died in Stanley on 4 July 1992, and his wife died in 2004.</p><p><a href=\"/biographies/arrowsmith_sir\">See Image 12</a><br><a href=\"?q=node/63\">See Image 50</a></p>",

Harry as he liked to be known was educated at Hulme Grammar School in Manchester and later started studying to be an accountant. During World War II he joined the RAF and was shipped overseas to Canada for final training. There he met Madeline Edmond and they were married in May 1945 at Oak Lake Manitoba. They had two daughters, Carrie (b1945) and Fiona (b1949).</p><p>In 1945 Milne left the RAF and to resume his accountancy studies joined the firm of Leach, Johnson and Travis. In 1964 he was appointed as the Falkland Islands Company accountant in the Falklands. The family arrived in the Islands in January 1965 and straightaway took to the way of life there. Milne became involved in local affairs being the treasurer and committee member of a number of organizations for many years, including the Colony Club and Stanley Sports Association. When he first arrived he became an active member of the Tabernacle (Free Church) but later in life embraced Roman Catholicism, his wife Madeline's religion, and was a regular worshipper at St Mary's Church in Stanley.</p><p>In 1974 Milne was appointed as Stanley manager of the FIC, a position he held until 1982.  He was due to retire from the Company on 9 April 1982, but with the Argentine invasion on 2 April of that year it was mutually agreed between Milne and Terry Spruce the manager designate, that it would be better for all concerned if his retirement was delayed until the Islands were liberated.  He was convinced that it would only be a short matter of time until the Union flag was again flying over Stanley.</p><p>He eventually retired in September 1982 and decided, with his wife, to stay in the Islands.  They bought a property at Hebe Place in Stanley, where he opened a small shop specializing in Falkland Islands stamps, philatelic goods and books. He also carried on providing accountancy services for a number of farms in the Falklands. His philatelic interest embraced all corners of the world, as he despatched new issues to them as a service and, as a member of the Falkland Islands Philatelic Study Group was in contact with a large number of friends around the world.</p><p>In 1989, due to failing health he and his wife returned to England and settled in Northumberland, where he died in September 1990. His wife now lives in Devon near her younger daughter Fiona, while their elder daughter Carrie still lives in the Islands.

        "body": "<p>businessman, was born in Barking, Essex on 5 April 1923, the only son of Francis and Lena Sophia, née Edwards. Educated in Essex, the outbreak of war in 1939 disrupted his further education and career plans and following service in the Home Guard he joined the Army at 18 in January 1942. He served with an amphibious unit of DUKWs in Europe in 1944-5 and was then sent to Palestine until demobilisation at the end of 1946.</p><p>He followed a strict career plan in civilian life, gaining experience in manufacturing, wholesaling and insurance whilst acquiring a professional commercial qualification. He joined the Falkland Islands Company in June 1950 and relished the challenges of working for a Royal Chartered Company with its diverse interests. His first visit to the Islands was in June 1953 when he stayed for some months to learn about the Company's trading and their agency operations in Punta Arenas and Montevideo. During this first visit he developed a high regard for Islanders and their way of life but realised that the Company needed to make changes at farm settlements, particularly in the treatment of single workers after working hours and in the greater utilisation of farm buildings.</p><p>Mitchell was also concerned over the economic struggle of the Falkland Islands Government and the disparate taxation payments of the British registered companies, including the FIC between the UK and the Falklands. The Korean War, for example, brought about a sharp increase in wool prices and farm profits reached record levels but for FIC aggregate taxation exceeded 66% of which only 17½% accrued to the Islands. Relations between the Falkland Islands Government and the FIC were strained after the Ajax Bay freezer debacle and representations about taxation were particularly sensitive. However, the situation changed when Edwin <a href=\"/biographies/arrowsmith_sir\">ARROWSMITH</a> became Governor. Mitchell prepared and submitted a paper on behalf of all British registered companies proposing changes in the system of taxation which would be highly beneficial to the Falklands. These were, basically:</p><p>The proposals, although not affecting locally registered sheep farms, were surprisingly not well received in treasury circles in Stanley but the governor wanted them pursued and invited Mitchell to attend a meeting of ExCo to elaborate on them and to respond to questions, which he did. Legislation was introduced and resulted in very substantial revenue increases for the Islands without increasing the overall taxation liabilities of the British companies. At the same time Mitchell brought to an end the anomaly of a high proportion of FI Government subsidy for the mailship operation being lost to the UK by registering Darwin Shipping Ltd locally, which resulted in a taxation liability only arising there.</p><p>In 1968 Mitchell became embroiled in political controversy following the disclosure by unofficial members of ExCo that the British Government had reached a Memorandum of Understanding with the Argentine Government over sovereignty of the Islands. With no independent presence in the UK, AG <a href=\"/biographies/barton_arthur\">BARTON</a> sent Mitchell a copy of their appeal to British parliamentarians with a request that he organise media support and meetings for him prior to his arrival in the UK. This Mitchell did and shortly afterwards was introduced to a Lincoln's Inn barrister, Bill Hunter <a href=\"/biographies/christie_eric\">CHRISTIE</a>, by the FIC chairman, a Lincoln's Inn solicitor. The two quickly formed a strong relationship which proved crucial to the Islanders' cause with Christie providing the political contacts and lobbying experience and Mitchell the organisational expertise, although it was vital that he remained in the background because of his commercial links which could be misconstrued. Mitchell was hon secretary of the Falkland Islands Committee from 1968 to 1972 and subsequently from l972, following the takeover of the Falklands Islands Company, joint hon secretary with Bill Christie. Their campaign was wholly successful.</p><p>Mitchell recognised that there was little alternative to paternalism for the Company's employees and set about improving their lot. The Provident Fund was switched from Company contributions related to dividends to contributions based on profit. The fund which had been wholly invested in gilt-edged securities was reinvested substantially in equities utilising a facility which was available to residents of the colony but not to those of the UK. The change brought about very substantial increases in the value of the fund which exceeded one million pounds prior to his retirement. All employees were given a written form of agreement outlining their rights, notably to pensions which were non-contributory and generous. A prosperity bonus was introduced based on wool prices.</p><p>He was appointed company secretary in 1955 and later London manager before being appointed managing director in 1973. He retired in 1987. He recalls one incident in his career with particular satisfaction. In 1975 the Port of London was brought to a standstill by a strike which occurred when the Company's charter vessel was at Gravesend. Because locking the vessel in port would deprive Islanders of essential supplies he prevailed upon dockworkers to work the vessel, with the normal payments for loading and unloading being made to the dockworkers' committee and donated to charitable causes. The agreement brought about threats from the union involved that if the payments were not made to them future ships of the FIC would be blacked, but nothing ever happened.</p><p>Mitchell married Violet Donaldson on 9 September 1967.</p>",

He entered the Royal Navy as a midshipman, and later transferred to the merchant navy. He became a master mariner, with an impressive war record, having been torpedoed twice in the South Atlantic. He switched to farming in Wales and in 1957 moved to the Falkland Islands, on Pebble Island, and from 1968 at San Carlos, where he had first trained in the 1950s. He was trusted implicitly by the Islanders as a member of the LegCo, where he served from 1959 for more than 20 years. He was awarded an OBE in 1979 and was for several years a vice-president of the Falkland Islands Association, which campaigned for self-determination.</p><p>He became a government employee as agricultural officer and in 1979, he was involved in radical reform of Falklands farming following Lord SHACKLETON's first report, which recommended the subdivision of large farms, previously owned by the Falkland Islands Company or others not living in the Islands, to be sold to Islanders. It was appropriate that the remaining part of his grandfather's enterprise, Roy Cove, was sold for subdivision.</p><p>He was never happier than on horseback tending his vast flock of sheep. But he was always ready to sally forth from his remote farmstead to challenge Argentina in the more formal surroundings of the UN Building in New York and elsewhere.

Monk outlined Islanders' views in what the Governor, Sir Rex <a href=\"/biographies/hunt_sir\">HUNT</a>, called a 'Churchillian' broadcast on Falklands radio on 2 January 1981.

His long experience enabled him to articulate the spirit, attitudes and wishes of the Islanders.

        "body": " <p>stipendiary magistrate, was christened in Wimbledon, Surrey on 25 August 1802 the son of a lawyer and legal reformer, Basil Montagu, and his second wife Laura, née Rush. His mother died when he was young. His father was a friend of many of the Romantic poets and enjoyed a successful career in the law. On 10 November 1817 he was admitted a member of Gray's Inn and on 1 January 1826 was called to the bar. He was appointed attorney general of Van Diemen's Land {Tasmania} on 18 November 1828 and conducted prosecutions with skill and fairness so that his elevation to the bench of the Supreme Court in 1833 was popular. But he lived at the limit of his means, irritated the governor Sir John Franklin and was attacked by the press as the 'mad judge'. He was sued for a debt and when he ruled that a local dog tax was invalid the governor took the opportunity to remove him from office in 1847. Back in England in 1848 he appealed to the Privy Council - unsuccessfully - in a case that became celebrated.</p><p>The Colonial Office were obviously aware of all this and a minute of 1851 noted: 'Mr Montagu was dismissed from a much higher situation in VDL for unjustifiable conduct after a long course of [illegible] and obstructive behaviour towards the local government'. None the less he was appointed stipendiary magistrate for the Falkland Islands on 14 January 1850 and arrived in Stanley with his wife Maria Ann, née Adams and family on the Barque <em>Diana </em>on 2 July. The post of coroner was added to his responsibilities in February 1851. He sided with LAFONE's manager Richard <a href=\"/biographies/williams_richard\">WILLIAMS</a> in a dispute with Governor <a href=\"/biographies/rennie_george\">RENNIE</a> in 1851, to the irritation of the latter and of the Colonial Office. A letter from an Islander to Archbishop Cullen of Dublin noted that the stipendiary magistrate Montagu 'is a Catholic and he is very anxious to have a priest here'.</p><p>In June 1854, he resigned his post leaving his wife running a small school in Stanley, until she returned to England in 1857. In February 1855, Montagu moved to Sierra Leone as registrar of the deeds, becoming acting chief justice in May 1856 and registrar general in 1857. He published a collection of the Ordinances of Sierra Leone in 1857, and later produced similar volumes for the Gold Coast {Ghana} and Lagos. His private life in Freetown was lurid with a creole mistress and at least two illegitimate children. Montagu returned to London in 1880 and died of apoplexy there on 22 June. His wife had died in 1872.</p><p>The <em>Hobart Town Courier </em>published a sympathetic valedictory on the departing Montagu in 1848:</p><blockquote><blockquote>He moved in an eccentric orbit; and if he terrified by those motions, he occasionally delighted us by the brilliant light which he cast around his path. Fresh, vigorous and original, his intellect always commanded respect and not unfrequently admiration.</blockquote></blockquote><p>It was promise that remained unfulfilled.</p>",

        "body": "<p>colonial chaplain was born in 'Baladon BI' (not located, but probably Barbados) in 1816, a younger son of Col Thomas Moody RE and Martha Moody, née Clement. His Christian names reflect his father's admiration for the then commander in the West Indies, Sir James Leith. He entered St Mary's Hall, Oxford, in 1835 to study for the Church and graduated with a BA in 1840 (he later obtained an MA in 1863). He was ordained deacon in 1840 and priest in 1841, both by the Bishop of Lincoln, serving as curate in Radnage, near Oxford. Shortly thereafter he became a naval chaplain.</p><p>His father Colonel Moody's influence at the Colonial Office had secured the post of lieutenant-governor of the Falkland Islands for an elder son, Richard Clement <a href=\"/biographies/moody_richard\">MOODY</a>, in 1841 at the tender age of twenty-eight. And six months after his arrival in the islands, the new lieutenant-governor appealed to London for a colonial surgeon and - so that religion could 'exercise its influence in maintaining good order' - a colonial chaplain. Whether the Moody family had already stitched up the post of chaplain we cannot know, but it was more than three years after his brother wrote to London asking for a chaplain that James Leith Moody arrived in Stanley, having spent the voyage from Río sleeping upon bolts of canvas with five other travellers. He had already spent four years at sea in 1845 in HM frigate <em>Thalia </em>.</p><p>The new chaplain's rather eccentric character is soon reflected in the government archives. Early in 1846 he reproved the magistrate WH <a href=\"/biographies/moore_william\">MOORE</a> for leaving the bodies of two drowned sailors exposed to the elements. In March 1846 he sought the governor's help in preventing the daughter of a settler, McIntosh, from going off to live with a gaucho by the Government Corral at Sparrow Cove - this he said could have a demoralising tendency. In May he appealed for an increase in salary because of the high cost of food, fuel, washing and servants and because he had had to import his furniture from Río. He had already asked London for home leave, within four months of his arrival at Stanley.</p><p>The governor appointed his brother a Justice of the Peace and shortly afterward nominated both James Leith Moody and the magistrate, WH Moore, to the new Legislative and Executive Councils which London had instructed him to form. It was not a happy experiment for either Moody, because the Colonial Office disliked the presence of a minister of religion on the councils, and moreover would not agree that he should be a JP. The chaplain was obliged by his brother to resign these posts and wrote to London in protest. It must have been some consolation that he was granted an increase in salary and permission to take leave, although he did not choose to take this leave. One would expect two brothers, exiled in a small community more than three months sailing from England to be on terms of close friendship. It was not to be. James Leith had no hesitation in protesting to the governor about the failings - real or imagined - of his administration. In January 1847 he wrote to the colonial secretary protesting at the failure of the government to answer letters or keep office hours. He protested to the governor when the Communion table was used as a writing table for the jury, because the same building served as church and courthouse. In November 1847 he denounced the state of the Stanley graveyard and commented acidly: 'I trust Your Excellency, as soon as you have completed your arrangements for your private convenience around Government House, will give your attention to this subject'.</p><p>Equally bitter was a letter to the governor about a bill which Dr <a href=\"/biographies/hamblin_henry\">HAMBLIN</a> had sent the chaplain's servant. James Leith wrote - with heavy sarcasm - that he would have preferred to leave the question until the next governor (George <a href=\"/biographies/rennie_george\">RENNIE)</a> had arrived, given that the doctor's wife had been the governor's housekeeper, that Hamblin's brother-in-law (James <a href=\"/biographies/longden_sir\">LONGDEN)</a> was the Governor's secretary and that the doctor himself was aide-de-camp. But, taking up a theme which was to become commonplace in the next few years, 'as Colonial Chaplain and therefore the natural guardian of the poor' he asked for an opinion. The governor curtly replied that this was a personal matter. Dr Hamblin wrote that the chaplain had displayed extreme ill will, not to say spite.</p><p>During his first few years in the colony, the chaplain had been establishing the Falkland Islands' first school, with only limited support from London. The school opened on 1 January 1846 and 12 children attended. Nine months later eight of these were still attending, but James Leith Moody regretted that the parents of seven other children would not allow them to attend the school, 'from an absurd idea that they would loose caste by allowing their children to attend the same school as those of sappers and working settlers.' He was not happy with the teacher, a youth of 19, and hoped that a respectable married woman would come out from England to teach the girls the use of the needle.</p><p>In January 1847 a new teacher was appointed but William Barry Brown proved less than satisfactory. Although the chaplain defended him, the settlers soon decided that he was effeminate and called him 'Miss Brown the schoolmistress'. When the Government storekeeper called him 'Sally Brown', the chaplain protested and, in the storekeeper's words, 'shook his forefinger in my face very angrily and said - I'll take you in hands on one of these days and surprise you.' However the school master and the chaplain must have fallen out, because on 5 April 1849 Brown wrote to the new governor to inform him that he was resigning as 'the children have been influenced to leave the school by the Revd. JL Moody...'</p><p>In July 1848 the chaplain's brother handed over as governor to George Rennie, an older and more experienced man who had been a Member of Parliament. In April 1849 the bibulous and corrupt magistrate Moore left to be followed by a slightly more judicious figure, Algernon <a href=\"/biographies/montagu_algernon\">MONTAGU</a>. The colony was developing: in October 1849 the military pensioners arrived, thirty of them roughly equally divided between Protestants - mostly Anglicans - and Irish Catholics. The Protestant pensioners were obliged to attend church after their weekly muster on Sunday mornings and it was their view of his sermons which led to a major row between the chaplain and the governor, and a 'trial' of James Leith Moody before successive sessions of LegCo in March and April 1852.</p><p>It is clear that in these years, James Leith Moody's behaviour had become steadily more eccentric, not to say deranged. He had alienated almost all the 'respectable' colonists, and government officials no longer attended his services. His preaching was becoming more paranoid, condemning the drunkenness which was a feature of the young colony but also referring to tyrannical governments in terms which alarmed the commander of the pensioners, Captain Reid, and the senior NCOs, Sergeant-Major <a href=\"/biographies/felton_henry\">FELTON</a> and Sergeant Smith, and caused gossip among all the ex-servicemen.</p><p>On 16 March 1852 Governor Rennie summoned the ExCo, which amounted to the new magistrate Montagu and the colonial surgeon, Dr Hamblin. In ten sessions stretching over a month the Council examined the pensioners, listened to the chaplain's defence and went on to take the views of several of the leading colonists, culminating in a bitter account by John Bull <a href=\"/biographies/whitington_john\">WHITINGTON</a> of Moody's cruel failure to ride to Port Louis to bury his infant son. The sessions are interesting not just for what they reveal of the increasingly contorted mind of Moody, but also for the insights they give us into the daily life of Stanley in the 1850s.</p><p>The Council questioned a good number of pensioners. One was too drunk to reply and several were too canny to become caught up in a dispute between their social superiors. But Captain Reid and Sergeant Smith both recalled that Moody had preached against tyrannical governors and had once implied that the governor himself was guilty of breaking the Sabbath by being absent from Stanley one Sunday. Reid felt uneasy that he compelled the Protestant pensioners to attend Church services where this sort of sermon was preached. So the governor drafted a long letter to Moody, taking up his preaching, but broadening the case against the chaplain with a number of charges:</p><p>The governor added that Moody had an important mission as a chaplain in the Falkland Islands. There were no sectarian animosities - 'the Catholics even accepting your offices at christenings and burials' and the opportunities for healing dissensions and promoting harmony were great. Moody replied with a long letter asserting his loyalty to the Queen and those in authority under her and picking up the specific accusations.</p><p>An entire volume of papers at the PRO is devoted to the case of the Rev Moody. One official minuted: 'I should take him to be a homely and not too cultivated man - he is the brother of the former Governor Capt. Moody, and seems to have been ten years a ship's chaplain, but honestly anxious to do his duty'. As in the case of Mr Moore, 'Governor <a href=\"/biographies/rennie_george\">RENNIE</a> showed very little scruple in getting rid of an officer he (perhaps with good reason) disliked by bringing very paltry charges against him'. The Colonial Office did not sympathise with the governor, did not approve of his proceedings against the chaplain and indeed admired the Rev Moody's fearless admonition against the prevalent vices of the colony.</p><p>In the event, Moody left the colony on leave in 1854 and never returned. He became a chaplain to the forces in 1854 and in 1859 he was assistant chaplain to the forces, Aldershot. Crockford's Clerical Directory states that 'he served at Gibraltar, Malta, China, Crimea, etc.' In Crockford's for 1865 his address was given as Walmer, Kent. He was placed on the retired list in 1876, and became Rector of Virginstow, Launceston, Cornwall, until 1879. He was Vicar of St John the Baptist, Clay Hill, Enfield, from 1879 to 1885, when he retired to Dulwich. From the 1881 Census, we know that he married Mary, who was born around 1833 in Hertfordshire and had three children: William (b c1865), Alicia (b c1869) and Reginald (b c1878). He died in Dulwich in 1896, leaving effects worth over £4,000. His wife Mary died on 28 July 1930 in her ninety ninth year.</p><p>He is remembered by a stamp in the Foundation of Stanley series of 1994, although his portrait by James Peck was necessarily indistinct, as no-one knew what he actually looked like.</p>",

        "body": "<p>governor, was born on 13 February 1813 at St Anne's Garrison in Barbados, the second son of Thomas Moody from Cumberland who had made his career in the Royal Engineers in the West Indies and his wife Martha Clement, the daughter of a wealthy Dutch estate owner.</p><p>Moody was educated privately in England and in 1827 entered the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich and was later appointed head of the Academy. In 1829 he was attached to the Ordnance Survey, he was gazetted second lieutenant in 1830 also in the Royal Engineers and served with the Survey in Ireland in 1832. In 1833 he was posted to St Vincent in the West Indies where he suffered a severe attack of yellow fever, after which he went on convalescence to tour the United States with a Sir Charles Smith, a senior Engineer officer who had acted as governor for several of the West Indian islands.</p><p>He returned to Woolwich in 1838 as assistant professor of Fortifications, until - in his words - as 'merely a subaltern of Engineers, recommended by Lord Vivian, the late Master General of the Ordnance' he was chosen in July 1841 at the age of 28 to become lieutenant governor of the Falkland Islands.</p><p><strong>Appointment to the Falklands</strong></p><p>In fact there seems little doubt that his father, then serving as an adviser in the Colonial Office, obtained the appointment for Moody and ensured that he would be accompanied by a small but vital group of Royal Sappers and Miners. Certainly civil servants seemed dismayed by the size of Moody's party and therefore its probable expense. When Moody was selected no decision had been reached in London on the future of the small British settlement at Port Louis in the Falkland Islands. He was instructed to proceed to the Falkland Islands as lieutenant-governor for 'superintendence and making certain enquiries on the result of which steps will here­after be taken for establishing a regular authority'.</p><p>The secretary of state Lord John Russell stressed the tentative nature of his appointment and informed him that his limited authority should be:</p><blockquote><blockquote>One of influence, persuasion and example, rather than direct authority; but in the exercise of moral rather than legal power, you must of course be guided by your own discretion, rather than by any precise instructions...</blockquote></blockquote><p>He was also told to consult a judicious naval offi­cer to determine the most eligible port for the new colony. In choosing a ship for his expedition, Moody was to earn the enmity of the Whitington family and this feud was to embitter his entire term as governor. GT <a href=\"/biographies/whitington_george\">WHITINGTON</a> a London merchant had adopted a proprie­torial attitude to the new colony and believed that Moody should charter his ship to take the party to the Islands. But his tender was too high and Moody rejected his offer of a corrupt private deal so that relations were soured both with GT Whitington - who pilloried Moody in the <em>Colonial Magazine </em>(of November 1844) - and with his younger brother John Bull <a href=\"/biographies/whitington_john\">WHITINGTON</a> who had emigrated to the Islands in 1840 and was the most sub­stantial figure in the small society of Port Louis.</p><p><strong>Arrival and First Impressions</strong></p><p>Granted a budget of £2000, of which £600 was his own salary, Moody set sail with his party from Woolwich in the brig <em>Hebe  </em>on 9 October 1841. They arrived in Port Louis on 16 January 1842 and Moody addressed the few residents, reassuring them that no great changes were envisaged for the colony, but warning that the paper dollars issued by Louis <a href=\"/biographies/vernet_louis\">VERNET</a> would not be honoured. One month after his arrival Moody sailed on a short cruise around East Falkland, touching once only on West Falkland. He was collecting impressions and opinions for his <em>magnum opus </em>- the General Report upon the Falkland Islands which he completed on 14 April and sent to London on 3 May. For a newcomer with only three months experience of the Islands, Moody's General Report is remarkably comprehensive, out­lining the resources and potential of the Islands, finding both promising and recommending settlement. He drew attention to the likelihood that sheep farming 'would answer well upon a larger scale' and to the potential of tussock grass. The Report has a primitive innocence about it: the prospects were pleasing, everything seemed possible and Moody had yet to face the problems of inadequate immigration and investment and lukewarm support from the Colonial Office. The botanist Joseph Dalton <a href=\"/biographies/hooker_sir\">HOOKER</a> who arrived with the <a href=\"/biographies/ross_sir\">ROSS</a> expedition on 6 April found Moody sympathetic 'Lt Moody seems a very active and intelligent young man, most anxious to improve the colony and gain every information respecting its products' he wrote home. Hooker encouraged Moody to promote tussock and indeed it created a considerable stir in England - the Royal Agricultural Society later awarded Moody their gold medal for encouraging its cultivation.</p><p><strong>Site for the Chief Town: the birth of Stanley</strong></p><p>Moody's instructions had raised the question of the site of the new settlement and mentioned the Admiralty's prefer­ence for Port William as a harbour over Berkeley Sound (where Port Louis was situated). The debate on the virtues of the two harbours lasted for eighteen months, and even the firm decision of the new secretary of state, Lord Stanley, which Moody received on 18 August 1843, did not end the discussion. Captain James Clark Ross the senior naval officer to visit the settlement in Moody's first year argued trenchantly in favour of Port Wil­liam in August 1842 and his advocacy convinced the Governor. Although Moody faithfully reported Ross's views he does not seem to have believed that they would carry the day. Aided by his surveyor Murrell Robinson <a href=\"/biographies/robinson_murrell\">ROBINSON</a>, he pressed on with an elaborate town plan for Port Louis (which he renamed Anson after Admiral Lord <a href=\"/biographies/anson_george\">ANSON</a> who had advocated the colonisation of the Falkland Islands) and allocated holdings of town, suburban and country land.</p><p>When he received Stanley's peremptory command to abandon Port Louis and build a new chief town, Moody naturally obeyed. But he shared the feelings of outrage of all the settlers and wrote a strong - even heated - despatch which drew attention to the colonists' 'disgust' at the change and the need to offer them new allotments in exchange for their investment at Port Louis. The first detachment of Sappers started work on the south shore of Jackson's Harbour in the winter of 1843 and the move of the administration to Stanley - as Moody requested the new seat of government be called - during 1844. The Governor himself finally moved to the new town on 15 July 1844. Moody produced no grand design for the layout of Stan­ley. He had considered four sites before settling on the south shore and he mentioned the long sea front and the ease of unloading cargo along it as a positive advantage.</p><p>Moody himself soon came round to Stanley as chief town and reported optimistically to Whitehall on the improvement to the ground produced by drain­age and grazing and the general contentment of the settlers. He reacted with understandable irritation to a despatch from London recording Commander <a href=\"/biographies/sulivan_sir\">SULIVAN</a>'s scepticism and replied firmly that the decision was now made and accepted.</p><p><strong>Finance </strong></p><p>The colony was to be funded and administered on the same pattern as more established British colonies. Estimates were prepared and accounts submitted. It was soon clear that Moody had not been fully briefed on his responsibilities as 'Accountant' for the colony. His first accounts were improperly submitted and a slow process of distance learning set in hand which was to last for his entire government: just before he left in 1848 he was replying to the auditors' criticisms of his accounts for 1843/4.</p><p>Soon after his arrival Moody was guilty of two financial heresies: he levied a tax (on alcohol - to deter drunkenness) without the approval of any legislative body and he issued promissory notes to make up for the lack of specie in the colony. Both measures were pragmatic responses to serious problems, but this did not soften London's reproof and the issue of personal notes was criticised in Parliament (by Sir William Molesworth).</p><p>Government was the prime economic actor in the colony but the years 1841-8 saw the growth of JM DEAN's business as he rose from a humble agent to JB Whitington to become an auctioneer and storekeeper. In 1847 Samuel LAFONE's cattle hunting enterprise was established at Hope Place and 70 gauchos imported from Uruguay to procure a constant supply of fresh meat for the settlers and passing ships. But Lafone's agent Richard <a href=\"/biographies/williams_richard\">WILLIAMS</a> had difficulty in ensuring a constant supply of fresh beef and relations with Moody (as later with Governor <a href=\"/biographies/rennie_george\">RENNIE)</a> quickly became very strained.</p><p><strong>Land and Settlement</strong></p><p>Moody had recommended in his General Report that immigrants should be brought in from Scotland. But government was not prepared to subsidise emigration to the Falklands and the optimistic tone of the General Report was followed by increasing depression as the flow of immigrants and particularly of 'capitalists', failed to materialise. Government was not prepared to foster settlement and it was difficult for settlers already in the Colony to obtain land from government. The move from Port Louis to Stanley, and the delay in agreeing that land in the old settlement could be swapped for land in the new were further discouragement.</p><p>As the negotiations between the Lafone family and the Colonial Office progressed, Moody urged that the sums received from Lafone should be used to establish smaller farms in the Islands, but Whitehall - having spent considerable sums in establishing the Colony, wished to pocket most of Lafone's payments. It was in any case difficult to allot land when the Camp had not been surveyed and when any method of demarcating plots was bound to be laborious. However on 2 July 1847, Moody introduced a temporary system whereby tracts of land could be leased and this aroused some interest among settlers and, perhaps surprisingly, was not criticised by Whitehall.</p><p><strong>Administration</strong></p><p>Moody's initial position as lieutenant-governor was reinforced in June 1843 when the Colonial Office promoted him to governor and commander-in-chief and instructed him to establish a normal colonial administration with Legislative and Executive Councils.</p><p>In a despatch of 19 July 1842, Moody had already requested assistance in the shape of a court of judicature, a doctor and a clergyman to care for the physical and moral health of the colon­ists. The Colonial Office responded reasonably promptly and Dr Henry James <a href=\"/biographies/hamblin_henry\">HAMBLIN</a> arrived in January 1844 while the Reverend John Leith <a href=\"/biographies/moody_james\">MOODY</a> (the governor's brother) landed in October 1845.</p><p>Administratively more significant was the appearance of the stipendiary magistrate William Henry <a href=\"/biographies/moore_william\">MOORE</a> in March 1845 and of the governor's private secretary JH <a href=\"/biographies/slaughter_john\">SLAUGHTER</a> in January 1844. The colonial surgeon Hamblin had brought with him his wife and her mother and brother JR <a href=\"/biographies/longden_sir\">LONGDEN</a> - the last was to prove an able clerk and was to move on to a distinguished career in the Colonial Service.</p><p>ExCo and LegCo first met in October and November 1845 respectively. They were drawn from the small group of 'respectable' officers about the Governor: Moore, Hamblin and the Rev Moody. The settler Whitington who should - socially - have been eligible was ruled out by his feud with Moody, but Ri­chard Williams - Lafone's agent - was later to join Council. The Secretary of State was not happy with a clergyman on either Council and Moody agreed to remove his brother - only to find that the latter took bitter offence.</p><p>It would be pleasant to report that reinforcement made the governor's life easier. But the new officials introduced new points of friction. Moody had already dismissed his private secretary and chief surveyor Murrell Robinson Robinson after a furious row in March 1845. He soon found that the stipendiary magistrate Moore was a self-important shyster with a weakness for drink. And the colonial chaplain, his brother James Leith Moody, turned out to be querulous and eccentric. Slaughter - the new private secretary - was 'of a morbid disposition' and soon asked to go home.</p><p>The last three years of Moody's governorship were marked by long and bitter exchanges of correspondence with those who should have been his supporters and allies. Moody tried without success to persuade London to remove Moore. With James Leith Moody relations were poor, but less openly hostile. While Moore and the Rev Moody were the governor's chief adversaries in the paper battles which fill the archives, there were others with whom he exchanged bitter reproaches. Commander Sulivan, the Captain of HM survey vessel <em>Philomel </em>, who should have been a natural ally, crossed Moody in April 1845 when his officers provided hospitality to Murrell Robinson Robinson during the lat­ter's dispute with Moody. The storekeeper Edmonds engaged in a correspondence of extraordinary impertinence with the Governor in 1847-8: so much so that Moody was less outraged than concerned at his subordinate's inability to perceive his place in the hierarchy.</p><p><strong>Moody as Governor</strong></p><p>So many of the problems of Moody's term in the Islands seem directly attributable to his personality. Querulous he undoubtedly was - partly perhaps a family failing, but also because he felt insecure. As a mere lieutenant when he was dispatched to the Islands, he was diffident and morbidly sensitive to slights - real or imagined - from senior visiting naval officers.</p><p>Unfortunately almost no private letters from Moody survive from his term in the Islands. In personal terms the most revealing de­spatch is his long account of his relations with Murrell Robinson Robinson in which Moody explains that he had chosen to remain aloof from the colonists. He seems to have shunned personal confrontations: his dispute with John Bull Whitington in 1844 concludes with a refusal to grant a personal interview because it was 'unbecoming my station to take any further notice of this individual'.</p><p>The history of the latter half of Moody's governorship can almost be divided into chapters covering his successive disputes with his subordinates: Robinson in 1845; WH Moore in 1846 and 1847; the Rev JL Moody in 1847 and 1848; Edmonds the clerk in 1847; and Richard Williams, Lafone's agent, in 1847 and 1848. These can be charted in wearying detail through a succession of letters and notes, sometimes revealing major differences of principle but often simply petty. A stronger character would have cut these tangles with personal interviews, but Moody preferred to engage in salvos of correspondence. In fairness, his subordinates were often difficult and some slightly deranged.</p><p>Moody served almost seven years away from home in a severe environment and in a tiny community. For much of the time he was in temporary quarters or boarding with Dr Hamblin and his family. Although he designed Government House in Stanley, only the east wing was completed during his tour. During his first two years he showed energy and curiosity in promoting his new domain. He proposed exporting dried meat and fish to the mainland and compressing peat to power steamships and he produced a detailed proposal for establishing a penal colony on the Islands. His salary was increased from £600 a year to £800 in 1845. But his enthusiasm was gradually eroded by feuds with his subordinates, disputes with settlers and disagreements with visiting naval officers. When his father was posted from the Colonial Office to Guernsey and when Lord Grey assumed the mantle of Secretary of State in June 1846, Moody found the Colonial Office less understanding, colder and reproachful.</p><p><strong>Moody's Achievement</strong></p><p>As the first governor, Moody deserves credit for establishing a regular administration in the Falkland Islands. The archives, which effectively date from his arrival, show that within the limits of his resources order was imposed on an unruly settle­ment, land was surveyed, letters answered, and some law imposed on the fractious ships' captains, traders, whalers and wreckers who made up the sea-faring community. The two Councils - Executive and Legislative - were established, as were Courts of Law - however unsatisfactory the magistrate. The new capital of Stan­ley was laid out and a nucleus of dwellings, storehouses, jetties and corrals built on a barren shore. A school, a church, a cemetery, a gaol, a militia, a police force were established. Lafone's project was launched, however uncertainly, and was to develop into the largest enterprise in the Islands - the Falkland Islands Company.</p><p>Less impressive was the slow progress made in settling the new colony. Far from the race of thrifty 'capitalists' Moody looked for, the settlers who arrived tended to be sailors who had jumped ship or been shipwrecked, or British refugees from the upheavals around the River Plate. Moody was scathing about:</p><blockquote><blockquote>...our community ... chiefly composed of men of the lowest class, formerly seamen in whale ships &amp; sealers, foreigners and Spanish gauchos...the only persons opposed to such wretched material for the formation of a colony are the 5 or 6 gentlemen and the detachment of Royal Sappers and Miners.</blockquote></blockquote><p>The 1840s were a time of distress in Britain and famine in Ireland and Moody can scarcely be reproached for sharing the prejudices and fears of a gentleman of his time. As an officer and as governor he was concerned for the welfare of those in his charge, but he could not help wishing that they were more thrifty, more reliable and more sober.</p><p>If Moody's greatest failing was his inability to lead his senior government officers it may be doubted whether - even with a more loyal and effective team - he could have achieved much more. Until the Colonial Office was prepared to set out clear guide­lines for settlers it would be difficult to persuade immigrants to invest in land. And the colony was too new and too little known to attract the maritime traffic which was to provide a living for Stanley in the l850s and l860s. It took the Californian gold rush of 1849 to bring the haven offered by the Islands to the notice of the shipping trade.</p><p><strong>Back in England</strong></p><p>Moody left Stanley on HM transport <em>Nautilus </em>in July 1848 reaching England in February 1849; he was entitled to a year's leave. He was promoted first captain in August and attached to the Colonial Office where he advised on the arrangements for sending the military pensioners to Stanley. After a brief posting in Plymouth he was appointed Commanding Royal Engineers in Newcastle. It was here that in July 1852 he met and married Mary Susanna, the daughter of Joseph Hawks, a JP and deputy lieutenant. They were to have eleven children. Moody was posted to Malta in 1854, but obliged to return through ill health. Promoted lieutenant-colonel, he was appointed Commander, Royal Engineers, Scotland. He enjoyed the intellectual company of the Scots capital and pursued his interest in architecture, drawing up plans for the restoration of Edinburgh Castle, which he was asked to present to Queen Victoria, but which were never implemented.</p><p><strong>British Columbia</strong></p><p>In 1858 Moody was promoted to brevet colonel and appointed lieutenant-governor and chief commissioner for lands and works in the colony of British Columbia. Accompanied by his wife and four children he left England in October and arrived in Victoria on Christmas Day. The colony was under pressure from the United States and a gold rush was bringing large numbers of prospectors across the border. Moody had a detachment of 172 Royal Engineers under his command to defend the colony and provide survey and road building support. Shortly after his arrival Moody faced down a notorious outlaw Ned McGowan and fractious gold miners without loss of life. He then selected a site for the new capital of the colony and named it New Westminster. Much of his time and that of the detachment of sappers was spent in clearing the site and opening roads around it. Unfortunately Moody failed to get on with the governor of the colony, James Douglas, who knew his parish well and was not overly impressed by either Moody or the sappers. In 1863 Moody and the detachment were recalled and he returned with his family (now of seven children) and those sappers who did not wish to settle in British Columbia. Moody left his library behind to become the public library of New Westminster. It is reported that he also left his native American housekeeper with two children.</p><p><strong>Last Years</strong></p><p>Moody was put in command at Chatham in 1864 and retired from the army in 1866 with the rank of major-general. He had decided that he could no longer impose the rigours of a military career on his large family. He lived quietly in Lyme Regis, Dorset and died of a stroke on 31 May 1887 while visiting Bournemouth with his daughter. He left over £24,000, a considerable sum for the time. Moody was a member of various learned and professional societies - the Royal Agricultural, the Royal Geographical and the Institute of Civil Engineers. Just before his death he was elected an honorary associate of the Royal Institute of British Architects. Several photographs of Moody (and one of his wife) were taken in Canada and a family sketch of him as a young officer is above. He is remembered by Moody Brook near Stanley and by several place names near Vancouver - Port Moody and Moody's Inlet. He featured in the Anniversary of Stanley series of Falkland Islands stamps released in 1994.</p>",

        "body": "<p>botanist, was born in Barnard Castle, Co Durham on 26 July, 1933, eldest son of Moresby George Moore and his wife Elizabeth Moore, née Grange. On leaving Barnard Castle School he studied at University College, University of Durham, where he was awarded a BSc (1954), PhD (1957) and DSc (1984). In 1957 he married Ida Elizabeth Shaw: they had two children: Wayne Peter (b1961) and Lloyd Randal (b1969). In 1958, he served as Research Officer in the Genetics Section, CSIRO, Canberra and went with ANARE to Macquarie Island. From 1959 to 1961 he was Research Botanist at UCLA, in the United States. During an expedition to Chile (October 1960 — February 1961) he spent time in Tierra del Fuego and because of his circum-Antarctic botanical interests, this led inevitably to the Falkland Islands</p><p>On 5 January 1964 he reached Stanley on board the <em>Kista Dan </em>in the company of Sir Vivian <a href=\"/biographies/fuchs_sir\">FUCHS</a>, director of the British Antarctic Survey. There he was met by Ian and Irene Strange, his hosts for the next 10 days when he made extensive plant collections in the area, as well as dining with Governor <a href=\"/biographies/arrowsmith_sir\">ARROWSMITH</a>, and giving radio interviews. On 15 January he flew to Darwin, staying with Mike and Vicki Mussons at the school near Fish Creek. From this base he collected on and around Mount Usborne and into northern Lafonia and dined with the legendary Tom GILRUTH.</p><p>From Darwin he went to San Carlos where, from 23-27 January, he was looked after by Chris and Marguerite Bonner and collected widely in the area. He then flew to Port Stephens and Mike and Margaret Shaw enabled his access to the botanically fascinating south west part of West Falkland. Walking over much of the camp, he bivouacked at the Cape Meredith Shanty (accompanied by a host of mice and rats) and stayed with the Hansens at Hoste Inlet. Ten Shilling Bay peninsula proved a botanical treasure trove; <em>Nastanthus falklandicus </em>, belonging to the Calyceraceae, a plant family formerly only known from the Andes, and <em>Plantago moorei </em>, with its closest relatives in Tasmania, grew with high mountain plants not seen near sea level in the last century and a half.</p><p>On to Hill Cove, where Bill <a href=\"/biographies/blake_william\">BLAKE</a> facilitated his work on and around Mount Adam. Then, on 17 February, Moore flew to Westpoint Island to stay with Roddy and Lilly Napier and learn much about the endemic <em>Calandrinia feltonii </em>, which grew in their garden but was apparently extinct elsewhere. After four days, he returned to Stanley, leaving aboard <em>Darwin  </em>on 2 March.</p><p>Arriving in Montevideo on 6 March he flew to southern Argentina and Chile, which were to be the focus of his work in Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego for very many years thereafter, before returning to England on 5 April 1964. Moore was a lecturer at the University of Leicester from 1961-1968 and then moved to the University of Reading, where he became Reader in Plant Taxonomy and then (from 1976 -1994) Professor of Botany. He is now Professor emeritus and the author of 22 books (including <em>The Vascular Flora of the Falkland Islands </em>, BAS 1968) and over 90 scientific papers. He is commemorated by the plant-name <em>Plantago moorei </em>, and by two hills in Tierra del Fuego - Monte Moore and Cerro Moore.</p>",

        "body": "<p>governor and explorer, was born in Brompton, Chatham, Kent, probably in 1820. He entered the Royal Navy as a volunteer of the first class on 19 October 1833 and as a career naval officer spent twelve years as mate of the  <em>Terror  </em>(Captain FRM <a href=\"/biographies/crozier_francis\">CROZIER)</a> during the expedition of Captain James Clark <a href=\"/biographies/ross_sir\">ROSS</a>. Subsequently he was skipper of the hired 362 ton barque  <em>Pagoda </em>, surveying the Antarctic from Bouvet Island to Enderby Land and Queen Mary Land. Finally in 1847, he commanded HMS  <em>Plover  </em>in a five year search for the disastrous Franklin expedition lost in the North West Passage. Moore called at Stanley in May 1848 on his way round the Horn to Alaska and directed several peremptory requests for assistance to Governor <a href=\"/biographies/moody_richard\">MOODY</a>. While in the Arctic, Moore had been promoted commander and soon after his return in 1852 he was promoted captain as a reward for his efforts. He was elected Fellow of the Royal Society on 1 June 1854 for his 'skill and sense in making magnetic observations at sea'.</p><p>Being at the bottom of the captains' list with no further prospect of further commands at sea, he accepted the governorship of the Falkland Islands. He was asked to pay £80 for his commission and he refused. He asked for a private secretary, but that was denied him. His half-pay lapsed and he was given a salary of £800-£900 yearly.</p><p>Sailing from Plymouth on 12 August 1855, Moore arrived in the Falkland Islands as governor with his pregnant wife Emma (née Tapling) and their daughter on 7 November on board the 360-ton barque  <em>Frowning Beauty </em>(Captain Harrison). Accompanying him was Commander John Sibbald RN, an old friend since the Antarctic voyages with Ross, and the first lighthouse keeper, Mr Creed and his family.</p><p>Although he was one of the very few governors to have seen the Falkland Islands before his appointment, it is clear that initially he found things difficult and had trouble settling down. He wrote home to England: 'When I first came here everything looked deplorable, drunkenness was the prevailing habit' and he described the settlers as worse than savages. He was obviously missing the quarterdeck as he wrote that the colony's officers' 'ideas are to live in a kind of degraded state'. He suspended (though only temporarily) Arthur <a href=\"/biographies/bailey_arthur\">BAILEY</a>, the colony surveyor and a magistrate, for discharging a pistol in the settlement and for insulting conduct in walking away when Moore was speaking to him. In 1856, he wrote a long despatch asking that all his senior officers be removed from the colony and replaced. He had quarrelled with the colonial secretary James <a href=\"/biographies/longden_sir\">LONGDEN</a>, William Rennie (Governor <a href=\"/biographies/rennie_george\">RENNIE</a>'s son, who had remained behind after his father's departure), Bailey and Captain <a href=\"/biographies/packe_robert1\">PACKE</a>. The Colonial Office minuted: 'I am afraid the Governor is scarcely fit for his post. In the Falklands all has gone so ill that bad humour and quarrels are almost to be forgiven as the all but inevitable result of the painful circumstances under which the officials are placed'. To add to the problems, in his first year the colony suffered its first epidemic: fourteen children died and the school was closed for seventeen weeks.</p><p>But matters improved: <em> </em>the following January the governor wrote that he was satisfied with William Rennie and that Packe was back as a JP: 'The harmony which at present exists between myself and the officers of the government will remain unbroken'.</p><p>With the Crimean War over, visits by shipping voyaging round Cape Horn increased steadily and with Cape Pembroke lighthouse in action, Stanley was now considered a harbour of refuge. By February 1862, Moore was able to report in the annual Blue Book for the previous year:</p><blockquote><blockquote>The tables of shipping will show a gradual but decided increase in the number of vessels which have availed themselves of the great advantages of this port for obtaining fresh meat, vegetables, water and provisions of all kinds and, where damaged, can be repaired at less cost than at any other port on this coast of America. The aggregate tonnage of shipping entered at this port during the past year amounted to 21,327 tons being an increase over the preceding year of 5,285 tons.</blockquote></blockquote><p>Governor <a href=\"/biographies/rennie_george\">RENNIE</a> had been the first person in the Falkland Islands to domesticate one of the wild cows from the large herds, which roamed the Islands. The idea took hold and, following its success rather than wholesale slaughter, it became policy under Governor Moore to capture and reclaim the wild cattle forming them into tame herds, the cows for their milk and the large number of surplus bulls for meat. A dispute arose, however, over the ownership of the wild cattle and who might be permitted to kill them. While the Falkland Islands Company, by nature of their Charter, had exclusive right to hunt and kill cattle in Lafonia, they were subject to the Ordinances of 1851 and 1853 on their leased land, which forbade any person to kill wild cattle without the governor's permission. However the herds moved around the camp, regardless of farm boundaries and the law was hard to police. The Company maintained their right to kill wild cattle on their leased land and indeed admitted being at fault in sending gauchos to kill cattle for commercial reasons ten miles away from their leased land. A prosecution against the Company in the Islands followed by appeals in England rumbled on for years, far beyond Moore's time as Governor.</p><p>Meanwhile it became apparent that the Falkland Islands were entirely suitable for sheep farming and it was now increasingly taking over as the main agricultural occupation. By 1858 there were nearly 8,000 sheep, mostly Cheviot and Southdown breeds. Carcasses were being sold in Stanley and wool sent home 'commanding a very remunerative price in the London market'. But with each Falkland sheep valued at about £2, it was difficult to establish a sheep farm without considerable capital for the first purchase of sheep. Ewes could be obtained from the South American coast at 12s to 14s each, but many of these perished at sea and they needed to be crossed with English breeds to produce a profitable flock.</p><p>Early in 1857, Moore, using the naval brig  <em>Siren </em>, managed to visit Keppel Island accompanied by Wiliam Rennie as acting colonial secretary from 1856-57. Moore was clearly impressed with what Keppel offered in terms of agriculture and with the progress of the Patagonian Mission under its newly arrived superintendent, GP <a href=\"/biographies/despard_george\">DESPARD</a>. The lease provided a valuable income to the colony for 1856, besides promising important future income from the settlement of West Falkland over the next decades. After Keppel, the  <em>Siren </em>sailed on to Pebble Sound and the party went ashore on West Falkland by the Warrah River where they camped. In 1861, JM DEAN's proposal to settle Pebble Island together with a few other adjacent islands for sheep and cattle farming met with prompt support from Governor Moore, who suggested that he should stock the islands with cattle from West Falkland. Initially Dean was given a lease at £20 a year and subsequently permitted to buy the islands for £400.</p><p>In 1858 an agreement reached with the postmaster general in London reduced the postage rate to 6d per half ounce for mail either way between the colony and England, in line with other colonies but, in the case of the Falklands, this was still always to be paid in England on receipt or posting. Moore also welcomed book postage since: 'A Book Club and a Reading Room, on temperance principles, already exist and the latter has done much good among the Colonists. The maintenance of these useful societies would be ensured by the facility of obtaining books regularly by the mail from England'. Arrangements for prepaid postage were introduced in the Falkland Islands on 1 August 1861 and James Longden was appointed postmaster.</p><p>Governor Moore was the first governor to reside at Government House, begun in 1844 but still in the process of being built; the wooden cottage previously used now became the Government Office. The Births Register records that the Moores had a second daughter, Lydia Edith, born in the Islands on 8 February 1856. But on a less happy note, the Deaths Register shows that Emma Jane Moore died on 10 April 1859 aged 43 from  <em>angina pectoris </em>. She has the sad distinction of being the only Governor's wife to be buried in Stanley cemetery. Moore wrote home that she had a short but painful illness. Clearing up her papers in January 1860, Moore was shocked to find affectionate letters from the magistrate Thomas <a href=\"/biographies/brooke_thomas\">BROOKE</a>. The magistrate was taxed by Moore with this betrayal and - while he was home on leave in 1860 - by the Colonial Office. Brooke wrote a long letter, excusing himself, not denying the offence, but painting a picture of a boorish, suspicious and dishonourable governor.</p><p>In 1856 Moore moved the church into the east half of the building that Governor Rennie had built as an exchange and made the west wing into the school; in 1862 the church was named Holy Trinity. A new colonial chaplain arrived on 29 December 1859 in the person of the Reverend Charles <a href=\"/biographies/bull_charles\">BULL</a> who became inspector of schools and also one of the four members of ExCo.</p><p>Governor Moore completed his tour as governor of the Falkland Islands in 1862. It seems probable that he left the Islands on HMS  <em>Satellite </em>on 24 November. He returned to half-pay until being put on the retired list in 1866 and promoted rear admiral on the retired list in 1867. The last five years of his life were spent at 5, Victoria Place, East Stonehouse, Plymouth. In the middle of 1871 he suffered a stroke and he died on 30 April 1872 from congestion of the lungs. He was buried in the family vault at St George's Church, Stonehouse. He was survived by his second wife, three daughters and a son.</p>",

        "body": " <p>stipendiary magistrate, was the second son of William John Moore, a Dublin attorney, and Charlotte Augusta, née Purdon. He was educated at Hazelwood, Warwickshire and was admitted as a student of over 16 years to King's Inns, Dublin, in the Michaelmas term of 1826. Moore was married and working as a solicitor in Belturbet, Co Cavan in the 1840s. He applied for the post of magistrate in the infant colony of the Falkland Islands, armed with a testimonial signed by many of the Dublin legal establishment. Appointed on a salary of £400 a year, Moore left his practice (and his wife) and arrived in Port Louis on 6 March 1845 on the brig <em>Hebe </em>, bringing with him the makings of a timber house. Moore got off to a bad start by informing Governor <a href=\"/biographies/moody_richard\">MOODY</a> that he had promised the secretary of state before leaving England 'that he would do what he could' for the Governor.</p><p>Relations between the two reached breaking point in May 1846 when Moody instructed Moore to charter the schooner <em>Despatch </em>and seek out three men who had stolen a boat from one of the colonists. Moore was reluctant to set out and showed no enthusiasm for the pursuit, returning empty handed to Stanley and complaining about the harsh conditions on board. A further dispute followed over the ownership of a brig, <em>Alonzo </em>, where Moore acted as agent for her captain, Bowers, improperly in Moody's view. Their mutual accusations occupy many pages of the archives, with each commenting at length on the complaints of the other, and appealing to the Secretary of State in London. Moody reported on 25 June 1846: 'there are many Irishmen here, Mr Moore is an Irishman, and the observation has been made that we have a \"Daniell O'Connell\" among us.' He noted scathingly that Moore 'on the slightest occasions (when no-one else is anxious)' walked about 'with pistols displayed in a broad leather belt'.</p><p>Moore was a caricature provincial lawyer: argumentative, self important, on the make and a heavy drinker. When he inspired a petition in his defence the more respectable colonists declined to sign it and the less deferential lampooned it, to Moore's indignation. The Colonial Office declined to discipline Moore but his relations with the next governor, <a href=\"/biographies/rennie_george\">RENNIE</a>, were no better. Although his drunkenness was less outrageous, perhaps because his wife Elisabeth had joined him in 1848, his official conduct was still unsatisfactory. Eventually he was suspended in April 1849 and returned to London where the Colonial Office were relatively sympathetic and spoke of a post in some other colony. But, in a remarkable own goal, Moore was discovered offering legal advice to a company in dispute with the Colonial Office. He was sacked, despite the pleas of his local baronet, (Sir James Young of Bailieborough, Co Cavan) supported by seven Irish MPs, and disappears from view in a minor post (salary £100 per year) in the Customs in London. In August 1883, <em>The Times </em>noted the marriage of Edwin, youngest son of WH Moore of Denmark Hill, south London.</p>",

        "body": "<p>Argentine diplomat, was born on 31 January 1782. Like his elder brother, Mariano, he was educated at the Real Colegio de San Carlos, and is said to have commanded a unit resisting the British invasions of Buenos Aires in 1806 and 1807. When Mariano Moreno became secretary to the Primera Junta, the governing council which succeeded Spanish colonial rule following the Revolution of 25 May 1810, Manuel became his assistant. In 1811 Manuel Moreno accompanied his brother, who had been sent to London. However, Mariano died during the voyage, showing all the symptoms of poisoning, and was buried at sea. He may well have been a victim of his political enemies. Manuel Moreno went on to Britain, and lived there for two years, writing a book about his late brother. He then returned to Buenos Aires, only to fall foul of the powers that be and to leave as an exile for the United States. There he studied medicine at the University of Maryland in Baltimore.</p><p>Moreno returned to Argentina in 1821. He never practised medicine, but became a leading scientist. He also continued to write and was made director of the National Library a year later. However his most important activities were political. He became a deputy and a government minister and, under the premiership of Manuel Dorrego, was minister of foreign relations. This led on to his appointment in London as chargé d'affaires in 1829. Three years later, he was promoted to minister plenipotentiary in London.  He was therefore spokesman for President Juan Manuel de <a href=\"/biographies/rosas_juan\">ROSAS</a> during his long period in control of Buenos Aires and the young Argentine Confederation.</p><p>So it fell to Moreno to protest against the return of the British to the Falklands in 1833. On 17 June 1833, he submitted a protest, backed by a detailed historical argument, which was later published in instalments in the <em>British Packet and Argentine News </em>. This was intended to prove Spanish rights to the Falklands, and to claim that Argentina had inherited these on gaining its independence. Like Louis <a href=\"/biographies/vernet_louis\">VERNET</a>'s similar historical arguments, deployed against Francis Baylies, the American chargé d'affaires in 1832, following the Lexington Raid, it was probably written with the help of Pedro de Angelis, a Neapolitan who had emigrated to Argentina, and became known as the 'father' of Argentine historians. In particular, Moreno's protest of June 1833 concentrated on the argument that there had been a secret promise on the part of the British to evacuate Port Egmont shortly after its return to Britain in 1771. This led King William IV to order an investigation in British archives, and much of the correspondence from 1771 was submitted to Moreno by the foreign secretary Lord Palmerston on 8 January 1834 to disprove his thesis. Moreno was not satisfied.</p><p>In 1842, Moreno tried to raise the matter of the Falklands again after Lord Aberdeen had taken over as foreign secretary from Palmerston. In a similar exchange with Aberdeen, Moreno appeared very grudgingly to accept that there had been no such secret promise.</p><p>Later it fell to Moreno to discreetly sound out Britain on Rosas's idea of exchanging Argentina's claim to the Falklands for annulment of its debt to London bankers Barings, contracted by Bernadino Rivadavia in the 1820s, and in default. In November 1838, Rosas instructed Moreno to: \"insist on the claim whenever there is an opportunity... but at the same time explore wisely, without it being apparent that it is an idea of this government, if there were a disposition on the part of the British Government to do a financial transaction that would be to cancel the debt...\". Later, in 1842, when Barings sent an envoy, Franck de Pallacieu Falconet, to Buenos Aires to try to restart payments on the loan, Minister of the Economy Manuel Insiarte tried to get him to pursue this idea with the British Government. At the same time, Moreno, in London, was again instructed to pursue the idea. It is not clear quite what enquiries Moreno made to the British Government. But Moreno reported that the main problem was that Britain simply did not accept the Argentine sovereignty claim; also Moreno thought such an arrangement would have to go before Parliament, where he probably harboured fears that it would be considered a private business matter and nothing to do with the British government. The outstanding principal and interest was about one million, nine hundred thousand pounds by then too, and Moreno doubted whether Argentina's claim to the Falklands could be considered to be worth all that. Whatever the reasons were, Foreign Secretary Lord Aberdeen turned the proposal down, and Argentina had to give up the idea. As a result, Argentina re-started its payments on the Baring loan on 1 May 1844, although these were suspended again in October that year because of the blockade of the River Plate which marked the beginning of the Anglo-French intervention there. They were then not restarted until the 1849 Treaty (below) had re-established peace again.</p><p>Moreno wrote again to Palmerston in July 1849 to protest against a reported remark in parliament that Argentina had acquiesced in Britain's recovery of the Falkland Islands and to reassert his country's claim<em>. </em>Palmerston replied emolliently, although his cryptic wording is still misconstrued in Argentina today. Unlike Moreno, who had been kept in the dark by Rosas, Palmerston knew that an all-embracing peace agreement with Argentina was under negotiation in Buenos Aires at that time to end the Anglo-French intervention in the River Plate.</p><p>While not mentioning the Falklands directly, this treaty would effectively accept Britain's possession of the Islands. It was signed that November, and ratified the following year. In the aftermath of the 1849 treaty, Argentina fell silent about the Falklands for 35 years, until President <a href=\"/biographies/roca_julio\">ROCA</a> revived the claim in 1884 with the so-called 'Affair of the Map'.</p><p>Rosas fell from power in 1852, and went into exile in Britain. So Moreno was recalled to Argentina. He then lived in Buenos Aires in comparative obscurity, taking no further part in politics, and died on 28 December 1857.</p>",

As a consequence, he made several voyages to Patagonia accompanying Luis <a href=\"/biographies/piedra_buena\">PIEDRA BUENA</a>. With Francisco P Moreno he went on an important expedition which discovered the source of the river Santa Cruz among other topographical features in the zone. When, in 1884, the region south of Buenos Aires Province was declared by the Argentine Government to be 'National Territories' and duly subdivided into the various provinces, he was appointed the first governor of Santa Cruz.</p><p>Moyano's connection with the Falkland Islands came with a visit he made there in 1885. The Argentine Government had requested him to approach the Islanders, offering them the possibility of renting large tracts of land on the mainland to extend their farming activities. The aim was to increase the population of Patagonia with more Europeans at a time when people living further north in Argentina were reluctant to settle in the south. Argentine relations with Chile were unfriendly at this time, so the solution was to approach the people of the Islands to see if they were interested in the project.</p><p>Moyano travelled to the Islands in January 1885 on the mail steamer from Punta Arenas and left on 11 March. Apart from buying 600 sheep, he managed to convince 15 shepherds formerly from Scotland, some 80 people with their families, to undertake the move to the Patagonian mainland. They included : William Dickie, William Douglas, Herbert Felton, William Halliday, John Hamilton, William McCall, George McGeorge, John Edward Rudd, and John Scott and their families, who all settled successfully. Governor <a href=\"/biographies/kerr_thomas\">KERR</a> reported Moyano's visit to London and, referring to a report from the British Minister in Buenos Aires that the Argentine government proposed to revive its claim to the Islands, added: 'I am of the opinion that his visit was undertaken on his own responsibility and solely for the purpose which he intimated,' ie, that there was no ulterior motive.</p><p>Moyano's visit also had a romantic outcome. As Sundays in Stanley were without things to do, he spent his time sauntering around the town. On passing the cathedral, he saw, among those leaving after a service, the young Edith Turner with her uncle James J. <a href=\"/biographies/felton_george\">FELTON</a>. It was love at first sight and her family accepted his proposal that they should marry, the only condition being that Edith should wait until 1886 when she reached 18 years old. Then, Moyano sent the <em>Villarino </em>for her and they were married in Santa Cruz on 12 September with all pomp and ceremony. They received wedding gifts from the Patagonian Indians of ponchos and other typical items and left for their honeymoon in Buenos Aires. Afterwards they returned to Patagonia where Moyano continued to serve as provincial governor until he retired in 1905 and went to live in Buenos Aires, where he died on 7 October 1910. Ethel died in Buenos Aires in 1918. They had a son and a daughter, María Clarisa.</p><p>There is now a splendid monument to Moyano's memory in Santa Cruz.</p>",

He began employment with the Department of Agriculture in New Zealand in April 1897 and worked in both the Wellington and Auckland areas, gradually rising through the ranks of the department until 1924 when he was appointed principal inspector of stock in Auckland. He was a highly experienced government officer by the time he was sent to the Falkland Islands at the request of Governor MIDDLETON.</p><p>He soon developed a close working relationship with the Governor, who was very gloomy about the state of the main industry of the Islands as were a number of leading farmers. Munro's Report, published at the end of 1924, was the first truly systematic examination of the condition of the natural resources of the Falklands, and how they might be more effectively managed and exploited. To accompany it, Governor Middleton wrote a long and comprehensive memorandum on the sheep farming industry. Munro never challenged the assumptions of his time underlying the open ranching style of monocultural sheep farming. But he sought to improve farming efficiency, and make the natural environment serve a better-managed sheep farming industry. His report began by stressing the importance of indigenous plants and noted that 'great diversity of opinion still exists on essential points in connection with pasture management among capable men who are in charge of various stations.'</p><p>The report noted damage caused by over stocking and the uncontrolled burning of grass: 'The process of decay has been so gradual, and spread over such a long period, that serious concern has only arisen in recent years.' Munro believed that overstocking reduced the overall carrying capacity of the land. As regards Tussac Grass, his words are stark: this 'can probably be classed as one of the most nutritious grasses in the world' so it was 'quite remarkable to see it so much neglected in a country where nutritious vegetation of any kind is all too scarce'.</p><p>Munro asserted that the Islands had been overstocked for at least thirty years prior to his arrival. While some land had been well managed, unfortunately the best land had suffered the greatest damage from burning and overstocking. The Report clearly outlines the damage caused by burning and Munro concluded: 'There are no doubt occasions when coarse vegetation on wet camp reaches a stage when burning is justified; but it should be confined to wet camp and resorted to even there only when considered essential and under the most favourable conditions'.</p><p>Munro stated that the most effective method of improving the situation was a threefold combination of greater subdivision of the land, reduction of the number of stock carried and a greatly restricted grass-burning regime. Greater subdivision of paddocks would allow a better rotational system of grazing. Munro suggested that the use of lime and clovers would increase the quality of animal fodder.</p><p>With regard to the use of cattle in land management Munro advised that:</p><blockquote><blockquote>It would be very beneficial to pastures to carry many more cattle than is done at present, more particularly on properties which are subdivided into areas which will enable them to be used to the best advantage as scavengers to clean up the coarse vegetation as well as for the purpose of consolidating the surface soil.</blockquote></blockquote><p>The reasons for high level of mortality of young sheep were outlined; Munro contended that the main reason was the exhaustion of the pastures, and the poor nutritional value of the remaining vegetation. Natural deficiencies in the soil can be compensated by the provision of rock-salt blocks called 'sheep licks.' Munro criticised rough handling of the sheep by some shepherds, and the failure of some farms to reduce sheep mortality by bridging creeks and ditches. He was scathing about the sheep breeding he observed during his travels in the Islands, and he urged investigation into the value of several breeds of sheep - especially the Corriedale, Merino and Romney. He warned against the danger of indiscriminate inbreeding.</p><p>Munro made detailed comments on the quality of wool that the Islands produced. On the quality of farm maintenance, Munro remarked:</p><blockquote><blockquote>With very few exceptions, most of the things that matter in the way of permanent improvements on the stations were done by the pioneers of the sheep-farming industry during the period of 1860 and 1890, and those who have been responsible for the welfare of the industry since have not only failed to carry on the work of development at a normal rate, but they have actually failed - some woefully - to maintain that which was accomplished for them.</blockquote></blockquote><p>One of Munro's most significant recommendations was that an experimental farm should be established as soon as possible near Green Patch settlement, with a small stud flock of sheep and a herd of stud cattle. Their progeny should be sold and used to raise the quality of stock in the colony. This experimental farm could also investigate re-grassing methods, the growing of fodder crops, good practice in the management of cattle and sheep, the draining of waterlogged land, and more modern methods of providing shelter for sheep. He urged that all farms institute a proper system of farm accounting and the keeping of stock records. Munro's final recommendation was that farmers in the Islands organise themselves into an association to take joint decisions about matters of mutual interest.</p><p>After eight months, Munro returned to New Zealand. On his way home he met the Board of the Falkland Islands Company in London, on 8 January 1925. They unanimously resolved to thank Hugh Munro for his work, but rejected his assertion, as far as the FIC's farms were concerned, that overstocking caused pasture and stock deterioration.</p><p>At a meeting of the LegCo on 29 July 1925 it was resolved that: 'The establishment of the Government Experimental Farm, recommended by Mr Hugh Munro in his report ... was agreed on the motion of the Hon. G J <a href=\"/biographies/felton_george\">FELTON'</a>. In August 1925 the Experimental Farm was established at Lot 5 on Port Louis Farm. In October 1925, £17,000 was voted to establish the experimental farm, later increased to £24,000. It is also clear from a despatch by the colonial secretary that in addition to under-funding, there was considerable opposition to the project from some established farmers. With the arrival of a new governor - Sir Arnold <a href=\"/biographies/hodson_sir\">HODSON</a> - the experimental farm came under critical scrutiny and on 23 December 1927 the Colonial Office acceded to Hodson's request to close it down.</p><p>Munro's report and the story of the experimental farm show the difficulty of accomplishing agricultural reform on the Islands. Lack of continuity in leadership is well illustrated by the replacement, after a six-year term, of an experienced governor (Middleton) by a new man (Hodson) with very limited knowledge or experience of sheep farming.</p><p>After his meeting with the FIC Board in January 1925, Munro returned to New Zealand, and resumed his work for the Department of Agriculture. No further details of his life are currently known, but the will of a Hugh Munro was proved in 1938, and this may mark his death.</p>",

As a child on Long Island he showed interest in nature and the sea, then went on to study at Brown University in Providence Rhode Island, where he met his future wife Grace Alison Barstow. They had three children.</p><p>After graduation, Murphy signed on the whaling brig <em>Daisy </em>(Benjamin D Cleveland, master) as assistant navigator. Actually, he was an ornithologist supported jointly by the American Museum of Natural History in New York and the Brooklyn Museum. The <em>Daisy </em>was perhaps the last of the old free-for-all New England sailing vessels, taking whatever whales and seals its crew could find at sea or ashore. It reached South Georgia on 24 November 1912 and worked the Bay of Isles and Possession Bay from 15 December to 14 March 1913. Murphy had a boat of his own and for most of the time a work tent ashore, but he always returned to the ship at night. He rowed alone to Albatross Island and with sealers to distant beaches, witnessing the indiscriminate and illegal killing of female and young elephant seals. He described the 11 month cruise in <em>Logbook for Grace </em>(1947), dedicated to the newly-wed wife he had left at home, and later published photographs taken during the voyage in <em>A Dead Whale or a Stove Boat </em>(1967).</p><p>The field work and collection of sea birds Murphy made during the voyage of the <em>Daisy  </em>set his career in the direction it would follow for the rest of his life, firstly at the Brooklyn Museum and then at the American Museum of Natural History. Generous endowments from wealthy business men enabled the AMNH to charter vessels, keep professional collectors like Rollo Beck at sea and buy up the Rothschild and other collections when they came on the market, creating the foremost collection of sea birds in the world.</p><p>Murphy's expeditions to the guano islands of Peru and his many publications were crowned by his two volumes of <em>The Oceanic Birds of South America  </em>(1936), widely recognised as the founding work of sea bird science. In 1970, 58 years after the <em>Daisy </em>, he returned to South Georgia and three year later died on 20 March 1973.</p>",

        "body": "<p>governor of the French colony on the Malouines (Falklands), was a first cousin of Louis-Antoine de <a href=\"/biographies/bougainville_louis\">BOUGAINVILLE</a> the soldier and navigator, who was responsible for the establishment of the French colony. Bougainville de Nerville was a lawyer in the French <em>Parlement </em>, but had little interest in his profession. He admired the Canadian adventures of his younger cousin, Louis-Antoine de Bougainville and resolved that he too would like to see something of the great World. He decided to join his cousin in petitioning King Louis XV and in financing the Malouines project to the tune of 60 or 70,000 livres (Louis-Antoine de Bougainville subscribed 95,000 livres and an uncle, d'Arboulin, 30,000). Like his cousin and the captains of the <em>Aigle </em>and the <em>Sphinx </em>, de Nerville had no fixed salary during the voyage and was carried on the books of the <em>Aigle </em>as an <em>officier major </em>(senior officer) and volunteer.</p><p>De Nerville was in the first boat to land on the Islands with Bougainville on 3 February 1764. After tents had been erected and some dwellings and a fort for the settlement had been built, early in April, the ceremony of taking possession was held, during which a letter from the King, appointing de Nerville as commander of Fort Saint-Louis (Port Louis) in the îles Malouines was handed to him by Bougainville. Twenty-nine colonists, headed by de Nerville, with a clerk, storekeeper and surgeon were left when the <em>Aigle </em>and the <em>Sphinx </em>returned to France. A further fifty or more colonists were embarked aboard the <em>Aigle </em>when she sailed again from France on 6 October 1764, under Bougainville's command, with royal approval for what had already been accomplished in the Falklands, and with plans for a town, to be called Ville-Dubuc. However, on Bougainville's return to Paris in August the following year, full of praise for his cousin who had 'behaved like an angel', he learnt that his colony was to be abandoned, despite its success. So the <em>Aigle </em>and the <em>Etoile </em>sailed without him in November 1765 arriving in March and February respectively with more colonists, and supplies. The report on the colony brought back for Bougainville at the end of the homeward voyage, praised his cousin's efforts. Beloved by all, de Nerville had done wonders - constructing stores, growing cereals and vegetables and creating pastures, as well as making a reconnaissance of much of the island (East Falkland).</p><p>De Nerville sent a letter to Dom <a href=\"/biographies/pernetty_antoine-joseph\">PERNETTY</a> written in the Malouine Islands on 25 April 1765, which was carried by <a href=\"/biographies/bougainville_louis\">BOUGAINVILLE</a> to France giving an account of life in the new colony. Referring to his first winter on the Falklands de Nerville wrote:</p><blockquote><blockquote>It has not been severe, for there was never snow enough to cover one's shoe-buckles, nor a sufficient depth of ice to support a stone as big as one's fist: and if it had not been for the rain, which runs through our tents as through a sieve, we should have had very little occasion for fire, which we were now obliged to make in order to dry ourselves.</blockquote></blockquote><p>He told Pernetty that he would not have known the colony, had he returned because of all the improvements that had been made. These included a fine walk, twenty feet wide, of smooth even ground, a new powder magazine, a fort completely repaired, a bakehouse and a forge. Some 1500 'bustards' had been killed, but his attempts to raise a brood, fostered by a hen, had come to nothing, owing to the 'mischievous tricks of the ship-boys' from France. The heifers and horses had needed no shelter during the winter, while the land was being improved with good dung. Nor was the study of natural history forgotten: de Nerville sent a package of shells, seeds and rocks to Dom Pernetty with Bougainville. The French minister, Choiseul, approved the appointment of de Nerville as major in September 1765, when he was thirty-five years of age.</p><p>When Bougainville himself returned to wind up the settlement in March 1767 in the <em>Boudeuse </em>, at the beginning of his celebrated circumnavigation, he had nothing but praise for de Nerville. All was well at Fort St Louis, where the settlement was beginning to take shape. Two fine stone houses had been built for the governor and the clerk cum storekeeper, while the remaining settlers lived in cottages whose walls were made of turf. Timber from the Strait of Magellan had enabled three shops and two schooners to be built, suitable for surveying the coast. Grain from Europe had naturalised, while domestic animals had multiplied. Of the 135 inhabitants all were healthy and in good spirits. In December 1766 the arrival of the British warship <em>Jason </em>(30 guns), Captain John McBRIDE, had surprised the French and had led to an exchange of letters between de Nerville and the British naval officer who was in charge of the newly established settlement at Port Egmont, in the west Falklands.</p><p>Bougainville outlined to de Nerville the arrangements with Spain for the abandonment of the French colony, and during the evening of his return, he heard de Nerville's account of the arrival of the <em>Jason. </em>The colony was in due course handed over to the Spaniards, after arrangements had been agreed for compensation for its three promoters and the future of the colonists. The <em>Boudeuse </em>continued on her round-the-world voyage of Pacific exploration, but de Nerville disembarked at Montevideo on 10 November 1767, in order to return to France from Buenos Aires, having found life at sea too uncomfortable to bear.</p>",

        "body": "<p>colonist and voyager, was born on 13 April 1853 in Hampshire, the son of George and Eleanor (Ellen) Newman. There was already a connection with far-flung British colonies, as George Newman was born around 1822 on St Helena, where his father had been stationed as part of the contingent guarding Napoleon. Fred Newman served for a time on HMS <em>Challenger </em>doing admiralty surveys and came to the Falklands from Portsmouth in 1880 to work on West Falkland. On 31 May 1880 he married Hannah Caroline (Annie) Hollen, the daughter of David Henry Hollen, a German dairyman from Bremen who had come to the Islands around 1860 to work for the FIC, and Charlotte Short, a daughter of John Short, one of the Military <a href=\"/biographies/pensioners_the\">PENSIONERS</a>.</p><p>In May 1901 the family were moving back to Stanley from Teal Inlet where Fred Newman had been working for some years. The cutter <em>Shamrock </em>of Stanley had gone out to bring the family and their furniture to Stanley but as he had built a boat in his spare time and wished to bring it to town, he decided to sail the 35-40 miles with his nine year old son, Frederick John, as in fine weather he could expect to complete the voyage in nine hours. On Sunday 5 May at 9.30am he set off before the <em>Shamrock,  </em>which later passed him off Volunteer Rocks, carrying his wife and five other children. When hailed he seemed happy so they carried on to Stanley ahead of him. He was last seen from the Johnson Harbour camp on the afternoon of 6 May about three miles from land north of Volunteer Rocks - a gale from the south west was blowing and the cutter was tossing about. By the morning of 7 May the small boat had been blown well out from land and Fred Newman could only just see Cape Pembroke lighthouse. Although he tried to put back he was unable to hoist his sails, as some of his gear had been lost, so they drifted at the mercy of the winds first south of the Islands then north.</p><p>Luckily, as the family were moving to Stanley, Fred Newman had on board a small quantity of cooked meat, a whole dead sheep, a salted young pig, bread, 20lbs of flour, and 2oz of tea (which he smoked when his tobacco ran out). Even more fortunately, he had removed approximately 200lbs of swedes and turnips and 120lbs of potatoes from his Teal Inlet garden and these provided moisture when the seven gallons of water they had on board was used up within 21 days. Realising by the change in temperature that they were well north of the Islands by then, Fred Newman decided to try for the Patagonian Coast. For five days he sailed westward (with limited rigging), getting within a short distance of land before the currents carried them out again. For the next six days they sailed around trying to reach the Coast again and during this time a heavy fall of rain enabled them to collect some water. By now both had swollen limbs and young Fred's feet and ankles were only saved by his father rubbing them with turpentine. Finally on 6 July after 62 days on the high seas in a boat only 26ft 7ins long by 8ft 2ins broad and 3ft 6 ins draught, they were within easy reach of the Coast again between Cape Raso and Camerones in Chubut when they were spotted and rescued at 4pm by the Argentine transport <em>Guardia Nacional </em>. She took them to Buenos Aires where she was bound with 29 of the wrecked crew from the <em>Dumbarton Castle </em>whom she had picked up at Staten Island {Isla de los Estades}.</p><p>On 10 August Fred Newman and his son were finally returned to Stanley on board the <em>Orellana </em>to rejoin his family and new three month old daughter, born while he was lost at sea. In September's Church Magazine it was reported: 'here he is safe and sound in Stanley once more, going about his daily work as if it had been never interrupted and looking and feeling (so he says) none the worse for his wonderful adventure'. As for the boat, she was sold on the Coast due to the difficulty and expense of returning her to the Falklands and is supposed to be to this day in a museum on the River Plate.</p><p>In 1919, young Frederick John returned to Montevideo as one of the crew of the SS <em>Falkland </em>which was undergoing repairs there. On 6 November he fell into the dock and being unable to swim drowned despite the best efforts of his crewmate, Tom Curran.</p><p>From 1903 to 1938 Fred Newman and his family lived at 4 Drury Street. A family anecdote tells how he built the chimney. He was working at the dockyard at the time and apparently each day his wife would send his terrier Fox down with his lunch in custom made saddlebags. Fred would remove his lunch then place a brick in each bag and send the dog home again. He was also told that he was not allowed to build a new porch on the front of the house as the existing porch extended out onto the footpath so he demolished the old porch and put up a new one all in one night, much to the amusement of his neighbours.</p><p>The Newmans were true characters who had hard lives but never lost their sense of humour. They had 20 children, 11 of whom they outlived. Fred Newman finally passed away on 8 September 1938, almost exactly a year after his wife. Both are buried in Stanley Cemetery along with 15 of their children.</p>",

        "body": "<p>Swedish explorer and scientist, was born on 6 December 1869 on the estate Sjögle, Mariannelund, Småland, Sweden. He had four sisters and his father, Gustaf Nordenskjöld, was an army captain. His mother, Anna, born Nordenskiöld (note different spelling), was the sister of the well known polar explorer Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld, who was the first to sail through the North-East Passage between Europe and the Far East. Adolf Erik may have inspired Otto Nordenskjöld's development into a geologist and polar explorer but there were many other members of the family who had explored distant corners of the world.</p><p>His early schooling was carried out in Jönköping and Östersund, and in 1886 he started at the University of Uppsala, to study chemistry and geology. In 1894 he presented his PhD and became an assistant professor of mineralogy and geology. This made it possible for Nordenskjöld to start his career of research exploration and already in 1894 he started to plan for Antarctic exploration. His first expedition however was to Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego in 1895 to 1897 where he established contacts that were to be valuable during his Antarctic expedition. In 1898, his second expedition went to Klondyke in Alaska and in 1900 he participated as geologist in CG Amdrup's expedition to the east coast of Greenland. On the way back he met his wife to be, Karen Berg, the daughter of a Norwegian whaler living in Dyrafjord on Iceland.</p><p>When he returned to Sweden, Nordenskjöld started to plan his expedition to the Antarctic. CA <a href=\"/biographies/larsen_carl\">LARSEN</a> was engaged as Captain and the expedition ship <em>Antarctic </em>purchased. In October 1901 the expedition left Sweden, arriving in Buenos Aires on 16 December. They also visited the Falkland Islands on 30-31 December to pick up a number of dogs and two able seamen before continuing south. When they arrived in Stanley they visited the Swedish Consulate, and Nordenskjöld and C A Larsen visited Governor GREY <a href=\"/biographies/wilson_james\">WILSON</a>. They were invited to celebrate New Year's Eve at Government House which they did. They bought a number of dogs which they took with them to the Antarctic and before leaving on New Year's Day 1902, Nordenskjöld was able to ride out into Camp and study stone runs, which interested him as a geologist.</p><p>The expedition built a house on Snow Hill Island on the east coast of the Antarctic Peninsula, and during the southern winter of 1902 parts of the expedition spent time on South Georgia, exploring the Island and naming various places including Grytviken. During this period they also visited the Falklands a couple of times. In the southern summer of 1902-3 the <em>Antarctic </em>tried to return to Snow Hill to relieve the wintering party but the ice situation was so bad that the ship was crushed and sank on 12 February 1903. So they all had to spend another winter in the Antarctic, spread out in three different locations. An Argentine relief expedition with the ship <em>Uruguay </em>was able to rescue them all on 8 November 1903 and they were brought back to Buenos Aires.</p><p>After returning from the Antarctic, Nordenskjöld became professor at the University of Gothenburg in 1905 and the same year he married Karen Berg. They had four children, Anna (b1906), Estrid (b1909), Gustaf (b1911) and Martha (b1914). His last polar expedition took him to Greenland in 1909 but his final expedition was to Peru and Chile in 1920-21.</p><p>On 2 June 1928 Nordenskjöld was run over by a bus close to his home in Gothenburg: ironic that he, who so often exposed himself to great dangers in his expeditions, lost his life in a traffic accident outside his home. During his career, he published and participated in a large number of articles and books including <em>Two Years in the Antarctic </em>(1904) and <em>Scientific Results of the Swedish South Polar Expedition 1902-1903 </em>(1904-20, 6 volumes, 4000 pages).

        "body": "<p>Irish patriot, yachtsman and writer was born in Co Limerick, Ireland on 3 November 1880, the son of Edward William O'Brien and an Englishwoman, Julia Mary, née Marshall. He was a grandson of William Smith O'Brien of the 'Young Ireland' political movement. Schooled at Winchester College, England, he graduated with a fourth class degree in natural sciences from Oxford in 1903 and practised as a naval architect from 1906 to 1914. He was a patriot, a mountaineer, a fluent Irish speaker and outspoken Home Rule supporter who was involved in the gun running to Howth, Co Dublin, on behalf of the Irish Volunteers in July 1914 - an activity combining his sailing and political enthusiasms. This did not prevent him serving as a lieutenant in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve in World War I.</p><p>O'Brien designed two famous yachts both of which had close connections with the Falklands - the  <em>Saoirse </em>and the  <em>Ilen </em>. In  <em>Saoirse </em>, ('Freedom') a 20 ton, 42 foot ketch designed and built in 1922 in Baltimore, Co Cork he made a famous circumnavigation between 1923 and 1925 - the first recorded by an amateur skipper from west to east. His account of the voyage,  <em>Across Three Oceans </em>, (1927) became one of the classics of maritime literature.</p><p>On 6 December 1924 he 'put in most properly to the Falkland Islands being again short of potatoes'. He had sailed directly from Auckland, New Zealand in 46 days, covering almost six thousand miles and was, by chance, accompanied in to Port William by the Government yacht <em>Gwendolin </em>. He decided to spend just a few weeks in the Falklands (he stayed until 28 February 1925) and was famously entertained by both civic and private society in the Islands. His normally ascetic and critical description of landfalls was mellowed for the Falklands, apart from commenting on 'the amenities of Stanley - of which there are none' and the harshness of the climate:</p><blockquote><blockquote>There is no soil, no warmth in the sun, no trees will grow, and only the hardiest weeds; though it is true that a few enthusiasts have constructed gardens in the lee of a stout fence and even reported to have raised potatoes therein.</blockquote></blockquote><p>Indeed, he describes horticulture in even 'the more genial West Falkland' as 'a farce'. Otherwise he speaks highly of the hospitality received (especially in the West) and of the services given (freely) to him, his crew and the  <em>Saoirse </em>. Nowhere else had he been afforded the luxury of lying up at the Government Jetty and Boatyard. The governor commanded the Seal Protection Cruiser to take him round the coast and he has vivid descriptions of colonies of penguins at West Point (which 'might have been in West Cork') and Carcass Island and fur seals on the Jason Islands. He commented on the favourable qualities of Tussac Grass as a cattle feed. O'Brien spent Christmas in Stanley and afterwards took his yacht to San Carlos to beach her and scrape down the hull. He eventually beached her in Camilla Creek to undertake the job. He humorously recalls being taken in the Ford at Darwin (imported by TG <a href=\"/biographies/slaughter_thomas\">SLAUGHTER</a>, the FIC camp manager) despite the absence of roads. O'Brien 'was commanded' to go on the mail steamer to the South Shetland Islands (past O'Brien Island) and he provides valuable and vivid descriptions of the nature of the whaling business at that time - 'apart from whales the South Shetlands have no excuse for existing'. During his absence  <em>Saoirse </em>was well looked after at the Government Dockyard. He carved a coat of arms for the colony at the request of the Colonial Secretary. He returned to Ireland on 20 June 1925.</p><p>Either through his direct contact with TG Slaughter on the Falklands, or a reported chance contact in London (when he went to change a Falkland Islands one pound note) he was asked to design a service vessel for the FIC. The  <em>Ilen </em>(named after the river which flows into Baltimore where she too was built) was finally launched in the spring of 1926. O'Brien, having personally supervised the construction of the 56 foot auxiliary ketch, also undertook to deliver the vessel to the Falklands. She sailed for the Falklands from Ilfracombe, Devon on 31 August 1926 with O'Brien as skipper and two local Cape Clear seamen as crew (the cousins Denis and Con Cadogan). During her delivery voyage  <em>Ilen </em>put in at several ports including Mar del Plata in Argentina, whose claim to the Falklands found favour with O'Brien. O'Brien and the  <em>Ilen </em>reached the Falklands on 8 January 1927 to a warm reception. The vessel subsequently plied the waters of the Falklands profitably for nearly 50 years. She was eventually returned to Ireland (in November 1997) for restoration in Dublin and exhibition in the Hunt Museum, Limerick. The  <em>Ilen </em>featured on the 35p value Falklands stamp in the 1998 issue 'local vessels'.</p><p>O'Brien continued to sail but was deemed too old for active service in 1939. He did however serve the Allied cause as a skipper for the Small Ships Pool, delivering support vessels across the Atlantic. In 1928 he married the artist Katherine Clausen, though she died tragically in 1936. O'Brien retired in the west of Ireland, living with his sister, and died on Foynes Island, Co Limerick on 25 April 1952.</p><p>O'Brien wrote 14 books, which included:  <em>Across Three Oceans, From Three Yachts, On Going to Sea in Yachts, Voyage and Discovery, Deep Water Yacht Rig, The Small Ocean Going Yacht  </em>and <em>Yacht Gear and Gadgets. </em>The apostrophe, usual in Irish family names, was sometimes omitted by O Brien.</p>",

        "body": "<p>governor, was born in Bristol of Irish parents on 6 May 1866. He was educated at St. Mary's Roman Catholic School which he left at an early age to work in a mineral factory, but at the age of 15 he was apprenticed for five years to a Bristol chairmaker. In 1887 he married Louisa James, a teacher; she was a great help to him in his studies and in his work. He and his wife were practising Catholics all their lives. They had ten children, three sons and seven daughters. Theirs was a wonderful family life; all the children were taught a musical instrument and on Sunday evenings a family concert was held.</p><p><strong>The Labour Movement and Russia</strong></p><p>O'Grady worked in various parts of the country for three years during which time he came into contact with socialist ideas and trade unionism. He then returned to Bristol to serve as president of the Bristol Trades Council, and become a member of the City Council. In 1898, at the age of thirty-two, he was president of the Trades Union Congress (TUC) which met in Bristol. In his presidential address, he proposed that a scheme be formed for the political organisation of the trade union movement, and two years later the TUC acted upon this suggestion and the Labour Party was born.</p><p>In 1906 O'Grady was elected to Parliament as the Labour member for East Leeds, and held the seat until 1924. During the war years he visited the Western Front and undertook several special missions for the government, including one to Ireland for a recruitment campaign. Perhaps his most important missions were to Russia. After the first revolution of February 1917, he was appointed by the War Cabinet to join a joint British and French delegation to impress on the moderate Kerensky Government the vital importance of continuing the war against Germany. In November 1919 O'Grady, was appointed to negotiate in Copenhagen with the Soviet commissar Litvinov on the exchange of British prisoners of war and the repatriation of British civilians in Russia: ultimately an agreement was reached. O'Grady visited Russia again in 1922, to administer relief with funds provided by the International Federation of Trade Unions for the famine areas around Kazan. He contracted smallpox on his return home.</p><p><strong>Governor of Tasmania</strong></p><p>O'Grady was appointed governor of Tasmania in 1924 and created KCMG. Despite some initial criticism of the appointment, it was a great success and he was asked to stay on for a further two years. Sadly, Lady O'Grady was unable to accompany her husband to Tasmania as she was suffering from cancer but two of his daughters accompanied Sir James to Tasmania and Margaret, the younger, remained to support her father in the role of first lady of the colony. Lady O'Grady died in 1929.</p><p><strong>The Falkland Islands </strong></p><p>In the spring of 1931, after only one month at home since his return from Tasmania, O'Grady accepted the appointment of governor and commander-in-chief of the Falkland Islands and Dependencies. In an article in the <em>News Chronicle </em>of 29 April, he gave his reasons for accepting, namely 'a love of the work of Colonial administration. When I think of the fine work being done in all parts of the world by handfuls of our men, I cannot bear the thought of settling down and doing nothing. It is not in my make up to do so'.</p><p>O'Grady arrived in Stanley on 20 June on the SS <em>Darwin </em>. He had been in correspondence with Buckingham Palace since 1917 and spoke of his royal connection at his swearing in:</p><blockquote><blockquote>His Majesty the King has requested me to inform you of his kind interest in you. That may seem a rather far-fetched idea, but most of us follow His Majesty in that respect. We consider this Empire of ours a natural living reality. It is a body politic. It is just as real and just as living as my body is real and living. It is a personality: an entity, representative of our characters and all we stand for. Down in this far away Island in the Southern Atlantic the people of the Falklands have got just those same faculties and qualities that our forefathers had who went abroad for adventure and found it ...You are here in the Falklands and I want you to love the Falklands. To many of you it is your Homeland of the Empire. The more you love it the greater will be your love for the Empire of which it forms a part.</blockquote></blockquote><p>Settling into his new home must have been a lonely time, having no member of his family with him. His daughter Margaret, who had been with him in Tasmania, offered to accompany him but Sir James declined, telling her 'it's no place for a woman'.</p><p>The governor's first public appearance was in August, at the new Power House in Stanley for the ceremonial switching on of the town's electrified system of street lighting. In November he visited Bull Point which is frequented by elephant seals. In January 1932, 'shearing time', the governor made a three week tour of the farm stations by boat, landing at the jetties by launch, 'a rather bumpy procedure' he reports. Sir James continued his letter to the King's private secretary Sir Clive Wigram:</p><blockquote><blockquote>The sheep farmers and their employees are a fine lot of men. Their lonely life makes them reticent, disliking talk, but when one gets them to 'thaw out' their conversation about their work and domestic affairs is indeed interesting. Their children are educated by travelling teachers, employed by the Government, and the respect in which these teachers are held by the parents is a feature that is wholly blessed. I came away from these folks a better man, I am certain, than before I met them. They were kind enough to say that my talk was helpful and pressed that I should make my visits frequent.</blockquote></blockquote><p>At St Mary's Bazaar he spoke appreciatively of the good will between the different Christian missions and, as a member of the Roman Catholic Church, of the heroic work being done by Father <a href=\"/biographies/migone_mario\">MIGONE</a> and the Sisters.</p><p><strong>1933: Centenary Year</strong></p><p>The celebration of the Falklands Centenary in 1933 began with a tribute to the memory of Matthew <a href=\"/biographies/brisbane_matthew\">BRISBANE</a>. The <em>Lafonia </em>carrying the governor and 123 other passengers sailed from Stanley to Port Louis and a wreath was laid at Brisbane's grave where the weather beaten wooden marker was replaced with a new marble gravestone.</p><p>The celebrations continued with a week of festivities described by the Governor in a letter to his daughter Mary (Molly):</p><blockquote><blockquote>Curiously enough we had the weather of the century - a week of glorious, warm sunshine.</blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>We had the H.M.S. Durban in, also Discovery II, the latter is the research ship that has, for some time, been investigating sea life and currents.</blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>The proceedings opened with a review, under arms, on the large paddock facing Government House. I took the salute in full uniform, afterwards attending service at the Cathedral.</blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>Throughout the week, there was horse racing, sports, dancing in the Town Hall every night and a fine display of fireworks. Ninety percent of the total population of the colony were in Stanley for the celebrations.</blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>I am persuading the folks to have a \"do\" every 3 years so that the feeling of mutual regard generated shall be perpetuated. The sheep farmers and their shepherds rarely come in to Stanley, therefore they and the town people are complete strangers. It will be to the good of the colony if they meet every 3 years and have a week of festivities.</blockquote></blockquote><p>He reported to Wigram:</p><blockquote><blockquote>Going back to the Centenary celebrations. I must say that I was agreeably surprised at the behaviour of the men from the camp, having regard to the lonely life they lead and to the fact that many of them had never been in Stanley before, and I took care at the final function on the Saturday night to express publicly my sincere thanks for their behaviour through the week. Of course a few of them quite naturally partook rather freely of the strong - very strong - beer we import and being myself naturally of a cautious turn of mind - you may not believe that - I had about twelve special constables sworn in but gave them definite instructions that they were to arrest no man, no matter what his style of walking might be at the moment, but instead they were to take him to his diggings [ie digs] and get him put to bed. So there were no arrests and no gaoling.</blockquote></blockquote><p>The Governor laid the foundation stone for a swimming pool, telling Wigram:</p><blockquote><blockquote>Our swimming pool, I am afraid, will not be built yet owing to the lack of finances. However it is a beginning and such a swimming pool is a very great necessity here as there are only about fifteen men and boys in the whole colony who can really swim. I am hoping that some of the better-to-do people will help me with the financing of this project.</blockquote></blockquote><p>The celebrations were appropriately concluded with the gift of a fine silver 'smoking set' from the City of Bristol for use at Government House (the cigar box is still held at GH).</p><p>The centenary stirred Argentina's sovereignty claim, as he reported to Wigram:</p><blockquote><blockquote>They will not recognise our passports and insist upon our people when they arrive in the Argentine, taking out another passport. There are some other acts of theirs that while irritating need not be commented upon but the last of their pretensions - the matter of our Centenary Stamps - seems to be about the limit. Our stamps are declared to be invalid when the Falkland Islands' people write to their friends in the Argentine; they are surcharged and a fine is imposed before delivery can be effected. Further than that, they have written to the International Postal Bureau at Berne informing them that in view of Argentina's 'Sovereign Rights' they are to take notice that the Falkland Islands stamps are invalid. Incidentally, from the philatelists' point of view the stamps will become much more valuable as a result of this extraordinary attitude of the Argentine.</blockquote></blockquote><p><strong>Departure </strong></p><p>It was announced on 1 July 1933 that the governor was indisposed and had gone in to Hospital. O'Grady departed on 8 July in the SS <em>Lafonia  </em>bound for Montevideo and thence for England. He left a farewell message:</p><blockquote><blockquote>I am hoping to be back with you again recovered in health sufficiently to help in carrying through a number of projects that I have in mind leading to more efficient government and increase of the welfare of the people of the Colony.</blockquote></blockquote><p>The cause of his 'indisposition' was given in the British press as blood poisoning; he had also suffered for many years from diabetes. After some initial improvement, his health declined and he remained on sick leave, living with his family, until his death in a London nursing home on 10 December 1934.</p><p>On the day before O'Grady left for England, the colonial manager of the Falkland Islands Company, LWH <a href=\"/biographies/young_leonard\">YOUNG</a> wrote to his directors in London:</p><blockquote><blockquote>I fear he is unlikely to return, which is to be regretted. I have always found him to [be] reasonable and just; he had a keen perception of the difficulties of the farmers, but has been greatly handicapped during his administration by the legacies left him by his predecessor and by unemployment.</blockquote></blockquote><p>O'Grady's departure meant that the colony was without a governor for 17 months.</p><p><a href=\"/biographies/brisbane_matthew\">See Image 62</a></p>",

During a stay of 10 months, he learnt practical skills as well as Christian fundamentals.</p><p>On their return to Wulaia, Navarin Island, at the beginning of November, Okokko witnessed, but did not take part in, the massacre of the mission party of nine men with the exception of Alfred Coles, the cook. Okokko and his companion subsequently placed the bodies together and protected them with rocks. Afterwards he pleaded to be allowed to return to Keppel, which he did with his wife, Camilenna.</p><p>In 1863, when the <a href=\"/biographies/stirling_waite\">STIRLING</a> family arrived in Keppel to take charge of the mission work, they found there, in addition to the <a href=\"/biographies/bartlett_william\">BARTLETT</a> family and Thomas <a href=\"/biographies/bridges_thomas\">BRIDGES</a>, Okokko and his wife and two children. By this time Okokko's grasp of English and the Christian faith had greatly improved and in return he had helped Bridges to learn Yahgan and understand his people's customs. As a result, Stirling was able to set off for Tierra del Fuego to visit the Indians for the first time since the massacre, taking with him Okokko and Bridges to act as interpreters. Okokko's task was to explain to his fellow Indians the purpose of the Keppel Mission. Such was his success that 11 of the hearers decided to go there with him on board the <em>Allen Gardiner </em>. In early 1864, it was decided that Okokko and family should go back to Wulaia to live, properly established in their own house and garden following the pattern of life they had learned on Keppel. It was on this visit that Okokko identified to Stirling the place where the 1859 massacre had taken place, thus allowing six of the dead to be given a Christian burial.</p><p>On a visit to Okokko a year later, the missionaries found that, having established himself and family well, jealous tribesmen had destroyed his house and garden. In view of Stirling's impending visit to England, it was decided to take him and his family back to Keppel. After Stirling's return to Keppel in April 1867, he decided to set up on Navarin Island a small settlement of Indians who had been at Keppel. Okokko was to take charge. Stirling planned to establish himself permanently on the opposite shore of the Beagle Channel on what is now the site of Ushuaia. Stirling's stay in 1869 among the Indians lasted only seven months until he was called to London to be consecrated bishop. In 1872, Okokko and Camilenna and their five children were the first of 36 Indians to be baptised by Thomas <a href=\"/biographies/bridges_thomas\">BRIDGES</a>. Little is recorded about Okokko afterwards. He died c1906 at Ushuaia, one of the last of the surviving Yahgan Indians.</p><p>Okokko and his wife were key figures in introducing the missionaries to the Yahgan language and culture. They convinced their countrymen of the benefits of Christianity and of embracing European values.</p>",

        "body": "<p>Norwegian whaling manager, was born in Sandefjord, Norway on 3 December 1910, son of Nils Bertinius Olsen and Andrea Gulliksen, née Ellingsen. His father died of TB before his son was born in 1910 and his widow emigrated to Brooklyn, New York where Nils Erling spent his first years, returning to Sandefjord at the age of 12. His foster father was a coppersmith, who delivered goods and services to the expanding whaling industry and in 1927, Olsen boarded the whale factory ship <em>Southern Queen </em>. This ship was sunk by ice in the Southern Ocean in February 1928, but he continued working as a whaler, and like many Norwegians, made the industry his career.</p><p>In 1935 he married Mabel Augenie Lien: they had two daughters, Unni Rigemor (b1936) and Sissel Olette (b1950) and a son Nils Eivind (b1941). Olsen was a family man, a loving and careful father and husband. He and his wife created a good home for their family and Mabel and their eldest daughter were to spend one season with him in Husvik.</p><p>In 1938, Olsen passed his final exams with the best results ever achieved in Norway and became a chief engineer. During World War II he took part in the Norwegian resistance movement and was taken prisoner by the occupying forces, spending some years in a prisoner-of-war camp. Here he learnt to speak fluent German, as he foresaw that after the war the international whaling fleet would need not only the German whale factory ships, but also the German shipyards. In 1946-47 he was employed by A/S Kosmos and he took an active part in converting the former German factory ship <em>Walter Rau </em>to become <em>Kosmos IV </em>, ready for whaling.</p><p>In 1950 Olsen was employed by A/S Tønsbergs Hvalfangeri as whaling manager of Husvik Harbour, South Georgia. It was now obvious that not only whale-oil, but also by-products would become more and more important to profitability. Here, again, he worked on modernizing the machinery for producing whale-oil, and on meeting the increasing interest in a better utilization of the carcass. Meat extract became a more and more important product, and it was continually improved. He also renewed the catching equipment, and in 1953/54 a new production record of 64,765 barrels of oil was reached.</p><p>There were enormous resources of fish around South Georgia, and to exploit these resources he hired two purse seine boats from Northern Norway in 1951. However, this experiment failed, as neither vessels nor equipment were suited for southern waters.</p><p>Olsen strongly disliked the whalers' use of Asdic* to catch whales. In his opinion Asdic would frighten and disturb the whales and he even made the authorities forbid its use for a period. But the opposition from other South Georgia stations became too strong, and after some time the prohibition was removed. Olsen cooperated with the University of Oslo on locating whales by listening to them communicating through ultrasonic sound. This was only one of many examples of this co-operation with the university during his time as a manager in Husvik Harbour.</p><p>Many efforts were made to obtain a better utilisation of the whales, and a large refrigeration plant was built in Husvik Harbour (1958). Fresh whale meat could be frozen in suitable packages, and the first cargo was sent to England for use in dog food.</p><p>As whaling manager Olsen assisted scientific expeditions visiting Husvik Harbour. His villa was well known for its hospitality, to the British South Georgia Expeditions, Duncan <a href=\"/biographies/carse_verner\">CARSE</a>'s surveys and activities for the International Geophysical Year 1957-59. When MV <em>Theron </em>returned from the Trans-Antarctic Expedition in 1956, her bow was badly damaged, but Olsen's great technical skill and flair for improvisation helped to accomplish a temporary repair. As an acknowledgement of hospitality, help and assistance to every scientific expedition visiting Husvik, the Director of Overseas Surveys decided to name the valley from Stromness Bay south to Cumberland Bay West, the Olsen Valley.</p><p>In 1960 whaling in Husvik Harbour was closed down, and the station, several of the catchers and the transport ship <em>Teie </em>were sold to Alfredo <a href=\"/biographies/ryan_alfredo\">RYAN</a>'s company Albion Star at Grytviken. After this Olsen was employed by shipowner Lars Christensen of A/S Thor Dahl Shipping Company, to be in charge of the processing plant on board the floating factory <em>Thorshøvdi </em>. However, whaling came to an end for Thor Dahl, too, and Olsen then became responsible for the conversion of <em>Thorshavet  </em>in 1969. The ship was renamed <em>Astra </em>and became mother ship for a fishing fleet operating off the West African coast. After the <em>Astra </em>years he continued with the Thor Dahl Company as technical supervisor for their rapidly growing tanker fleet. He died of cancer in 1975, 65 years old.</p><p>Olsen was a large muscular man, strong and sturdy. His superiors as well as his employers showed him great recognition by giving him many demanding tasks. He always behaved calmly and always treated his workers with respect. He had an enormous capacity for hard work and to a great extent was self-taught, constructing a number of plants for a better utilisation of the different parts of the whale, making the drawings himself and then following up on the construction. A very gifted man, he played several musical instruments and started and organised HBS, Husvik Broadcasting Station. This was very popular among the whalers at the different stations and on board whale catchers offshore. The station broadcast light music, and at fixed hours there was news on the FM band. Apart from cinema performances this was the only entertainment for the whalers. His favourite hobby was drawing and painting and a lot of situations were vividly caught in his caricatures. His oil paintings were placed in messes and welfare rooms, and, of course, in the Husvik Villa. Some of his paintings are in the Whaling Museum in Sandefjord and in the South Georgia Museum at Grytviken.</p>",

        "body": "<p>writer and biologist, was born at Strawberry Hill, London, on 22 April 1903, one of the five children of Olive Caroline, née Owen, wife of Colonel Francis Frederick Ommanney. After Aldenham School, Ommanney went to a business training college in London and then studied at the Imperial College of Science and Technology, London. He was an assistant lecturer in zoology at East London College (later Queen Mary College) 1926-29, but did not enjoy teaching. He received a PhD from London University.</p><p>In September 1929 Ommanney left England aboard the Norwegian whaling factory ship  <em>Antarctic </em>for South Georgia, to take up a position as zoologist with the Discovery Investigations, whose marine biological station at King Edward's Point, Grytviken, had been collecting whaling data for five years. Ommanney's  <em>South Latitude  </em>(1938) has his evocative and self-deprecating descriptions of life on a twentieth-century whaling station, and of the local wildlife. His first view of the Island was striking:</p><blockquote><blockquote>When I awoke in the morning the fog had gone and in its place was a scene of breath-taking beauty ... Behind [the ship] ... rose the high white mountains of South Georgia, towering into the clear sky ... The whole scene was one of cold and flashing splendour and filled me with a strange exhilaration, an enthusiasm for this, my new white home.</blockquote></blockquote><p>In 1929-30, the purpose-built RRS  <em>Discovery II </em>, captained by Commander WM Carey and with Dr Stanley <a href=\"/biographies/kemp_stanley\">KEMP</a> as scientific leader, made her maiden voyage. Ommanney worked on South Georgia for seven months in the southern summer of 1929-30, and then at whaling stations in Durban, South Africa, during winter 1930. After another five months of summer work at South Georgia in 1930/31, he returned to England on  <em>Discovery II </em>for the southern winter of 1931, and worked at the British Museum (Natural History), London, until he went south again the following southern spring.</p><p>Carey was also commander for  <em>Discovery II </em>'s second commission of 1931-33, working in the Falklands sector of Antarctica primarily on biological (especially krill  <em>Euphausia </em>spp.) and hydrological <em> </em>surveys, and also circumnavigating Antarctica. The ship left Port Stanley in November 1931, and anchored at Deception Island, South Shetland Islands. She then visited the South Orkney Islands where Ommanney collected and made biological observations on Fredericksen Island. In January 1932, while making an oceanographic survey,  <em>Discovery II </em>was caught in the pack ice of the southern Weddell Sea and narrowly avoided a longer besetment. Ommanney remained on board for the journey to South Africa in March 1932.  <em>Discovery II </em>returned eastward from Cape Town on 8 April 1932, zigzagging south into Antarctic waters three times over the southern winter before arriving at Stanley on 9 October 1932.</p><p>Six days later, Ommanney <em> </em>left Stanley on board  <em>Discovery II </em>for the 1932-33 season's surveying and oceanographic work (more than 9000 echo soundings were made during the 1931-33 commission). The ship visited the area north of the South Orkneys in November-December 1932. After Christmas at South Georgia,  <em>Discovery II </em>arrived at the South Orkney Islands on 2 January 1933. During January, all islands of the group except Laurie Island were surveyed. With the other scientists, Ommanney landed on the largely ice-covered islands to collect plants and animals ashore. The first known landing on Inaccessible Island in the west of the South Orkney Islands was made at this time. After the South Orkneys, the ship returned to oceanographic work leaving South Georgia for England on 1 March 1933; during her return voyage Commander Carey was lost overboard in the Bay of Biscay.</p><p>When in England the Discovery Investigations scientists such as Ommanney were based at the British Museum (Natural History). His final  <em>Discovery II  </em>voyage was in October 1935 - May 1937.</p><p>On 15 October 1936,  <em>Discovery II </em>arrived at Grytviken, South Georgia, where ornithologist Brian <a href=\"/biographies/roberts_brian\">ROBERTS</a> joined the ship. After working around South Georgia, the ship sailed for the South Shetlands. With Deacon and Roberts on 13 November 1936, Ommanney landed on a shingle beach half a mile east of Cape Bowles, the southernmost point of Clarence Island. After visiting the Falklands and spending Christmas at Grytviken,  <em>Discovery II </em>returned to the South Shetland Islands for two months surveying. On 6 January 1937 Ommanney went ashore to collect rock and other specimens on King George Island with five other men who were to survey Esther Harbour near North Foreland. Over the next ten days they were marooned on the island, first in a drifting motorboat (which later sank) and then at a makeshift camp ashore. On her return from the southern coast  <em>Discovery II </em>found the men's base deserted and radioed for help. The party's rescue by  <em>Discovery II </em>after ten days on the island was another episode recorded in  <em>South Latitude. Discovery II </em>'s men <em> </em>did further surveying and scientific work in the South Shetland and South Orkney Islands, landing in Scotia Bay, Laurie Island, on 6 February 1937. The ship did additional work between South Georgia and the Falkland Island before she left for England, via Cape Town.</p><p>Ommanney worked again at the British Museum (Natural History), London, from 1937 until World War II broke out, when he returned to Antarctica as a whaling inspector on a factory ship. In England in May 1940 he joined the RNVR as a meteorological officer, and saw action in the Mediterranean and North Atlantic. He was at the Mauritius-Seychelles Fisheries Survey 1947-49, worked in Zanzibar and Singapore during six years with the Colonial Research Services, and was reader in marine biology at the University of Hong Kong 1957-60. During most of his postings, starting with South Georgia, he produced readable travel books recounting his experiences, among them:  <em>South Latitude (1938), North Cape (1939), The Shoals of Capricorn (1952), Isle of Cloves (1955)  </em>and <em>Eastern Windows (1960), </em></p><p>Ommanney received the Polar Medal in Bronze in 1942; he had not wintered on the Antarctic mainland, a requirement at the time for its award in Silver. As a relatively young man he wrote, 'I am no sailor and it looks as though I never shall be. I have not the salt in my blood perhaps, and I lack altogether the patience, resourcefulness and cheerful fatalism of the sailor' ( <em>South Latitude </em>p 156). He died on 30 June 1980. Ommanney was a private and intensely shy man, by his own account occasionally provoked to wit or tactlessness, and an engaging writer. He did not marry.</p><p>Ommanney Bay (60°33'S, 45°32'W) between Prong Point and Foul Point on the north coast of Coronation Island, South Orkney Islands, was named after him in 1933 and is now included in Antarctic Specially Protected Area no. 114. The Ommanney Glacier in northern Victoria Land was named not for FD Ommanney but for Admiral Sir Erasmus Ommanney, 1814-1904.</p>",

        "body": " <p>naval officer, was born in 1785, the second surviving son of Admiral Sir Richard Onslow, bart and Anne, née Mitchell. He entered the Royal Navy at the relatively late age of 25 and served in the captured French vessel <em>Surveillante </em>, distinguishing himself during the Peninsula War in several landings on the north coast of Spain. He then joined the <em>Montagu  </em>(74 guns) which was engaged in the war with the United States and remained in South American waters until 1818. He was promoted lieutenant in 1816 and served on the <em>Conqueror </em>(74 guns) based at the Cape of Good Hope and covering St Helena (where Napoleon was being held). He was promoted commander in 1822 and spent two years on the Jamaica station.</p><p>In 1830 he was appointed to command HMS <em>Clio </em>(16 guns) on the South American station. In 1832, acting on the instructions of the Foreign Secretary Lord Palmerston, Admiral Sir Thomas Baker, in command at Río, instructed Onslow to sail to the Falkland Islands to reassert British sovereignty. Onslow arrived at Port Egmont in West Falkland on 20 December and found the remains of the British settlement there unoccupied. After sending his boats to explore the neighbouring waters, he sailed for Berkeley Sound on East Falkland, arriving at Port Louis on 2 January 1833. Here he found a Buenos Airean schooner the <em>Sarandi </em>anchored off <a href=\"/biographies/vernet_louis\">VERNET</a>'s damaged settlement. A civilised confrontation with the Argentine captain, Pinedo, followed:</p><blockquote><blockquote>I waited upon the commander of the schooner. He informed me he commanded both afloat and ashore. I acquainted him civilly with the object of my mission and requested him to embark his force and haul down his flag on shore, he being in a possession belonging to the Crown of Great Britain. At first he acquiesced, providing I put the same in writing, which I did. [The following day finding that the schooner's captain]  wavered and was reluctant to strike the flag, I immediately landed, hoisted the Union and caused it [the Buenos Airean flag] to be lowered, sending it with a civil message to the schooner.</blockquote></blockquote><p>Onslow instructed the Argentine garrison, which had arrived with <a href=\"/biographies/mestivier_joseph\">MESTIVIER</a> just three months earlier, to leave, but urged the handful of genuine residents to remain, as most of them did. The <em>Sarandi </em>sailed and Onslow remained at Port Louis for ten days, entrusting the senior British resident, William <a href=\"/biographies/dickson_william\">DICKSON</a>, with the hoisting of the Union flag on the flag pole which the Clios had erected. He concluded his report with an optimistic assessment of the Falkland Islands, recommending that a small force be stationed there and that naval ships visit frequently.</p><p>In June 1833 Onslow returned to Portsmouth and on 17 June was paid off. In 1834 he was promoted Captain, but he remained on half pay until 1842. In 1840 and 1841 he wrote to the Colonial Office supporting plans for colonising the Islands and offering to become governor; but the post went to Lt <a href=\"/biographies/moody_richard\">MOODY</a> of the Royal Engineers. In a letter to the Admiralty dated 4 May 1842 he applied for a command and claimed that: 'I was selected for a most delicate service, \"the re-taking of the Falkland Islands\", a service which Wm 4 [King William IV] and Sir T Hardy were pleased to say had been performed with great judgement'. Whether because of this plea or not, in July 1842 Onslow was appointed to command the 18 gun corvette HMS <em>Daphne </em>in the Pacific. During this tour he called at the Islands from 22 April to 4 May 1844. He returned to England early in 1847 and was retired.</p><p>Onslow was married and had four sons all of whom joined the navy or the Royal Marines. Only the eldest, William Lake Onslow, who later took holy orders, survived his father. Onslow died in 1856. He did not enjoy a brilliant career by the standards of his very naval family, but he handled the recovery of the Falkland Islands in 1833 firmly and with tact.</p>",

        "body": " <p>doctor, minister and baron, was born in Plympton, Devon on 2 July 1938, son of Dr John William Morris Owen and Mary, née Llewellyn. Educated at Bradfield College, Sidney Sussex College Cambridge and St Thomas's Hospital London, he practised medicine. In 1968 he married Deborah Schabert; they have three children. Elected Labour MP for Plymouth in 1966, he held several junior ministerial posts in the Wilson and Callaghan governments of the 1970s. He was serving as minister of state in the FCO (appointed in 1976) when Anthony Crosland, secretary of state for foreign and commonwealth affairs, died in February 1977. Owen succeeded Crosland.</p><p><strong>Foreign Secretary - the Falklands</strong></p><p>One of Crosland's last acts as foreign secretary had been to make a statement in the Commons on Lord SHACKLETON's report on 2 February 1977. Crosland said that 'in any major developments of the Islands' economy, especially those relating to offshore resources, co-operation with Argentina - even participation, should, if possible, be secured'. He was willing to spend some money on relatively minor schemes and improvements to the infrastructure but not on the recommended extension to the airfield runway when there were 'more urgent claims from much poorer countries. And the right political circumstances do not exist'.</p><p>In relation to Argentina, Crosland concluded that 'the time has come to consult both with the Islanders and with the Argentine Government whether a climate exists for discussing the broad issues which bear on the future of the Falkland Islands, and the possibilities of cooperation between Britain and Argentina in the region of the South-West Atlantic'. He emphasised that the 'sovereignty umbrella' * must apply and that changes must be acceptable to Islanders 'whose interests and well-being remain our prime concern'. He announced that he was sending Ted <a href=\"/biographies/rowlands_edward\">ROWLANDS</a>, minister of state, to hold discussions in the Falklands and Argentina.</p><p>The situation, as Rowlands set out, was tense. On 20 December 1976 a helicopter from HMS <em>Endurance </em>had discovered an Argentine military presence on Southern Thule, one of the South Sandwich Islands. The Argentine response to British protests claimed that its purpose was to establish a scientific station but expressed the hope that nothing would cloud the 'auspicious perspectives' for negotiation. Information had been received about Argentine naval contingency planning for the occupation of the Falklands. On 4 February the unarmed survey ship RRS <em>Shackleton </em>, (Captain <a href=\"/biographies/warne_philip\">WARNE)</a>, had been fired on by an Argentine destroyer which had attempted, unsuccessfully, to arrest her 78 miles off Stanley.</p><p>Owen tells in his memoirs <em>Time to Declare </em>(1991) how serious consideration was given to diverting a Royal Navy task group, which included a nuclear submarine, to the South Atlantic if developments during Rowlands' visit warranted it. This was not in the event deemed necessary since Rowlands' discussions, in which he chose not to make a great issue of Southern Thule, went well. But it was a precedent for the deployment by Owen and Callaghan of a Royal Navy task force in the following November (which was to be significant later in considering whether the Conservative government had done sufficient to deter the 1982 invasion).</p><p>On 1 March there was a Foreign Affairs debate in the Commons in which both Owen and Rowlands spoke. Owen reaffirmed the pledges made by Crosland, including the fact that any negotiations would take place under the sovereignty umbrella*. He said 'there has been and there will be no sell-out' and that 'any change in the sovereignty would have to come before this house'. Rowlands was able to report that the Island councils supported HMG's intention to try to establish a basis for negotiations with Argentina. His talks in Buenos Aires had led him to the view that 'we shall be able to make progress towards a possible agreement on future negotiations'. No mention was made of Southern Thule which was not to be public knowledge till the following year. Rowlands repeated Owen's assurances.</p><p>On 26 April 1977 Owen was able to announce in the Commons that the British and Argentine Governments had agreed to hold negotiations in June or July 1977. They would concern 'future political relations, including sovereignty... and economic co-operation ....The issues affecting the future of the Islands will be discussed and negotiations will be directed to the working out of a peaceful solution...' The major objective would be 'to achieve a stable, prosperous and politically durable future for the Islands'. The agreement also incorporated a commitment to consult the Islanders and the assurance of the sovereignty umbrella in the negotiations.</p><p>Prior to the negotiations, Owen presented a paper to the Cabinet's Defence Committee which argued for keeping the Argentines in play, bearing in mind that the Islands were indefensible. The Committee felt that in the end some form of leaseback was the only formula likely to satisfy Argentina. The aim was to retain British sovereignty as long as possible while educating UK and Island opinion. Having agreed to talk, Owen wanted to play it long, postponing any ministerial meeting to the year end. He disliked doing business with a country with such a poor human rights record. The first round of talks in Rome in July 1977, held at official level, progressed little beyond the restatement of positions.</p><p><strong>Argentine Pressure</strong></p><p>The period from July to December 1977 saw a steady increase in Argentine militancy, which doubtless reflected their view that Britain was playing for time. There was the arrest by Argentine naval vessels of Soviet and Bulgarian fishing vessels in Falklands waters with carefully publicised threats to sink other vessels in similar circumstances. There was the continuing occupation and duplicity over Southern Thule (which the Argentines had said they were abandoning but to which they returned in October 1977). A Joint Intelligence Committee study which Owen had especially requested at that time assessed that if Argentina concluded that negotiations had broken down or there appeared to be no real prospect of progress towards a negotiated transfer of sovereignty there was high risk of more forceful measures including direct military action. An invasion was unlikely but could not be discounted; an adventurist operation was always possible.</p><p>Owen was concerned that in the face of the hardening Argentine position the FCO appeared disposed to concede too much on sovereignty and he decided that 'we should work towards the solution of a leaseback of the inhabited islands for a period of 70 years and certainly not less than 50 years.' Owen had also become concerned at reports from the Falklands that Islanders thought HMG was talking behind their backs and minuted 'I am not prepared to move behind their backs. We will, at all times, operate straightforwardly'. There was always tension between the FCO official view that a crisis was best averted by a change of tack in negotiations and the Callaghan view, shared by Owen, that threatening behaviour was best met by demonstrating a will to resist, most notably by the deployment of ships.</p><p><strong>HMS <em>Endurance </em>and the Naval Task Force </strong></p><p>When Rowlands had gone to Argentina in February, a Royal Navy task force, including a nuclear-powered submarine, had been put on standby, albeit a thousand miles away. Now it was decided that a military presence in the area of the Falklands should be established by the beginning of the next round of negotiations in December.</p><p>In the same spirit Owen had attached a great deal of importance to the retention of HMS <em>Endurance </em>, the patrol ship which visited the South Atlantic every austral summer, described by Callaghan as 'a visible symbol of the latent power of the Royal Navy and of Britain's determination'. The issue of her possible withdrawal went back to the 1974 Defence Review and had been debated every year since. On 25 April 1977 Owen wrote to the secretary of defence, Fred Mulley, saying that HMS <em>Endurance </em>should be retained. Her withdrawal would undermine the confidence of Islanders and encourage Argentina to think that Britain was withdrawing from the South-West Atlantic. Mulley agreed to her deployment for 1977/78, which continued till 1981/82 when the Conservative government agreed to her withdrawal. This was to be challenged by Callaghan in the Commons shortly before the invasion as 'an error that could have serious consequences'.</p><p>The December 1977 deployment was to be the subject of substantial debate at the time of the 1982 invasion when it was revealed by Callaghan in the Commons on 30 March and in the context of the Franks Report when it was debated in January 1983. Franks says that the decision was taken in the light of the intelligence assessment at a meeting on 21 November 1977 (between Prime Minister Callaghan, Owen, the defence secretary and the chief of the defence staff) and that its:</p><blockquote><blockquote>objective would be to buttress the Government's negotiating position by deploying a force of sufficient strength ...to convince the Argentines that military action by them would meet resistance. The Committee agreed that secrecy should be maintained about the purpose of the force which would consist of a nuclear submarine in the immediate vicinity of the Islands and two frigates standing off a thousand miles away. Rules of engagement were drawn up.</blockquote></blockquote><p>According to Franks, Cabinet Committee papers show clearly that it was agreed that the force should remain covert and there was no evidence that the Argentine Government came to know of its existence.</p><p>Owen in <em>Time to Declare </em>is clear the deployment was covert. He criticises Franks for not having cleared up the controversy surrounding Callaghan's evidence to the Committee that he (Callaghan) had advised the head of MI6, Sir Maurice Oldfield, to inform the Argentines of the naval deployment and thereby deterred an invasion at the time. In his own memoirs <em>Time and Chance </em>, Callaghan modifies this to state that he 'informed the Head of MI6 of our plans before the ships sailed and it is possible, as I had hoped, some information reached the Argentinian armed forces'. Whatever the precise way in which Callaghan went about imparting the information, Owen does not think that Oldfield would have acted on Callaghan's instructions without reference to Owen to whom he was primarily answerable. This undermines the argument that the deployment deterred the Argentines, but in the Franks Debate Owen, reiterating his view that the Argentines did not know, said 'the real significance of deploying a nuclear-powered submarine below the surface (was) ... to be in a position to intervene if matters deteriorated'. Owen also thought the deployment might need to be repeated and was pleased that the naval personnel had kept news of the deployment secret.</p><p>The December negotiations took place in New York and were conducted by Rowlands and Captain Allara, the Argentine deputy foreign minister. The Argentines predictably presumed that the talks would deal with stages in the transfer of sovereignty while Rowlands emphasised the need to search for compromise. To this end he was willing to draw a distinction between inhabited and uninhabited territories. There might be willingness to contemplate a change in the sovereignty position of the Dependencies though not in the status of the Falklands. This concession avoided the necessity of discussing leaseback to which Islanders were reported to be implacably opposed. Agreement was reached on the creation of two Anglo-Argentine working groups to discuss economic cooperation and sovereignty issues. Rowlands subsequently briefed Islands councillors on what had transpired in Río de Janeiro and they raised no objections.</p><p>The first meetings of the working groups took place early in 1978 in Lima. They ran into the immediate problem that the Argentines' claim that the Falklands and their Dependencies did not generate a continental shelf and that the shelf rights belonged to Argentina. This was relevant to the Argentine dispute with Chile over islands in the Beagle Channel with which they were for the time being more preoccupied than the Falklands. It was agreed that the Argentines should explain their position further, which brought a respite, as did the holding of the World Cup in Argentina and their desire to avoid international embarrassment at that time.</p><p>Throughout 1978, the British Government continued to be troubled by the unsolved problem of Southern Thule, the resolution of which was the particular responsibility of Rowlands, whose last appearance as a negotiator was in Geneva in December 1978.</p><p>A further meeting was held at the end of March in New York but little substantial progress was made. The British Government's electoral position was looking increasingly perilous and Owen had warned Argentina that there could be no movement before an election. Owen's view was that HMG's negotiating position was already at least five years ahead of public opinion both in Britain and the Falklands. Owen's concerns in 1978 were largely about military options. He worried about the Falklands' vulnerability if the Argentines were to react suddenly to further lack of progress in negotiations and the continuing need to reassure Islanders. The Ministry of Defence, nervous about military confrontation with Argentina, were also reluctant to deploy ships for operational and cost reasons, especially for the fishery patrols which might be needed if there was to be economic collaboration in this area. Throughout Owen continued to take a special interest in the deployment of HMS <em>Endurance </em>. The Callaghan government resigned after the general election of 3 May 1979.</p><p><strong>Opposition, 1982 and after</strong></p><p>In opposition, Owen drifted away from the Labour Party and became a founder of the SDP in 1981. He led the SDP from 1983-7. Before he had become leader of the SDP Owen was praised for his speech in the Commons debate on the Franks Report on 25 January 1983. Making the point at the start that 'there but for the grace of God go I', he went on to criticise both the prime minister, Mrs Thatcher and foreign secretary, Lord Carrington for the government's failure to react to intelligence of an impending invasion by a naval deployment, especially a nuclear-powered submarine. He criticised Mrs Thatcher for her posture after the war: 'Not one millimetre of magnanimity nor one centimetre of sensitivity has come from her'. He went on to say: 'It is a fool who believes that we shall be able to withstand the present stance of no negotiations, Fortress Falklands and paramountcy for Falkland Islanders'. In reply to a question by the prime minister, he denied ever having used the word 'paramountcy' in his own statements on the Falklands as foreign secretary, always as he said, talking of the best interests or the long-term interests of the Falkland Islanders. His view was Britain should be prepared to discuss sovereignty and that ultimately it would be a question for the House of Commons to decide.</p><p>From 1992-5 he served as co-chairman of the International Conference on former Yugoslavia. In 1976 he was appointed privy counsellor; he was created baron in 1992; he became a Companion of Honour in 1994.</p>",

        "body": " <p>soldier and colonist, was born in Buenos Aires on 25 April 1761. At twenty, he began a military career as a second lieutenant in the cavalry taking part in several campaigns against the Indians. In 1799 he is known to have been a captain based in Montevideo and fighting the Churrua Indians. Pacheco supported the Revolution of May in 1810 as a captain of militia. But as a result of all his activities he became impoverished, with the newly independent Buenos Aires government owing him about 100,000 pesos. It could not pay this.</p><p>In 1819, Pacheco was introduced to Louis <a href=\"/biographies/vernet_louis\">VERNET</a>, who began to lend him money. By 1821, Vernet had lent him a total of 2,000 pesos, so on 11 April, Vernet formally agreed to support him financially until he could collect what government owed him, half of which would then belong to Vernet. This association between Pacheco and Vernet was to lead to Vernet's life's work in the Falklands. Pacheco was married to Dionisia Obes, sister-in-law of Bernardo <a href=\"/biographies/bonavia_bernardo\">BONAVÍA</a>, who had commanded the Spanish garrison on the Falklands on several occasions. Through them, Pacheco and Vernet learned of all the wild cattle in the Falklands - and Vernet was in the business of slaughtering wild cattle for hides.</p><p>When it appeared that Pacheco would never get any money from the Buenos Aires government, he, with Vernet's close collaboration, petitioned for the right to slaughter the wild cattle and seals on East Falkland, as a business speculation, to rescue himself from poverty and give his six children a future. Pacheco made this petition on 23 August 1823 and the Buenos Aires government granted it to Pacheco on 28 August. The very next day, Pacheco did a business deal with a British immigrant Robert <a href=\"/biographies/schofield_robert\">SCHOFIELD</a>, who was to manage, more accurately mismanage, the expedition to the Falklands.</p><p>On the 18 December 1823, when the expedition was about to sail, Pacheco petitioned for an actual grant of land on East Falkland on which to raise sheep, and for a retired militia officer, Pablo Areguati, whom the expedition had engaged, to be granted the title of commander of East Falkland. This position was to be without salary, but would enable him to form a militia from the expedition's men, and thus get respect from the workers themselves and the captains of visiting ships. Areguati was of Guarani Indian orirgin, from a settlement protected and educated by the Jesuits (until their expulsion for helping the Indians in 1767). He was made 'mayor' of the settlement of Manisovi, in what is now the province of Entre Rios and appointed a militia officer by General Belgrano in 1811 during local warfare with Paraguay. Pacheco also requested cannon, so the expedition could defend itself against pirates.</p><p>The grant of land was made the same day - subject to a proper survey of the land concerned. It was later (in January 1828) specified as three parcels, each of ten square leagues. But the request to make Areguati a 'commander' was not granted, nor were cannon supplied. Despite this, Argentine myth-makers have transformed this petition and its unsatisfactory reply into the appointment of Areguati as governor of the Falklands. Mario Tesler, Argentina's leading historian on the Falklands, included Areguati in an article in the newspaper <em>Clarin </em>entitled: '<em>Gobernadores Que Nunca Fueron </em>' (the governors who never were). This clearly states that Areguati's appointment was only requested, but not granted.</p><p>The 1824 expedition was a disaster. One ship, the <em>Rafaela </em>, left Buenos Aires towards the end of December, equipped to go sealing. It was never heard of again. A second ship, the <em>Fenwick </em>, arrived in the Falklands on 2 February 1824. This had Areguati on board. His letter dated 12 February to Pacheco described their difficulties. Only five thin horses had survived the voyage, and these could not cope with the difficult ground. The expedition had no gunpowder with which to hunt, and were living off rabbits they had caught. Schofield followed in March, but turned to drink. The expedition collapsed after a few months and everyone lost their investment. In August of 1824, the last of the expedition got back to Buenos Aires and were paid off. As Pacheco had no money, Vernet had to assume his portion of the loss.</p><p>To recover this lost investment, Louis Vernet launched another business association to exploit the seals and cattle on East Falkland. For this, Pacheco ceded the rest of the use of East Falkland granted to him in August 1823 to this new association (Vernet considered that half of this had belonged to him from the very beginning). The contract was dated 31 December 1825.</p><p>After many difficulties, Vernet established a tiny working settlement in the Falklands. He obtained the grant of almost all of East Falkland in January 1828, and via a complex deal took over the rest of Pacheco's 30 square leagues then too. Despite the difficulties which Vernet's association with Pacheco had caused, they remained good friends until the very end, with Vernet even looking after him on his deathbed.</p><p>Writing to his friend Krumbhaar on 27 December 1832, Vernet said: 'my worthy old friend Dn Jorge Pacheco is ill ... and now takes up all my attention'. Adding to the same letter on 7 January, Vernet wrote:</p><blockquote><blockquote>My friend Don Jorge Pacheco expired on the 5th instant aged 73 years much lamented and respected by his numerous friends. It was for the important services which he had rendered the country that he obtained in 1823 the first grant of cattle and some lands on East Falkland Island in which I was concerned one half in consideration of having supported his family from 1819 until 1823 (He was not concerned in the grant of 1828). He was a much respected military officer during the greater part of his life, and latterly a member of the house of representatives.</blockquote></blockquote><p>No information is available on Pacheco's service in the House of Representatives, which Argentine historians appear to be unaware of - or at least never mention. But there is no reason to doubt Vernet on this. In an account written in April 1837, Vernet stated that Pacheco acknowledged owing him 7,000 pesos in his will. So we can assume that Pacheco never got any financial benefit at all from the Falklands enterprise. He never went there, nor did he hold any official position there.</p>",

        "body": " <p>landowner, was probably born in 1824. He was one of the sons of Colonel Henry Packe of Twyford Hall, Twyford near Reepham, Norfolk. His father was the principal landowner in this small parish which in 1841 consisted of 529 acres and 94 souls. Twyford Hall was described in 1845 as 'a neat mansion in pleasant grounds'. Nothing is known of Packe's schooling. His father bought him a commission in the 34th Regiment of Foot and he was commissioned as an ensign on 1 June 1841. He was promoted to lieutenant on 13 December 1843 and later rose to the rank of captain. He retained this title after leaving the Army in 1851.</p><p>His resignation was to enable him to start a new business career in the Falklands. He had become interested in the Falklands in 1848 when his cousin Philip Hamond told him about his experiences sailing round the islands with Captain BJ <a href=\"/biographies/sulivan_sir\">SULIVAN</a>. Packe's conviction that the Falklands offered him an opportunity for a new career was reinforced by a long article about the Islands in Cockburn's  <em>New Monthly Magazine  </em>for November <em> </em>1849 <em>.  </em></p><p>The Falklands shipping register recorded the arrival of the 450 ton barque  <em>Lalla Rookh  </em>on 11 May 1851: ' With Capt. Packe and stores for Capt. Sulivan, 89 days out' from London. His own supplies followed him out in the barque  <em>Augusta  </em>which arrived on 19 August of the same year. On arrival Packe immediately sought to acquire land from the government initially with leases on East Falkland - Fitzroy and Port Louis. He and his brother Edward who arrived in 1866 ultimately extended their holdings to 105,000 acres. They also created a substantial holding on West Falkland in three separate sites at Port Howard, Fox Bay East and Dunnose Head, totalling 118,000 acres. Robert Packe's principal contribution to the economy of the Islands was the introduction of large-scale sheep farming. By 1861, he was asking for government assistance under the Colonial Land and Emigration Commissioner's Land order system to import two shepherds and their families from the United Kingdom. By the 1870s sheep had been become the major agricultural activity in the islands.</p><p>Packe was also involved in cattle farming and in the capture and slaughter of wild cattle. The latter also provided a ready income from the sale of their hides and their meat. Fresh beef was always in demand from ships calling at Stanley. The ownership of the wild cattle had been a vexed question between successive Governors and their lessees. In 1860, the Privy Council ruled they were  <em>ferae naturae  </em>and that the lessees had the right to dispose of the cattle without having to seek permission or pay a royalty to the Governor. Packe among others was entitled to compensation for the fines and royalties he had paid since the Governor had resumed authority over these cattle. In 1861, he claimed £637 for the 23 cattle he had killed plus those killed by one of the <a href=\"/biographies/the_pitaluga\">PITALUGA</a> family on his leaseholds. He also submitted a claim for a further £1200 for 'having suffered great loss from having his tame herds and flocks decoyed away into the mountains, and likewise been deprived of the value of hides of many hundreds of these animals which he certainly should have destroyed'. There were other clashes with various Governors on land-holding matters and also with the Falkland Islands Company. In 1862, for example, Packe took two Falkland Island Company employees to court for damage to his land by the company practice of firing their own grasslands which bounded Packe's holdings.</p><p>Packe lived at Sulivan House, Stanley. In 1872 he bought the barque  <em>Jhelum  </em>as a storage depot and workshop, had her beached outside his house at the upper end of the harbour. This vessel had entered Stanley in distress in 1869 and was finally condemned as unseaworthy in 1871. He also ran a cutter to deliver supplies and collect fleeces and hides from his outlying holdings. In June 1871 he offered to sell his 16 ton cutter  <em>Exe </em>(built in 1868 at Exmouth) to the Falkland Islands Government as pilot boat for Stanley Harbour for £300.</p><p>Packe was also part of the tiny group of 'socially elite' in Falklands Society. As such, he played a part in the government of the Islands and was a member of the LegCo and a magistrate.

He qualified as a lawyer in 1900, but his thesis on <em>La Miseria en la Republica Argentina </em>(Poverty in the Argentine Republic) was rejected because of the strongly polemical tone of his socialist analysis. He entered politics the following year and in 1904 he was elected deputy, the first socialist deputy in America.</p><p>During his long life, he occupied various university professorships in philosophy, law and related subjects and held seats in the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate. His political activity saw him serve a prison sentence and exile in Uruguay, (where he was later ambassador). In his intellectual work, he produced many books, such as <em>El Nuevo Derecho </em>(New Law), <em>Universidad y Democracia </em>(University and Democracy), and <em>La Fatiga en el Trabajo </em>(Fatigue at Work). In these and in his political activities he put forward the need for socialism with national roots. As a legislator, he was responsible for sixty laws with social content, such as confirming Sunday as a day of rest from work, or regulating working conditions for children and women. He enjoyed international fame, being designated <em>Maestro de America </em>(Master of America) shortly before his death.</p><p>He took part in very diverse activities, being one of the first Argentines to make a trip in a balloon. At the same time as he enjoyed general respect, he was a flamboyant character, with a large moustache and dressing in a distinctive gaucho fashion with a poncho and large hat.</p><p>Palacios attached great importance to the subject of the sovereignty of the Falklands. In 1934, he published <em>Las islas Malvinas, un archipelago argentino </em>(The Falkland Islands, an Argentine Archipelago), which has gone through various editions, and which is a good résumé - for its time - of the historical and legal aspects. Before this he had had <em>Las Islas Malvinas </em>, a serious historical and legal study by the Franco-Argentine expert Paul <a href=\"/biographies/groussac_francois\">GROUSSAC</a>, re-edited. In 1939, with a group of intellectuals, he founded the <em>Junta pro Recuperacion de las Malvinas </em>(Committee for the Recovery of the Falklands), which had an important role, making presentations to the authorities and to international bodies. He carried out many public functions to influence the public conscience and, by means of a competition, created the <em>Malvinas March </em>, with music by José Tieri and lyrics by the well known poet Carlos Obligado, which is still used today. The Committee was replaced by the present <em>Instituto de las Malvinas y Tierras Australes Argentinas </em>(Institute of the Falklands and Southern Argentine Lands) which is a private body, all involved doing so academically.</p><p><a href=\"/biographies/roberts_david\">See Image 278</a></p>",

        "body": "<p>diplomat, was born on 14 September 1796, the eldest son of Woodbine Parish and Elizabeth Headley. He received his first appointment in the public service in 1812. His career as a diplomat began when he was sent to Sicily in 1814. In the next few years he served in Naples, Paris, the Ionian Islands and was private secretary to Lord Castlereagh. He married in 1819 Amelia Jane Morse, by whom he had eight children.</p><p>In 1823, when the British Government decided to send out political agents to the newly independent South American states, Parish was appointed HM Consul-General in Buenos Aires. With his wife and two children, he arrived there at the end of March 1824 to a great welcome from the local government as the first official emissary of any European country. Among his most urgent tasks was to negotiate with the government of Buenos Aires for the inauguration of the monthly service of British mail packets from Falmouth. The <em>Countess of Chichester </em>packet arrived only a few days later on 16 April. In February 1825, on behalf of HM government, he concluded a 'Treaty of Amity, Navigation and Commerce' with the Buenos Aires government which was to have lasting and beneficial consequences for the British residents there.</p><p>Parish became aware of official Argentine pretensions to the Falklands in March 1829 when the subject of a possible prison settlement there was mentioned in the Buenos Aires press, during the chaotic and brief revolutionary government of General Juan Lavalle. Parish promptly brought the importance of the Falklands and Britain's ancient claim to them to the attention of the British Government. Parish soon arranged a meeting with Louis Vernet, who had started his settlement there three years earlier, informed him of Britain's claim to the Islands and, on 25 April 1829, reported back to the British Government that he believed Vernet would '<em>be very happy if His Majesty's Government would take his settlement under their protection' </em>.</p><p>A few weeks later, on 10 June, the Lavalle Government claimed Argentine sovereignty over the Falklands, by inheritance from Spain, and appointed Vernet honorary civil and military commandant of his own tiny settlement. Parish was instructed to protest against this. He did so in November of that same year, saying the decree was an unfriendly act, and declaring that the Islands belonged to Britain. His note of protest was acknowledged, but never received a reply.</p><p>Parish encouraged Vernet to keep in communication with him, and Vernet did so hoping Parish could induce British settlers and shipping to come to the Falklands. In fact, just a few days after the Argentine decree claiming the Falklands on 10 June, Vernet wrote to Parish suggesting the flotation of a British company to exploit his business there, and invited Parish to invest in this himself but Parish turned this down. In 1830, when Vernet had published a circular letter warning foreign sealing vessels to cease their activities in the Falklands, Parish reminded him of Britain's rights there, and not to interfere with British vessels. Parish was in Buenos Aires in November 1831 when Vernet brought a captured American sealing vessel to that city with its crew for trial. The capture of this ship and two others provoked an attack by the USS Lexington, Captain <a href=\"/biographies/duncan_silas\">DUNCAN</a>, which destroyed Vernet's settlement in the Falklands.</p><p>Early in 1832, Parish left Buenos Aires with his family after a distinguished career recognised by honours accorded him by the Buenos Aires Government. He left bearing maps of the Falklands given to him by Vernet and a report from Vernet on conditions there. Passing through Montevideo on his way home, Parish witnessed the return of the <em>Lexington </em>to the River Plate - with nearly all Vernet's colonists on board. He then proceeded on to Britain, and his reports on this incident may well have influenced the British Government in its subsequent decision to enforce its claim to sovereignty.</p><p>In 1835, his wife Amelia died, and in 1844 he was married for the second time to Louisa Ann Hubbard, by whom he had a further five children. Parish had combined with his political labours much scientific research, chiefly in geology and palaeontology. In 1824 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. In 1837, in recognition of all his achievements William IV conferred on him the rank of Knight Commander of the Royal Guelphic Order of Hanover. In 1839, his account of the years he spent in South America was published under the title <em>Buenos Ayres and the Provinces of the Río de la Plata .... </em>, and a second edition came out in 1852.</p><p>In 1840, Parish was appointed chief commissioner to settle British claims on the Neapolitan Government in consequence of the sulphur monopoly. At the successful conclusion of the dispute in 1842, he was appointed joint plenipotentiary minister at Naples to conclude a commercial treaty with the king. This task completed he returned home to England in 1845. He died at St Leonards-on-Sea, Sussex, on 16 August 1882.</p><p>Although he never visited the Falkland Islands, he was quick to alert the British Government to the implications of events in the South Atlantic in the years before the British re-occupation of the Islands.</p>",

        "body": "<p>governor, was born in London on 20 December 1919, the son of Alexander Roland Parker, an official at the Post Office and his wife Annie Jane Louise, née Morris. Parker entered the Ministry of Labour in 1938, but served in the army during World War II, being with the London Scottish in 1940 and 1941. During the war, in 1941, he married Deidre Mary Ward. After the war he returned to the Ministry of Labour, minus half a leg as a result of a war injury. Thanks to the good efforts of the Roehampton Limb-Fitting Centre this never adversely affected his future career and in 1957 he was posted to the Embassy in Tel Aviv (Israel) as labour attaché. Two further labour attaché posts followed in Ghana and Nigeria, and in 1965 Parker was seconded to the Foreign Office and served in London. In 1966 he went to Enugu in Eastern Nigeria as deputy high commissioner (effectively a consul-general), during which time the east - as Biafra - broke away from the Nigerian federation resulting in civil war. Having managed successfully to evacuate his staff and other expatriates, he returned to London in 1967. From 1971 to 1972 he was head of chancery in Suva (Fiji) and from 1972-1975 he was British high commissioner in the Gambia. He was posted to Durban in South Africa as consul general in 1976, but posted again in the same year to Stanley on the early departure of Governor <a href=\"/biographies/french_neville\">FRENCH</a>. He arrived in Stanley on 16 December 1976.</p><p>Parker was governor and commander in chief of the Falkland Islands and High Commissioner for the British Antarctic Territories, and he took over at a time when Argentine pressure on the Islands was steadily increasing. Lord SHACKLETON's report had just been delivered and it became clear that his first priority was to implement those parts of it which the government in London was prepared to fund. Shackleton's recommendations were not universally popular and making progress on them required determination and persistence. Parker managed to persuade the members of both Councils to support Shackleton's ideas and by the time his successor, Rex <a href=\"/biographies/hunt_sir\">HUNT</a>, was appointed the first step in land distribution, the Green Patch Scheme was ready to be implemented. The Falkland Islands Company agreed to sell its farm at Green Patch to government which in turn would divide it and sell it on at subsidised terms to six farmers.</p><p>Parker's next priority was the government air service (FIGAS). When he arrived, both the Beaver seaplanes were unserviceable and morale in FIGAS and the settlements which depended on it was low. He succeeded in getting the two Beavers back in service and then set about convincing London that a land-based service was required. It was not a promising time to promote a major policy change, which implied not just the purchase of new aircraft, but investment in landing strips across the Islands, the provision of a new hangar at Stanley and additional training. But the Britten-Norman Islander was obtained for FIGAS and has been in service successfully ever since, with the exception of the 1982 conflict.</p><p>Two licences were issued to oil-companies to carry out a survey of oil resources. But the search for oil, like a possible fisheries regime, aroused concern in London because of the likely Argentine reaction. Parker worked hard to maintain cordial relations with the captains of the fish factory ships which called at the Islands and who were very conscious that they were fortunate not to be paying for permission to fish around the Falklands.</p><p>The Shackleton Report had laid stress on krill resources, but during Parker's time most of the fishing was for fin-fish for sale in Scandinavia. However at the end of his tour there was a large catch of small squid which found a ready market in Japan and this was the forerunner of the present flourishing industry. Kelp was another potential resource in which Parker took an interest, but the expense of drying harvested kelp rendered it uneconomic in the Falklands.</p><p>Argentine pressure on the Islands was a constant theme of his term in Stanley. The Argentine station illegally planted on Southern Thule in the South Sandwich islands was discovered in the last days of 1976 and became an additional issue in Anglo-Argentine relations. Most of the time these were handled by the minister of state, Ted <a href=\"/biographies/rowlands_edward\">ROWLANDS</a>, who made numerous visits to Stanley and Buenos Aires. Parker had to warn him on occasions that the proposal of 'lease-back' (a transfer of sovereignty to Argentina, followed by a lease of the Islands back to the UK) would simply not be acceptable to councillors.</p><p>The Islands were only defended by a small group of Royal Marines and the FIDF, with back up from HMS <em>Endurance </em>during the summer season. So when Parker became aware of intelligence reports of an Argentine threat, he requested urgent support from London in a telegram which was seen by Prime Minister James <a href=\"/biographies/callaghan_leonard\">CALLAGHAN</a>. A task force was assembled, including a nuclear submarine, and the Argentines backed off. In spite of the underlying problems, Parker had reasonably cordial relations with the few Argentine officials in Stanley at the time who were mainly involved in commercial links such as the air service to the mainland and the supply of gasoline.</p><p>Tourism was a subject which Parker promoted: he encouraged the Hon Lucinda Buxton of Survival Anglia to visit the Islands to make a television documentary, a film and a book and these served to encourage tourists in the years after the 1982 conflict. Lucinda's father, Lord Buxton, of Anglia Television, proved a strong ally of the Falklands in those difficult years.</p><p>As governor, Parker was also high commissioner for the British Antarctic Territories and he described his annual visits to the Antarctic bases and South Georgia as 'one of the main blessings of the job'. He was very aware of the Argentine threat on the one hand and - on the other - of constant pressure from London to reduce expenditure on the British Antarctic Survey and he did his best to give the Survey all the support he could.</p><p>As a former labour attaché, Parker was particularly  pleased to recommend a minimum wage for farm and public sector workers. Employment conditions on some farms still verged on the feudal and with his experience he took a great interest in labour relations and was able to give very useful guidance.</p><p>The Parkers left the Islands on 31 January 1980, and he retired from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office shortly thereafter to take up residence in the West Country. Deidre Parker died in 2001.</p>",

He was educated at the Government School in Stanley. His early years were spent jobbing around East Falkland with his brothers Jim and Andrew, undertaking major projects, such as work on telephone lines and cutting new vehicle tracks. This was before machinery was in general use and all heavy work was done by hand. Des Peck later composed poems and songs about those heroic days. He subsequently went to work as a foreman for PWD where he stayed until the end of World War II, when he began contract work around the farms, painting and renovating. He married Beatrice Ena Davis in St.Mary's Church, Stanley on 2 May 1935: they had two children, Burned and Leatrice .</p><p>In 1949 Des Peck started a small sub-contract workforce, helping in the construction of the Ajax Bay Refrigeration Plant. It was the savings from this contract that enabled him in 1952 to build and operate the Philomel Store adjacent to the public jetty in Stanley. His flamboyancy in operating this successful business was legendary and several budding musicians were to benefit from his love of music when he imported musical instruments and amplifiers, allowing them long term credit facilities for repayment. He did not believe in accounts or accountants. Most of his business transactions were scribbled on the back of a cigarette packet or cardboard shoebox and he would accept direct assessment for income tax. His colourful advertisements would attract much attention and discussion, but sold his goods such as Home Charm Paints, Rowntrees sweets, camping gear, fresh fruit, condoms or a reasonably priced hotel room for a stay in Montevideo. He was to continue this business for the next thirty-six years, until his death in Stanley at the age of eighty on 10 July 1988.</p><p>Without any doubt Des Peck was a colourful character and a likeable rogue. He was a very dedicated member of the Falklands Islands Defence Force and a good footballer. He played snooker and billiards to a high standard. He was an accomplished musician, who performed on piano, violin and guitar with many local bands. He liked nothing better than to organise musical concerts for radio or in public venues and singalongs in local pubs and clubs. He also composed songs and poems, which were frequently published in local periodicals. His firm and patriotic views and his prolific talent for producing verses to commemorate a wide range of public events made him something of a local poet laureate.</p><p>When a new Visitor Centre was planned at the head of the Public Jetty in Stanley in 2000, the Philomel Store building, by now a well-known landmark, was retained as part of the development by popular demand. It still serves to remind people of the distinctive voice and character of the man who held court there for so many years.</p>",

It was suggested that a small group of military pensioners from the Chelsea and Greenwich Hospitals would be ideal candidates, because they had all completed a term in the services yet would still only be middle-aged, fit for military duties and with wives who might yet be of child-bearing age. The secretary of state Lord Grey told the governor in July 1850:</p><blockquote><blockquote>The object of sending out these immigrants was to supply the Colony with a body of men, who would be capable of using arms in case of emergency, and who would, at the same time be able to live by their own industry ... in sending out this handful of men, the object is not to form a fortified post, but merely to obtain the presence of a few steady and loyal subjects trained to arms, who could suppress any sudden tumult or repel any insult from any wandering vessel.</blockquote></blockquote><p>In addition they could help to police the town, particularly at night.</p><p>A War Office <em>Memorandum of Conditions on Which it is Proposed to Enrol Pensioners for Service in the Falkland Islands 1849 </em>states that:</p><blockquote><blockquote>A maximum age of candidates should not exceed 45 years and maximum number of children not to be more than 4. Rates of pay at 1 shilling and 3 pence per day for a private, 1 shilling and 10 pence a day for a Sergeant in addition to pension, from the period they left home till embarkation. Conveyance at public expense for themselves and families to port of embarkation, free passage to the Falkland Islands, free food on board and quarter pension in advance.</blockquote></blockquote><p>Further the <em>Memorandum </em>directs that the Pensioners live in '2 roomed kit houses worth £50 each' being shipped on the same vessel and 'large barracks worth £300 capable of containing them with their families immediately on their arrival until the cottages have been put up'.</p><p>On arriving in Stanley the Pensioners would 'live in the cottages and be given allotments of 10 acres of land, and with the rights of grazing over an individual quantity of land not to exceed 100 acres.' The men themselves were under the Mutiny Act and Articles of War and were liable at all times to be called out for duty if their services were required.</p><p>A group of 30 Pensioners, many from Irish regiments, were duly recruited, and with wives and children sailed for the Falklands on board the <em>Victory, </em>a barque of 580 tons commanded by a Captain Mullens. The entire party - listed opposite - consisted of 120 people, buildings and equipment. Their period of enrolment in the Falklands was for seven years, ending in July 1856, when they were free to go elsewhere, or stay if they wished.</p><p>The <em>Victory </em>arrived in Stanley on 13 October 1849, with the addition of Captain James Reid, in charge of the party, with his family, and assisted by Sergeant-Major Henry <a href=\"/biographies/felton_henry\">FELTON</a>. A letter from Governor George <a href=\"/biographies/rennie_george\">RENNIE</a> on 2 November 1849 to Surgeon Superintendent EW Day of <em>Victory </em>reads ' I have directed Captain Reid, in the event of weather permitting, to have the whole party landed this afternoon.' Thus began the Pensioners' sojourn in the Falkland Islands.</p><p>The barracks were built, the families duly accommodated therein, until their two roomed cottages were ready. History does not relate how harmonious relations were in the barracks at this time, but with 120 men, women and children in residence, it cannot have been easy.</p><p>Unfortunately some of the men did not settle, and in 1853 thirteen of them signed a petition to be transferred to Tasmania, Australia or New Zealand, there being '....much discontent prevailing amongst them...' According to a report by Governor <a href=\"/biographies/moore_thomas\">MOORE</a> in 1857, of the original detachment of 30 Pensioners, seven had died, eleven were released from their engagement and had already left the Islands, and five wished to remain as colonists. The remaining seven left in 1858.</p><p>A complication, when trying to trace individuals, is that several extra military pensioners arrived after the original 30, confusing the numbers. Some of the families of the men stayed on; Reddie's daughter married John <a href=\"/biographies/bonner_john\">BONNER</a>. The widows of Greig, Fleming, Morris and Simpson remarried in the Falklands. Burne's widow and children are believed to have left in 1858. Adderley's wife died in 1857, when his children appear to have left.</p><p>In 1852 James Reid, the commanding officer, was transferred to Tasmania with his family, leaving Henry Felton as staff officer. A further seven Pensioners probably left in 1856 and 1857 according to the Government Land Register, which records the sales of their land and cottages. Those who stayed were Dowers, Short, Smith, Felton and Hawkins (more commonly spelt Hocking) and their descendants are still in the Islands.</p><p>The Barracks, and some Pensioners' cottages on Pioneer Row and Drury Street still stand and are used today as private residences. One cottage belongs to the Museum and National Trust and is furnished as a museum in Victorian style.</p>",

        "body": " <p>French priest and naturalist, was born in Roanne (Loire) on 13 February 1716. As a Benedictine monk, he had been attached since 1730 to the Abbey of St Maur at St Germain des Prés, then just outside Paris. When <a href=\"/biographies/bougainville_louis\">BOUGAINVILLE</a> was planning his expedition to the Falklands, Pernetty was recommended to him as chaplain by the Duc de Choiseul (the senior French statesman after whom Choiseul Sound was named), as an artist well versed in natural history, obliging, eager to please and a friend to all. Pernetty held some highly original opinions and had already published a Benedictine manual, a dictionary of painters and sculptors and a book unveiling the fables of ancient Egypt and Greece.</p><p>Pernetty's narrative of the voyage and of his stay on the Islands while the settlement of Fort St Louis (Port Louis) was being established was first published in French in Berlin in 1769, then in a much revised edition in Paris in 1770, followed by two English editions in 1771 and 1773. It is a charming and informative book, very much a personal account, enhanced with folding maps and engravings. The French title of 1770 is quite short: <em>Histoire d' un voyage aux îles malouines fait en 1763 et 1764, avec des observations sur le détroit de Magellan et sur les Patagons, </em>while the English one reads: <em>The history of a voyage to the Malouine (or Falkland) Islands made in 1763 and 1764, under the command of M. de Bougainville, in order to form a settlement there; and of his two voyages to the Streights of Magellan, with an account of the Patagonians </em>... In his 'advertisement to the reader' the English editor hoped that the work would meet with the approbation of the public and listed what changes had been made, mainly in the way of additional maps and a rearrangement of the plates.</p><p>The narrative begins: 'I left Paris on the 17th of August 1763 at two o'clock in the afternoon ...' so that the reader is straight away in Pernetty's company before the departure of the <em>Aigle </em>and the <em>Sphinx </em>. His narrative of the outward voyage is always interesting, but cannot detain us here, except perhaps to note his vivid description of 'crossing the Line' (the Equator) while 'Bon-homme la Ligne, lord governor of these latitudes' and his court held sway. Of the Falkland Islands, which he explored a little on his own, encountering at one stage 'an animal of terrible appearance and astonishing size' (presumably a male sea-elephant), Pernetty wrote:</p><blockquote><blockquote>In the quarter of island which we saw, the land everywhere presents a very agreeable aspect. Mountains, or rather eminences which we called mountains, encompass plains further than the eye can see, divided by little rising grounds and hills which communicate by gentle declivities. At the foot of each, a rivulet, more or less considerable, runs in winding mazes, and discharges itself into the sea through the innumerable creeks of the bays.</blockquote></blockquote><p>He protested to Bougainville about the burning (for clearance) of one of the islands in what is now Berkeley Sound, in which 200 penguins died. His fears that the whole 'continent' would catch fire and that game would be destroyed, were further aroused when Bougainville took no notice and set fire to areas of the main island. On one occasion Pernetty went ashore to shoot geese, but got his powder wet so that, on discovering a path nine or ten inches wide, he was in fear of attack by unseen natives of the Islands (supposing that such people existed). He then fixed his bayonet. (The track must have been made by foxes.) It may have been Pernetty's idea to erect a cross on one of the hills, which was named 'Mountain of the Cross'.</p><p>He was much interested in the natural history of the Iles Malouines, and on finding the quartzite rocks too hard to examine, he concentrated on the flora and fauna. He tells us that he stuffed some bird specimens with moss and presented them later to the Abbey of St Maur to be placed in its cabinet of curiosities. He remarks on the beauty of the living birds' eyes. The folding plates at the end of the English edition of his narrative depict fishes, birds, a 'sea-wolf' (presumably a leopard seal), a 'sea-lion', a sea-elephant and some smaller creatures and plants. Perhaps the most interesting of the other illustrations is 'A view of Fort St Louis at Acarron Bay', under which is 'A Plan of Acarron Bay...' Another fine plate is a chart of:</p><blockquote><blockquote>Hawkins's Maiden-land and [called] afterwards FALKLAND'S ISLANDS, then by the French Isles Nouvelles &amp; Isles Malouines, by the Dutch Nova Belgica and lately by the Spaniards of Buenos-ayres Yslas de Magallanes.</blockquote></blockquote><p>This chart was by Thomas Jeffreys, Geographer to the (English) King and place names are sometimes given in two versions.</p><p>Before Bougainville's two ships departed from the Islands, a ceremony took place at Fort St Louis, in which Dom Pernetty must have officiated as priest. All present, including the 28 Acadians who were to form the colony, sang the <em>Te Deum </em>, but the wind blew too strongly for a full mass. '<em>Vive le Roy' </em>was shouted seven times and the commission of King Louis XV was delivered to Monsieur de <a href=\"/biographies/nerville_michel\">NERVILLE</a>, appointing him governor. Interestingly, towards the end of Pernetty's book, he prints a letter from de Nerville, dated 25 April 1765, giving an account of the colony and its progress during the succeeding months.</p><p>Pernetty made unsuccessful attempts to get the rules of the Benedictine order relaxed, but had to accept his nomination in April 1768 by Pope Clement XIII as abbot of Burgen in Westphalia in north eastern Germany. Later on in 1782, he took up the post of librarian to King Frederick the Great of Prussia, in Berlin. At least three of his books were published there. As one familiar with the occult, alchemy and the Swedenborgian rite, created by the Swedish theosophist Emmanuel Swedenborg, he co-founded the <em>Société des Illuminés d'Avignon  </em>in 1786. It seems that the chateau of La Tour Vaucros was put at his disposal by the then Marquess and it became, in the words of its present owner, the focus of 'mystical, philosophical and cultural encounters'. Pernetty died at his brother's house in Valence (Drôme) on 16 October 1801.</p><p>A short shrub which grows in Tierra del Fuego is known in the British Isles as prickly heath. Earlier named <em>Pernettya mucronata </em>, it is now identified as <em>Gaultheria mucronata. </em></p><p><a href=\"/biographies/nerville_michel\">See Image 248</a></p>",

        "body": " <p>Argentine president, was born on 8 October 1895 in Lobos,<b></b>in the province of Buenos Aires, to parents of Creole and Italian ancestry. He chose a career in the army and married Aurelia Tizón. In 1938, Perón was widowed, and in 1939 he went as part of a military mission to Italy - during Mussolini's administration, which he came to admire greatly. He is believed to have travelled widely in Europe on the eve of World War II, and sympathized with the Axis Powers.</p><p>After returning to Argentina, he was one of the officers who seized power in the 1943 military coup. But, unlike the vast majority of the military then, Perón associated himself with Argentina's workers and urban proletariat - the poor European immigrants, who were so despised by Argentina's upper classes. He came to dominate the increasingly powerful Labour Secretariat in that Junta. In 1944, Perón met the beautiful and flamboyant actress and broadcaster María Eva Duarte, 24 years his junior. She became his mistress, and is better known as Evita.</p><p>Perón's pro-labour activities led to such frantic opposition from right-wingers and the military that he was forced out of all his government positions in October 1945, and briefly imprisoned on the island of Martin Garcia. However, massive demonstrations by trade unionists secured his release on 17 October - a date still celebrated by Peronists. Evita's passionate radio broadcasts had played a role - of disputed importance - in whipping up support for him, and Perón married her in a private civil ceremony five days later.</p><p>With the support of the working class, and Evita's popularity, Perón was elected president in 1946. Argentina was a rich country then, as it had profited enormously from World War II. But Perón squandered much of this wealth on the grandiose social projects which Evita was so fond of - although she also secured some worthwhile elements, notably female suffrage. Illegitimate herself, she could not rise above the humiliations of her youth and took every opportunity to harass Argentina's upper classes. They detested her as a result.</p><p>Perón's populist policies included a major anti-British element. He adopted as government policy the Argentine claim to the Falklands, which had been revived just a few years earlier by the activities of Alfredo <a href=\"/biographies/palacios_alfredo\">PALACIOS</a>. Peron had also been encouraged by the Germans during World War II, and by the 'Committee for the Recovery of the Malvinas' which was formed in Buenos Aires on 19 October 1939, specifically to take advantage of the outbreak of war. Shortly after the war, Perón told Bill Hunter <a href=\"/biographies/christie_eric\">CHRISTIE</a>, then serving in the British Embassy in Buenos Aires, that he was going to use the Falklands to provide a diversion from domestic problems - a role in which the Falklands have been used ever since.</p><p>Perón also extended Argentine territorial claims to much of Antarctica and its adjacent islands in the South Atlantic. He issued a decree, on 24 June 1947, specifically claiming both South Georgia and the Falklands and there were a number of Argentine trespasses on Antarctic islands to which Britain had long standing territorial claims. On 17 December 1947 Britain offered arbitration on these new claims at the International Court of Justice in the Hague. But Perón rejected this on 28 January 1948, effectively saying that Argentine territory was not up for arbitration by anyone. Britain repeated these offers several times, from 1951 to 1954, and in 1955 tried to take the matter unilaterally to the Hague. This Argentina also rejected. Perón particularly alarmed the British during December 1947 and January 1948, when he sent warships to Antarctica. His pressure over the Falklands even led Foreign Secretary Ernest Bevin to warn Argentine Foreign Minister Bramuglia in 1948 that any attack on the Falklands would lead to war.</p><p>Perón also clashed with Britain over the nationalisation of the British owned railways in Argentina. These were in dire need of new investment and the concession for them was soon to expire anyway, but his confrontational style led him to nationalise them in 1947/48. The eventual deal actually paid far more compensation that they were worth. Many of the British staff then left, and inefficient state management led to the collapse of the railways in just a few years.</p><p>Perón was re-elected in 1952, but by then Evita was dying from cancer. She passed away on 26<sup></sup>July that year. Perón then struggled on alone, but was deposed in a military coup on 16 September 1955, and forced into exile where he remained for the next 18 years.</p><p>But Perón remained a hero to many working class Argentines and was allowed to return by interim president Raúl Alberto Lastiri in 1973. He arrived on 23 September and won the election on 12 October 1973 and became president again - this time with his third wife, María Estela Martínez de Perón (Isabelita), as vice-president.</p><p>Perón died on 1 July 1974 in the presidential residence at Olivos, and his wife assumed the presidency. Her administration was extremely unstable. Left-wing terrorists (the Montoneros), and right-wing death squads, such as the 'Triple A', began to operate. The military, led by General Jorge Videla, finally deposed and exiled her in March 1976. They then began the notorious 'Proceso' of national re-organisation which led to the 'Dirty War' and the murder of 20 to 30,000 Argentines. As their regime began to fall apart, the military launched the Falklands war, as a diversion from domestic problems.</p><p>Perón was buried first in the huge Chacarita cemetery in Buenos Aires. There, his tomb was violated in June 1987, and the hands cut off his corpse. In 2006, Perón's body was moved to a mausoleum at San Vicente outside Buenos Aires, where Perón had lived for much of his life in Argentina. This is now a place of pilgrimage for Peronists, and the political movement he founded remains a most important part of Argentine political life.</p>",

        "body": "<p>Argentine sailor and explorer, was born in Carmen de Patagones {Argentina} the son of Miguel Piedra Buena and Vicenta, née Rodriguez. He began his career as a sailor at the age of 11 under Captains John Lennon and James Harris. His principal benefactor was Captain WH <a href=\"/biographies/smyley_william\">SMYLEY</a>, who gave him early responsibilities as a member of the crew of the <em>John E Davison </em>. With Smyley he visited the Islands for the first time in 1848, even though it was only to re-provision the vessel on both outward and home journeys. Later he was present with Smyley at the discovery of the bodies of Allen <a href=\"/biographies/gardiner_allen\">GARDINER</a> and his mission party, all of whom had starved to death in 1851 on the shores of Tierra del Fuego. Subsequently he accompanied Smyley on a visit to the United States.</p><p>After Piedra Buena had established himself independently, he based himself on the island of Pavón in the mouth of the Santa Cruz River. His was the first permanent dwelling in southern Patagonia. From there he would journey on the schooner <em>Nancy </em>. He may have visited the Falkland Islands on other occasions, but no records of such visits survive. He visited the Atlantic islands to the south as far as Cape Horn, claiming sovereignty over that place for Argentina. The Argentine President Bartolomé Mitre expressed approval of his actions, as the use of more official channels was restricted by an existing formal agreement with Chile.</p><p>In 1865, he arrived at Stanley in the small vessel <em>Carlitos </em>. There he bought a cargo of coal which was lost in Montevideo. He visited the Islands in his schooner <em>Nancy (Esposa) </em>both in 1866 (March and April) and 1867 (February). On the last occasion, he met Richard <a href=\"/biographies/mayne_richard\">MAYNE</a>, commander of HMS <em>Nassau </em>, who made much use of Piedra Buena's detailed knowledge of Patagonian waters, urging him to install a buoy to mark the entrance to the Strait of Magellan. The most outstanding episode in the life of Piedra Buena in the Islands happened the following year with the shipwreck of the British barque <em>Coquimbana </em>. As the authorities subsequently accepted, he acted in good faith when he purchased the remains of the ship and its cargo of copper by auction in Stanley. But he lost the lawsuit against him, and as a result suffered financial losses from which he never recovered.</p><p>He married Luisa Dufour in 1868 and they had three children: Ana Vicenta (b1869), Luis Miguel (b1871), and Julia Elvira (b1876). He then made his final voyage in a private capacity in order to purchase cattle. In the same year the Argentine Government conceded to him Pavón and Staten Island {Isla de los Estados}. He was shipwrecked on the inhospitable shores of Staten Island, where he built a new boat called <em>Luisito </em>with the remains of the <em>Espora </em>, and got away. He was involved in a series of rescue operations of shipwrecked crews, and his disinterested and praiseworthy actions were formally recognised by various European governments. While assisting a group of Frenchmen trying to set up a colony in Patagonia, he travelled into the interior of Santa Cruz in the boat <em>Tucutuyú, </em>carrying with him a cow from the Falkland Islands and what has been described as a specimen of the warrah fox, which escaped into the desert.</p><p>He died in poverty in Buenos Aires on 10 August 1883. Only much later were his achievements recognised. He is considered the main figure in the establishment of Argentine sovereignty in Patagonia. In this, he acted at first in a private capacity - although he was in contact with the Argentine Government - until 1876 when he was designated an officer in the Navy. His contacts with the Falkland Islands occurred when he was acting in his business capacity. He remains today a well-known historical figure, commemorated by having a village facing Pavon Island named after him, as well as places in Tierra del Fuego and Antarctica. There are too street names in many cities, several of which incorporate commemorative busts.</p>",

        "body": "<p>official and whaling manager, was born at Bideford, Devon on 24 November 1917, the son of the Rev Rollo Pierce-Butler. He was educated at schools in Southampton and Winchester before entering the Air Service Training Establishment in 1936 in order to gain his Air Ministry radio licence. From May 1938 he was employed by Imperial Airways as a radio officer transferring a year later to Scottish Airways. At the beginning of World War II in September 1939 he was commissioned as second lieutenant in the Royal Signals, rising to the rank of captain in May 1941. In September 1942 he was posted to Orkney and Shetland Signals and was promoted major in 1945.</p><p>As radio was his speciality, Butler was recommended to the Royal Navy. In November 1945 he was placed in charge of communications for Operation Tabarin*, the British wartime operation in Antarctica which developed into the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey. Butler arrived at Stonington Island, Marguerite Bay in February 1946. At the end of that year he became base leader and in April 1947 leader of FIDS. In February 1948 the base was relieved by Dr Vivian <a href=\"/biographies/fuchs_sir\">FUCHS</a> and, after a short period at Deception Island in the South Shetland Islands, Pierce-Butler was appointed in April 1948 on the recommendation of the governor, Sir Miles <a href=\"/biographies/clifford_sir\">CLIFFORD</a>, secretary of FIDS - always known colloquially as SECFIDS - based in Stanley.</p><p>Pierce-Butler arrived in the Falklands on 12 November 1948 and was shortly thereafter appointed personal aide-de-camp to Governor Clifford. In January 1949 Clifford also appointed him commanding officer of the Falkland Islands Defence Force and in June 1949 the first controller of civil aviation. Pierce-Butler helped to choose the Auster light aircraft in the United Kingdom in 1948 for internal air service in the colony and to draw up specifications for the new radio equipment to be issued to all farms in the Camp:  <em>'Major Pierc </em>e-B <em>utler has shown notable initiative and resourcefulness in helping to start an air service here, in face of considerable physical and geographical difficulties' wrote Clifford. </em>In January 1950 he sailed south again in the  <em>John Biscoe </em>to Stonington to evacuate Fuchs and his team whereupon the base was closed.</p><p>On 15 March 1951 Pierce-Butler was appointed magistrate at South Georgia, taking up residence at King Edward Point. At this time, whaling was still in full swing on the Island with three land stations, Grytviken, Husvik and Leith all in operation. Pierce-Butler started to take an interest in the whaling business, particularly in whale catching, processing and production. His position in government and his interest in the industry brought him into contact with Alfredo <a href=\"/biographies/ryan_alfredo\">RYAN</a>, a Gibraltar-born Argentine businessman who owned the  <em>Compañia Argentina de Pesca </em>, the proprietors of Grytviken. Ryan wished to improve relations between his company and government and Pierce-Butler, who had by this time become disenchanted with the Colonial Service, was persuaded in early 1954 to join Ryan's whaling business. He had noted, during his period at South Georgia, that Ryan's company  <em>Pesca </em>was the poorest producer on the island and he set forth to address their problems. In the three years which followed, Pierce-Butler became manager - the first ever British manager of the company - and, to the chagrin of his predominantly Norwegian workforce, transformed its production and output by a comprehensive modernisation programme both at the land station and at sea. Financed by Ryan, antiquated whaling plant at Grytviken was replaced and a completely new fleet of whale catchers were built to hunt the decreasing number of whales which were now largely found some distance from the island. By 1957/58 Grytviken had overtaken its rivals in both the number of whales caught and quantity and quality of whale oil and meal production; good profits were returned. Pierce-Butler also laid the foundations for the transfer of Ryan's wholly owned whaling business from the Argentine to the British flag by the creation of a new company, Albion Star (South Georgia) Limited with its registered office at South Georgia and subsidiaries in Gibraltar and the United Kingdom.</p><p>In 1958, however, Pierce-Butler suddenly and mysteriously left Ryan's employ. There was rumour that Ryan, against Butler's wishes, had withheld further investment, because he had become nervous about the prospect of a total collapse in the whale population and a fall in the price of whale oil and other whale products. Pierce-Butler returned to England and became a 'whaling consultant'. He found work in South Africa for the Hector Whaling Company which ran a whaling station at Saldanha Bay, about 60 miles north from Cape Town. He saw this as a similar challenge to  <em>Pesca </em>, but the numbers of whales were decreasing and the station eventually closed in the mid-1960s. Butler then became involved in a number of South African businesses. As well as managing ships for a Cape Town based sea diamond mining company, he became the General Manager for Andrew M. Behr &amp; Co (Proprietary) Ltd, an arm of the Sierra Fishing Agency which operated, with Norwegian support, the infamous pirate whaling ship  <em>Sierra  </em>and a number of whale catchers registered under the dubious company name of Scandinavian Dry Cleaners <em>. </em>The Sierra Agency (and her predecessor the Run Fishing Agency) supplied lucrative quantities of frozen whale meat to the Japanese, obtained by catching whales and processing whale meat on the high seas in defiance of controls imposed by the International Whaling Commission. However, this business came to an abrupt end in 1979 when the Angolan civil war disrupted trans-shipments and conservationists rammed the  <em>Sierra.  </em>Eventually, after extensive repairs, the ship was sabotaged while she was in a Portuguese port preparing to sail. Butler then became the manager of a petrol station at Hout Bay, near Cape Town.</p><p>Pierce-Butler was married twice. Little is known of his first marriage other than that he declared it on his application for the SECFIDS post in April 1948. The marriage was thereafter dissolved. His second marriage, in the Register Office of the City of Westminster on 14 August 1954, was to his previously widowed housekeeper on South Georgia, Janet Cooper Horne neé Gilmour, twelve years his senior. She was the mother-in-law of Thomas Adair Carey, the wireless operator at King Edward Point from 1951-54. Mrs Horne had first arrived on the island to support Carey, his wife (who had become ill) and child, but when the Crown Agents failed to fill the post of chief steward she was appointed temporary stewardess on Pierce-Butler's recommendation 'to act as his housekeeper, supervise catering for single officers and be in charge of the provision and clothing store'. In December 1952 he reported her as 'entirely satisfactory' and she was confirmed in the post. When Pierce-Butler moved to  <em>Pesca </em>in 1954 she resided with him at Grytviken between 1955 and 1958. They had no children. Pierce-Butler died in South Africa in 1995.</p><p>An appraisal by Clifford in 1953 makes a generous epitaph: <em>'Butler has rendered some sterling service while in these parts ... in this last appointment, which entails more 'fieldwork' and personal contacts he has done very well and will be greatly missed by the whaling community... He ... can inspire confidence, respect and affection'. </em>Although Clifford noted ' <em>he does not shine in any form of office work,'  </em>he went on to commend him as  ' <em>loyal, energetic, zealous, and enthusiastic to a fault, most practical and a proved leader of men'. </em></p>",

        "body": " <p>Spanish admiral and senator, was born in Palos de Moguer (Huelva) on 23 December 1816. He began his career as a coast guard in Cadiz in 1833. After qualifying as an officer, he took part in various naval actions in Spanish waters and elsewhere. His distinguished conduct earned him first promotion to sub-lieutenant, then the award of the Cross of San Fernando and then the rank of captain of marines. In 1842, he was promoted to lieutenant-commander, and in 1843 to commander, at the same time becoming a colonel of marines. In 1847 he became a brigadier in the marines. In 1850, he was promoted to captain, in 1851 to commodore, in 1868 to rear-admiral and in 1881 he became an admiral.</p><p>In 1862 he was given overall command of the Spanish Scientific Expedition to the Pacific. This was intended to improve relations with the former Spanish colonies in South America and to re-establish the scientific work undertaken by Spain in the eighteenth century and thus integrate the kingdom into similar work which other European nations were undertaking at that time. The squadron comprised the frigates <em>Resolucion, Nuestra Senora del Triunfo </em>and the schooner <em>Virgen de Covadonga  </em>and a considerable group of professionals in different scientific specialities and techniques were embarked. Their work should have allowed a major advance in the knowledge of natural history and science and brought credit to the Spanish expedition.</p><p>The first part of the voyage took place in Atlantic waters and in the Strait of Magellan, where hostile weather caused the admiral to send the two frigates back to the Falkland Islands. They arrived in Stanley on 28 February 1863 and Governor <a href=\"/biographies/mackenzie_james\">MACKENZIE</a> paid a formal call on <em>Triunfo </em>(although the captain was out). The ships remained in Stanley harbour for six weeks and the expedition's naturalists took the opportunity to collect samples of the Islands' flora and fauna with help from the American sea captain William <a href=\"/biographies/smyley_william\">SMYLEY</a>. The chaplain, Charles <a href=\"/biographies/bull_charles\">BULL</a>, showed them his personal collection of plants and specimens. The expedition's photographer, Rafael de Castro y Ordonez took three views of Stanley from the <em>Triunfo </em>moored in the harbour: they are probably the first photographs ever taken in the colony. He recorded his - none too favourable - impressions of the Islands:</p><blockquote><blockquote>The land is in a sad condition: it has around 300 habitants, 30 Catholics and the rest Protestants... The vegetation is scarce, the ground is formed by something like peat which is burnt in the stoves as lumps and gives off a good heat. Amazing resources left providentially in such an extremely cold and unpleasant country.</blockquote></blockquote><p>The frigates left Stanley on 11 April and Governor <a href=\"/biographies/mackenzie_james\">MACKENZIE</a> reported to London:</p><blockquote><blockquote><em>I have afforded these two vessels every assistance in my power in executing some necessary repairs before proceeding to sea and it gives me great pleasure to inform [the Secretary of State] of the friendly spirit evinced by the Spanish Admiral who, although I previously informed him that I was unable to return a salute, fired the usual number of Guns to our Flag. </em></blockquote></blockquote><p>Pinzon's ships sailed round the Horn to rejoin the rest of the expedition at Valparaiso. The next phase was carried out along the Pacific coast particularly in Chilean and Peruvian territory. Unfortunately Pinzon was not up the standard demanded by the importance and responsibility of his position. His intemperate character contributed to the failure of his mission and led to unpleasant incidents throughout the long voyage. Among these, and without doubt the worst, were the incidents that occurred during their stay in Peruvian waters and culminated in his occupation of the Chinchas Islands. This outrage to Peruvian sovereignty led to the absurd war between that country, Chile and Spain. That ill-fated event earned the unanimous condemnation of the peoples of America, and gave rise to such animosity against the Spanish Scientific Expedition that it had to return to Europe rapidly.</p><p>On reaching the highest naval rank, Luis Hernandez Pinzon was made a senator of the kingdom, and received other honours and distinctions. He died in 1891 in the same city as he was born. Some years after his death, the Spanish Government had his remains transferred to the San Fernando Pantheon of Famous Mariners at Seville.</p>",

        "body": "<p>strong>The First Generation</strong></p><p>Andrez Pitaluga was the son of Benito and Celestina, née Spinola, and was born in Gibraltar on 26 September 1822. The family were originally fishermen, from Sestri di Ponente near Genoa in Italy. As a young man Andrez migrated down through South America, via Montevideo, with fellow Gibraltarians Pascal and Angela Recano, arriving for the first time in the Islands in November 1838. (Port Louis records show Lt <a href=\"/biographies/lowcay_robert\">LOWCAY</a> of HM Ketch <em>Sparrow</em> giving them permission to rebuild an old ruined house in the settlement.) On 11 September 1841 he was taken on contract as <em>capataz</em> (foreman) of the gauchos, primarily engaged in catching and taming wild horses and slaughtering wild cattle.</p><p>Andrez Pitaluga worked all over East Falkland, at various early ranching locations including down in Lafonia for the Lafone brothers around 1852, and at Second Corral (the early Teal Inlet settlement), where there was a considerable hide salting works established. Being something of a mason, he had a hand in building a number of stone cattle corrals and cottages around East Falkland and also on Saunders Island. At Gibraltar Station, three out of four dwellings and a small barn constructed in stone by him still exist and are in use and in Stanley he built the large stone house at 33 Fitzroy Road, formerly known as the ‘Pink Shop’.</p><p>The 1851 census notes him as ‘Andreas Pintaluga’, a gaucho and the father of three small children, James (b1846), Andrez (b1848) and Celestine (b1850). Their mother is not named but it was Margaret McIntosh Edwards, whom Andrez married at Hope Place, Lafonia in 1850 or 1851. After marriage they had a further seven children: Joseph (b1851 - died young), Alexander (b1853; married Agnes Mercer and died age 47, see below), Henry (Harry) (b1856 and died age 69 - see below), Richard (b1858; moved to Chile), Arthur (b1860; moved to Uruguay and died age 76), Frederick (b1861 - died young), Helen (b1865) and Maria (b1867 - died an infant).</p><p>In 1869, Andrez began to acquire small areas of former Crown Grant land in the north of East Falkland, with surrounding leases, to begin farming on his own account. During this time, he faced a considerable battle with the Falkland Islands Company, who were opposed to the granting of additional leases to him, but he had the support of government in continuing to develop the area, particularly around Salvador Water.</p><p><strong>Later Generations </strong></p><p>Andrez died on 16 June 1878 and his wife followed him on 4 May 1879. His sons Alexander and Harry continued to build on the lands acquired; the leases of some of these stretched at one time from Cow Bay southwards to Berkeley Sound, and west as far as Fanning Head. The land holding was gradually reduced to the two sections, Gibraltar Station and Rincon Grande, situated respectively on the west and east sides of the entrance to Port Salvador.</p><p>Alexander had seven children, including sons Donald (Andrez) (1884-1936) and Alexander (Alec) (1891-1958). Donald ran the Gibraltar Station section, until his death, to be followed by Alec who had worked in Chile and Stanley. Alec had earlier built a bungalow and settled himself and family on the farm in 1930.</p><p>Rincon Grande was by then owned and managed by Harry Pitaluga’s sons, Stan and Arthur. They were followed by Arthur’s daughter Diana and her husband Ronald Turner, followed in turn by their son Arthur, with his wife Elaine.</p><p>Alec Pitaluga had four children, and the youngest, Robin, (b1933, married Jene Robinson in 1956) took over the remaining family property in 1955. He served as elected councillor from 1968 to 1971 and again as nominated councillor from 1971 to 1976. Between 1974 and 1992 he was chairman of the Sheep Owners Association for a total of ten years. He continues to participate actively in the administration of farm company affairs and is a shareholder and director of the fishing company Argos. Robin and Jene Pitaluga have two sons, Nicholas (b1963, married Antoinette Bendyshe in 1997), and Saul (b1967, married Caroline Edwards in 1996). The farm continues to concentrate on fine wool production and is managed by Nick and Annie, whilst Saul and his family live and work in England.</p><p><a href=\"?q=node/106\">See Image 80</a></p>",

He had a sister, Audrey (born 1918) and a younger brother, Anthony (born 1919). After study with a nanny/governess, Pole-Evans was sent to school in England at an early age with his brother, Anthony. Douglas moved on to studies in Wales gaining valuable knowledge about grass growing in different terrains to be subsequently applied in the Falklands. He returned to the Islands in 1936, where he joined the Waldron sheep farm at Port Howard under the management of his father. Here he was to remain for the rest of his working life, save for service with the Falkland Islands Defence Force during World War II, when he was commissioned as a lieutenant under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Austen WOODGATE.</p><p>Towards the end of the war, Pole-Evans met Colonel Woodgate's daughter, Yvonne Mary Woodgate (widely known as Mary) born in Kent, England, on 27 August 1923. With her parents, Mary had arrived in the Falkland Islands a year or two beforehand when her father had been appointed superintendent of public works. 1946 was an eventful year. Pole-Evans and Mary Woodgate wed on 23 April 1946 at Christ Church Cathedral, Port Stanley. Two days later, Pole-Evans was appointed a Justice of the Peace for the Port Howard area. A month or so later he succeeded his father as farm manager at Port Howard. There were two children from the marriage, Susan Mary (b1948) and Glyn Markham (b1950). Susan married Robin Lee, who himself later became the farm manager at Port Howard. Glyn remained in England after his studies to be employed by an oil company.</p><p>Come 1950, Pole-Evans began a wide-ranging redevelopment programme at Port Howard. Initially the priority was replacement of roofing and internal insulation, extending to installation of showers and bathrooms. Horses, carts and wagons were replaced by tractors and Landrovers. In 1955 came the introduction of electricity generators to mechanise sheep shearing. All households and workshops were equipped with electric power, later to be extended to the outlying homes of the shepherds. Pole-Evans was a vastly energetic and lively man with the capacity to get on with his fellow men at all levels. He regarded the redevelopment programme as the major achievement of his career, and took much comfort from its success, recognising the encouragement he received from the Waldron board of directors.</p><p>Along the way, and never idle, he maintained an involvement with the all important Falklands Sheep-owners Association, followed by a full commitment to hosting the West Falkland Sports Association occasions when held over several days at Port Howard. The 1966 event, combined with the centenary year celebration of the Waldron farm, was enjoyed by a wide attendance. Unlike his father, he was never a member of LegCo, but served in other ways maintaining a close rapport with the colonial governors of the day. His management at Port Howard continued over 31 years, ever efficient and in keeping with the times. By 1977 he began to feel the hardship of climbing the hilly countryside, thus choosing to retire at the age of 60 years. This concluded a continuous family connection of 73 years at the Waldron farm. A commendable input into one of the largest sheep farms of the Falkland Islands, and one held in the highest esteem.</p><p>Pole-Evans, accompanied by his wife Mary and his mother Orissa, departed for the UK in 1977 to retire in the Devon village of Upottery, close to their son, Glyn. Towards the end of 1991, Pole-Evans revisited the Falklands but a few days after his arrival at Pebble Island, he collapsed and died on 8 January 1992. His gravestone at Port Howard reads: <em>He came home to rest.</em></p>",

After school, Pole-Evans travelled to Canada to engage in a logging operation. While there, he saw an advertisement seeking a farm cadet in the Falkland Islands. This appealed to him and he was successful in gaining the appointment, which was to change the whole course of his working life. At about 21, he arrived in the Falklands in 1904 to join the isolated large sheep farm owned by James <a href=\"/biographies/waldron_james\">WALDRON</a>, at Port Howard on West Falkland. He was fortunate to work under Edmund Mathews, a vastly experienced man in local sheep farming who had married into the Waldron family. Pole-Evans succeeded Mathews as farm manager in 1908 and never looked back, applying his own theories towards the development of the farm.</p><p>On 29 April 1916 Pole-Evans married Orissa Lewis at Christ Church Cathedral, Stanley, amid a large congregation. She came from a Patagonia Missionary Society background and was born at the Society's settlement at Keppel Island on 24 September 1893. Her mother died there two years later after childbirth and in the absence of her father in South America, Orissa was taken into care and later adopted by Mrs Orissa <a href=\"/biographies/dean_orissa\">DEAN</a> at Port Stanley. Here Orissa grew up to become a popular and widely liked person, which continued into her life at Port Howard. Pole-Evans and his wife had a great attachment to Port Howard over many years. They had three children: Douglas <a href=\"/biographies/pole-evans_douglas\">POLE-EVANS</a> (b1917), Audrey (b1918) and Anthony (b1919). A nanny/governess was engaged for their early welfare and upbringing. The two sons were sent off to the UK for further education, ending in attendance at agricultural colleges while Audrey married George Stewart locally in 1940.</p><p>Pole-Evans played his part in hosting the West Falkland Sports Association meetings, a highlight of the calendar when held over several days at Port Howard. As manager he represented his employer at the meetings of the Sheep Owners Association, a forum embracing local matters of common interest and unity with a history going back to the nineteenth century. In community affairs he was appointed JP for the Port Howard area, and subsequently awarded the OBE in 1937 for public service. Two years later he entered LegCo serving there for ten years. In all, a strong and resourceful personality commanding much respect for his commitment to the Falkland Islands in both sheep farming and community concerns. In 1936 the stock adviser to FIG, DSA Weir, wrote that most farm managers appeared to 'convey the impression that they look on Pole-Evans as some sort of Superman, whose efforts have exceeded anything that they would themselves be capable of carrying out...'</p><p>He retired in 1946 after 42 years service to be succeeded by his son, Douglas, who had been working alongside him since1936. Pole-Evans and his wife continued to live on the farm until his death on 19 June 1952. He is buried in the cemetery at Stanley. His younger son Anthony also farmed, partly at Port Howard and currently owns Saunders Island in partnership with his own youngest son David. The family tradition lives on.</p>",

        "body": "<p>mariner. Little is known of the origins of Captain Charles Poole, one of the great seafaring characters in Falklands history. In 1900 he signed a declaration before the registrar in Stanley saying that he was 'a natural-born British subject and a native of Jersey.' There is a story in his family that the name Poole was a pseudonym and that he had been born 'Lawrence de Laing', but at present there is no documentary evidence to support this. Poole came to the Falklands in 1891 in the German barquentine  <em>Concordia </em>, wrecked on 17 August on the north coast of East Falkland, near the bay which is today named after the ship. There was a heavy swell when the ship went ashore, the lifeboats were badly damaged and there seemed little hope of the crew surviving. However Charles Poole fastened a light line to himself and swam ashore. A heavier line was attached to this and everybody then got ashore, greatly owing to Poole, apart from the Master and the two mates, who refused to leave the ship and were drowned.</p><p>Charles Poole stayed in the Falklands working mainly on coasting schooners. He was a very clever man and soon taught himself navigation. In 1900 in partnership with four others, he bought the schooner  <em>Allen Gardiner  </em>which had previously belonged to the Keppel Mission Station. In March 1902 he arrived at West Point Island. The  <em>Allen Gardiner </em>was beached in the sheltered cove and the ship's bottom cleaned. Other minor repairs were done with the help of my great-uncle, Arthur <a href=\"/biographies/felton_arthur\">FELTON</a>. Poole and Arthur Felton were very good friends. The West Point wool was then loaded for Port Stanley. Sadly, on the way to Port Stanley the  <em>Gardiner  </em>ran ashore in thick fog on the north coast of East Falkland, not far from where the  <em>Concordia </em>had been wrecked. The loss of all the West Point wool was a heavy one, as it does not appear to have been insured. However, a year or so later a schooner anchored in West Point. Charles Poole landed and over lunch he remarked to my Uncle that he thought they should start unloading and wondered if Uncle and his men could help. Uncle was puzzled and said he was not expecting any cargo. It then was realized what a fine man Poole was. On board was a mile of fencing and all the material needed to build an extension on the house. Arthur Felton had had to cancel this because of the loss of all his wool. Charles Poole had bought the materials himself, saying there was no charge for any of it and he hoped it would help to make up for the loss.</p><p>Poole was of course a seal poacher, but so were many others. The Falkland Islands Government were after him from time to time for this and a variety of other misdemeanours and he made several appearances in court. In order to confuse the authorities, he once changed the colour of his schooner  <em>Rapida </em>. He also altered the rig, making a very good job of it. He came to West Point one day afterwards and my Uncle, assuming Poole had a new boat, asked what had happened to the  <em>Rapida.  </em>Poole said, 'Well, I have changed her a little!' Charles Poole was a kindly man and well liked by many people - especially those on the small islands. My mother told me that one day when the  <em>Fortuna </em>was becalmed off the coast of East Falkland, another vessel was near and a boat came over. It was Poole and he brought cases of fruit for everyone on the  <em>Fortuna. </em></p><p>Poole was known as a daring and skilled seaman and discovered many passages around the Falklands, especially the Jason Islands, which no ship was known to have passed through before him. He often visited the Diego Ramirez Islands, which lie well to the south-­west of Cape Horn, in the roughest seas in the world. Many of Poole's crews were deserters from sailing ships on the west coast of Chile. Most were heavy drinkers and difficult to handle. Incidents which involved the police sometimes occurred in Port Stanley, as they did with the crews of other ships.</p><p>The  <em>Rapida </em>was anchored off the Patagonian coast near Punta Loyola one day in 1908 when a quarrel broke out among the crew and Poole fell or was thrown overboard. The story went that he was then shot in the water with a heavy sealing rifle. Two crew members and the pilot were later arrested on the Coast, but the true circumstances of Poole's death never became clear. A one-eared Chilean named Emilia or Amelia, who later often visited the Falklands as a crew member of other coasting vessels, <em> </em>was widely believed here <em> </em>to have been implicated in the incident.When the news of Poole's death reached the Falklands, Governor <a href=\"/biographies/allardyce_sir\">ALLARDYCE</a> wrote to Arthur Felton: 'So Charles Poole has passed away with his boots on! His energy was misdirected. Personally, notwithstanding his many faults, I had a sort of sneaking liking for him. I think his cheek, his daring and his skill all appealed to me'. Allardyce even sent a despatch about Poole to Lord Crewe, the secretary of state for the colonies:</p><blockquote><blockquote>Despite his piratical and buccaneering propensities, he was a clever, civil-spoken and daring mariner. Only once was it possible for this government to obtain a conviction against him...He was invariably smart and well-dressed and in a land of phlegmatic people...it was a pleasure to come across a person of indomitable energy.</blockquote></blockquote><p>Charles Poole married Celina (also known as 'Celia' or 'Annie') Margaret Anne Alazia on 18 June 1894 in St. Mary's Catholic Church in Stanley. They had five children, although family life was unstable, with Poole frequently away at sea and in South America. Their second son, Charlie, was known locally as a famous horseman and was 95 years old when he died in 1993.</p><p>Poole was a bold adventurer, who in spite of his unconventional way of life earned the respect of many. He was typical of a generation of enterprising and courageous mariners who became a mainstay of pioneer settlement in the Falklands. The channel to the north west of West Point Island, between Cape Terrible and The Slipper, was always known as 'Poole's Passage', although it has never been officially marked as such on maps.</p>",

He first came to prominence when he served as master's mate in the  <em>Discovery </em>during <a href=\"/biographies/cook_james\">COOK</a>'s third voyage, transferring to the  <em>Resolution </em>, Cook's ship, in August 1779. In 1785 the King George's Sound Company was founded in order to send an expedition to the north-west coast of America to prosecute the maritime fur trade between there and China. Portlock was given the command of the  <em>King George </em>and the expedition, while George <a href=\"/biographies/dixon_george\">DIXON</a> was given command of the smaller  <em>Queen Charlotte </em>as his consort. The expedition sailed from St Helen's Road, off Portsmouth, on 17 September 1785 and, after calling at Guernsey, Madeira and Porto Praya in the Cape Verde Islands, the Falklands were sighted on 2 January 1786.</p><p>Portlock had informed Dixon of his intention to call at Port Egmont in order to refit and water both ships, even though neither vessel held a chart of the islands. After sighting 'something from the mast-head which had greatly the appearance of a ship under sail', which he failed to identify as the Eddystone Rock, Portlock anchored in Port Egmont on 5 January. Having been at sea on 25 December, 8 January was celebrated as Christmas Day with a double issue of brandy and a walk on shore. The remains of <a href=\"/biographies/clayton_samuel\">CLAYTON</a>'s settlement and garden were found in which there were a few flowers and vegetables, such as horseradish, shallots, a few small potatoes and some celery. A bullock, a cow and several hogs were also sighted. As well as watering ship, seven tons of stone ballast were embarked. On 15 January the American sloop  <em>Speedwell </em>, commanded by Captain Coffin, anchored off the ruined settlement. Coffin informed Portlock that he was a tender to the  <em>United States </em>, Captain Hussey, which was anchored in a good harbour in Swan {Weddell} Island, together with the  <em>Canton </em>, Captain Whippey, both vessels being employed 'in the oil trade' and that Hussey had on board six or seven thousand seal skins. Having consulted Dixon, Portlock decided to make for Swan Island in order to purchase these skins if the price was right, as there was a great probability of them selling well in China. On 19 January, Portlock, with Dixon in company, got under way and set a course for Swan Island. While Coffin proceeded through Byron Sound, Portlock and Dixon rounded the north side of Saunders Island. After anchoring overnight off Carcass Island, they were joined by Coffin, who piloted them into West Point Harbour. The following morning they got under way again and shortly after midday anchored in States Bay {Chatham Bay} on the north-east side of Swan Island, where the  <em>Canton, United States,  </em>and the sloops  <em>Speedwell </em>and  <em>Maria </em>, tenders to the  <em>United States, </em>were at anchor. Captain Hussey was, however, unwilling to sell his seal skins and so on the morning of 23 January Portlock and Dixon got under way and after rounding the northern end of New Island set a course for Le Maire Strait. In his published account Portlock described and illustrated three Falkland Island birds. Of these his Rusty Crown'd Plover is easily identified as the Two-banded Plover ( <em>Charadrius falklandicus </em>) and his Cinereus Lark as the Falkland Pipit ( <em>Anthus correndera grayi </em>). However, both his illustration and description of his Yellow Winged Bunting cannot be reconciled to any Falkland Island bird.</p><p>On reaching the north-west coast of America the expedition spent two seasons collecting sea otter skins which were sold profitably in Macau, before returning to England in August 1788. In 1791 Portlock was appointed in command of the  <em>Assistant </em>as tender to the  <em>Providence </em>, Captain William Bligh, on the latter's successful second voyage to Tahiti to take breadfruit plants to the West Indies. On the ships' return to England, Portlock was promoted to commander on 4 November 1793. In 1799 when in command of the sloop  <em>Arrow </em>he captured the Dutch ship  <em>Draak </em>for which he was promoted captain on 28 September 1799. He does not appear to have had any further service afloat. Due to ill health he was admitted to Greenwich Hospital where he died on 12 September 1817. Portlock's only son was born at Gosport Hants, on 30 September 1794: as Major General Joseph Ellison Portlock, Royal Engineers, he was a noted geologist and surveyor.</p>",

        "body": "<p>ornithologist, was born in Lincoln on 1 June 1948, son of Lesley Nigel Prince and Ilse, née Moggenburg. He attended Bishop King School before joining the Forestry Commission in 1963. Even then, however, his passion was for ornithology, especially bird ringing. He already held the British Trust for Ornithology's (BTO) highest (A-ringer) qualification - for a decade the only paper qualification he possessed and was active both locally and in organising overseas expeditions, especially to Spain.</p><p>Prince joined the Life Sciences Division of the British Antarctic Survey in 1971 as a South Georgia field assistant. He rose steadily after official employment as a scientific officer in 1978 to become a principal scientific officer, an extraordinary achievement for a scientist whose only formal qualification was election as a Member of the Institute of Biology in 1980. At his untimely death in 1998, he was internationally recognised as a world authority on the ecology and biology of seabirds and as one of the most original, charismatic and influential of field scientists. Overall, he spent all or part of 18 summer seasons at South Georgia (including two and a half years continuously on his original appointment) becoming one of its greatest experts. His experience included several circumnavigations of South Georgia with Jerome and Sally Poncet and making two widely shown television films ( <em>The Return of the Fur Seal </em>and  <em>The Million-tonne Shrimp, </em>on krill) with Bruce Pearson.</p><p>His initial role with BAS was working for Mike Payne studying the recovery of Antarctic fur seals at Bird Island in the summer and the status of the introduced herds of reindeer at Husvik, Barff Peninsula and Royal Bay in winter. However, Prince immediately saw the opportunity to start work on the then almost unknown petrels of South Georgia, beginning with Antarctic Prion, Diving Petrels and Blue Petrel (being the first to discover the last species breeding at South Georgia). This pioneering work persuaded Richard Laws (then head of Life Sciences, subsequently director, of British Antarctic Survey) to re-employ Prince in 1976 to commence research on albatrosses, the start of a lifelong collaboration with John Croxall who had just arrived to take charge of bird and mammal research.</p><p>Over the next 20 years, Prince's exceptional abilities as a field naturalist and experimental scientist, coupled with an intuitive ability to devise new ways of studying seabirds' life at sea, revolutionised this branch of marine ecology. He was particularly distinguished for pioneering the use of a variety of remote-recording instruments (burrow recorders, weighing platforms, activity recorders), many of which he linked to satellite- tracking studies, using these combined technologies to determine where and how seabirds went, what they did there and how this related to their reproduction and survival. He also developed new ways of studying seabird diets, and rekindled interest in moult by decoding the remarkable patterns of feather replacement in albatrosses. He also started recording, and later mapping, schemes for South Georgia wildlife, both at sea and on land, laying the foundations for the subsequent checklists and atlases of South Georgia wildlife.</p><p>In addition, from 1976 he was base commander at Bird Island. His skills were nowhere more evident than in equipping and rebuilding (twice, including the move to year-round occupancy in late-1982) a field station whose operations and efficiency became legendary. Indeed, Prince revelled in the challenge of organising and motivating diverse people into creative teams, particularly in discovering the practical skills of scientists and unexpected fieldwork abilities of builders.</p><p>Back in the UK, he married Frances Olivia Prosser in 1978: they had two sons Oliver (b1983) and Guy (b1985). He found time not only to be a great family man but to run a BTO constant-effort ringing site, organise gravel pit restoration with Redlands, publish on Hobby falcons and dragonflies, and coach a school football team! He was an inspired leader, in everyday life as well as through his scientific example and publications. A legend at South Georgia, widely known in the Falklands, he was an inspiration to young scientists from around the world with whom he worked in the field.</p><p>His legacy is only partly in his scientific papers and films; it is equally in the careers of those he inspired and worked with. He was awarded a Polar Medal in 1978 and is commemorated by Prince Creek at Bird Island, Prince House at the Bird Island base, the Prince Room in the South Georgia Museum and the Peter Prince Memorial Nature Reserve near Godmanchester, Cambs.</p>",

        "body": "<p>naturalist, was born at Dynevor Castle, Dyfed, Wales on 6 August 1904, the second son of Sir Reginald Rankin, second baronet and his wife, née the Hon Nest Rhys. He was educated at Eton and Christ Church College, Oxford, and in 1924, he was the photographer with the Oxford University Arctic Expedition to Spitzbergen. From 1929 to 1931 he was staff photographer for <em>The Field </em>. In 1931 he married Lady Jean Dalrymple, elder daughter of the 12th Earl of Stair. They had two sons: Ian (b1932) and Alick (b1935). At the outbreak of World War II, Rankin joined the Scots Guards and became a lieutenant-colonel in 1943. He lived at Calgary on Mull, and before the war had bought the Treshnish Islands, west of Mull, to preserve their wildlife. He died suddenly in Bechuanaland {Botswana} on 7 April 1965, while making a film about Cecil Rhodes.</p><p>Rankin has been described as laird, farmer, stalker, shooter, climber, conservationist, yachtsman, photographer, ornithologist and writer. He was best known as a traveller and wildlife photographer. He organised expeditions to many parts of the world, including Tibet, Indochina, Iceland, tropical Africa, Australia and Alaska, but he was usually so busy arranging one expedition that he rarely found time to write up the previous one or to print his photographs. The result is that his activities are not well known. He is best remembered for one photograph - a gannet landing on the Bass Rock in the Firth of Forth which won several prizes, among them a European medal presented in 1937 by Hermann Goering - and two books - <em>Haunts of British Divers </em>and <em>Antarctic Isle </em>. The latter describes his expedition to South Georgia.</p><p>Rankin visited South Georgia in the austral summer of 1946-7 to photograph and observe its wildlife. The expedition was conceived prior to World War II and before the war had ended he had found the boat he required for navigating in South Georgia waters. This was a 30-year old mahogany lifeboat which had been built for the Royal National Lifeboat Institution but later converted into a cabin cruiser. It was refurbished and had new motors installed. Christian Salvesen's company agreed to transport the boat, renamed <em>Albatross </em>, to South Georgia on the factory ship <em>Southern Venturer </em>. Two Shetlanders, Campbell Gray and Robert Inkster, were engaged as crew and they were joined in South Georgia by a Norwegian whaler, Konrad Olsen.</p><p>On 6 December 1946, <em>Albatross </em>left Leith Harbour for the Bay of Isles where the breeding behaviour of the king penguin was studied at Salisbury Plain. The wandering albatross was also studied on Albatross Island. After two weeks, a cruise was made along the western end of South Georgia and many landings were made and seabirds counted. On returning to Leith Harbour to restock, Olsen was replaced by Henry Johannessen and <em>Albatross </em>retraced her course to the Bay of Isles and then west again to Elsehul and Bird Island. Leith Harbour was visited again for more supplies and then <em>Albatross </em>headed eastwards to visit Grytviken, Ocean Harbour, Larsen Harbour (where the small colony of Weddell Seals was observed) and Cooper Bay. More photographs were taken and seabird colonies counted.</p><p>The last stage of the expedition consisted of catching penguins for zoos in Britain and <em>Albatross </em>was shipped for the UK on <em>Southern Harvester </em>on 20 April 1947. The results of the expedition were published in Rankin's book, <em>Antarctic Isle </em>, one of the best accounts of South Georgia, its birds and seals.</p>",

        "body": "<p>sculptor and engraver, was born at Westminster, in London, on 8 October 1874, the son of Walter Ransom, a builder. He studied at the Lambeth School of Art and the Royal Academy School and lived and worked in London all his life. In 1903 Ransom won the prestigious Landseer Scholarship and exhibited at the Royal Academy. In 1910 the London County Council commissioned Ransom to design a school attendance medal. Ransom's design was used for the medals awarded after 1914 which depicted a likeness of King <a href=\"/biographies/george_v\">GEORGE</a> V, and these medals have become known as the 'King's Medals'. The King particularly approved of Ransom's work, and he was received at a private audience at Buckingham Palace on 4 February 1911. Ransom was also responsible for the notable war memorials of Portrush (Co Antrim) and Hove (Sussex).</p><p>Ransom was an instructor at the Clerkenwell and Hammersmith School of Art. He was also a friend and personal assistant to the eminent sculptor Sir George Frampton RA (1860-1928) for more than twenty years. Frampton is probably best known for his bronze statue of Peter Pan which stands in Kensington Gardens, London.</p><p>On 8 December 1914 the German East Asiatic Fleet was destroyed by a British Cruiser Squadron, under the command of Admiral <a href=\"/biographies/sturdee_sir\">STURDEE</a>, in the Battle of the Falkland Islands. After such a narrow escape from foreign invasion, it is small wonder that some desired to build a lasting monument to the Battle. The driving force behind the financing and construction of the Battle Monument was FE <a href=\"/biographies/cobb_frederick\">COBB</a>, the managing director of the Falkland Islands Company.</p><p>In September 1920, Cobb approached Sir George Frampton about a possible design for a monument that was more than merely an obelisk. Frampton however nominated Frank Ransom as the person who should be commissioned to design the monument which was constructed in Frampton's studios.</p><p>The <em>Oropesa </em>brought a small model of Ransom's design to the Falkland Islands in April 1924 and a similar model was exhibited in the Falkland Islands section of the 1924 Wembley Exhibition. The total amount of subscriptions raised was £6115; Frank Ransom's contract for the work was £3500. The balance of the funds was used for construction of the base of the monument, for site improvement, and for a commemorative tablet to be fixed in the Cathedral. Shipping and the collection of subscriptions were handled by the Falkland Islands Company.</p><p>Various locations for the monument were considered and the local committee proposed that the monument be erected in the centre of Victory Green, at the junction of Ross Road and Villiers Street. Ransom strongly objected, writing on 30 March 1925:</p><blockquote><blockquote>After due consideration with Sir George Frampton, I have come to the conclusion that the site proposed, in the centre of Victory Green, is not the best that could be chosen. My reasons are as follows. The Memorial would be below the level of the road, and lose in dignity in consequence. There would not be sufficient space between the Memorial and the sea wall to get a proper perspective of the front view; it would be difficult to approach, owing to the necessary steepness of the steps.</blockquote></blockquote><p>The London-based Memorial fund committee supported Ransom but the Stanley committee strongly disagreed. Progress on the project was halted.</p><p>In 1926 the project was revived after gaining the strong support of Governor <a href=\"/biographies/middleton_sir\">MIDDLETON</a>. Cobb wrote to the governor, and also to the colonial secretary (H <a href=\"/biographies/henniker_heaton\">HENNIKER HEATON</a>) 'I know how keen you are to see a start made with the erection of the Monument'. The colonial engineer, George <a href=\"/biographies/roberts_george\">ROBERTS</a>, was placed in charge of the project and drew up the installation plans and costings. At the suggestion of the governor, the monument was to be placed at the western end of the town - the site of the old quarantine station (locally known as 'Little Italy'). Roberts supervised the clearing and improvement of the site.</p><p>In early 1926 the Cornish granite blocks of the monument were unloaded at Sulivan Jetty and transported to the site using a light railway which was laid for the purpose. Some of the rails were subsequently used as reinforcement bars in the construction of the base. The individual blocks weighed over two tons. The foundation was begun in May 1926, and work was completed on 22 July 1926, with the statue of Victory bearing Ransom's signature. On 26 February 1927 the 1914 Battle Monument was officially unveiled; a public holiday was declared and there were three days of celebrations. On 3 May 1927 - nearly ten years after he had first proposed the erection of a monument - FE Cobb wrote to the under secretary of state at the Colonial Office offering the Battle Monument to the colonial government: 'to be held in perpetuity as a record of the victory of the British Fleet and of the deliverance of the Colony from the peril that threatened it'.</p>",

        "body": " <p>forestry officer, was born on 10 July 1893 at Markinch in Fife, Scotland. His father was a forester on the Balbirnie Estate, and Reid began work as an apprentice forester in September 1908. After five years experience he went on to the Royal Botanic Gardens in Edinburgh (RBG) on 4 August 1913 to further his education and to attain academic qualifications. Reid did well in all aspects of forestry; his academic record shows that he acquired a wide range of knowledge and experience during his time at the RBG.</p><p>On 17 March 1920 ST <a href=\"/biographies/johnston_william\">JOHNSTON</a>, the colonial secretary at Stanley, wrote to the secretary of state asking for the help of the Royal Botanic Garden at Kew in the appointment of a suitably qualified forester. Kew consulted a leading exert, William Dallimore, who advised that James Reid should be appointed as forest officer. Reid was eventually appointed by Governor <a href=\"/biographies/middleton_sir\">MIDDLETON</a>, and served in the Falkland Islands from 1920 until 1926.</p><p>Reid's first task was to help Robert <a href=\"/biographies/blake_robert\">BLAKE</a> extend the Hill Cove plantation. He also planted trees on Mount Low and at Sparrow Cove (where extensive drainage was required) and established a plantation at Government House. Seed beds and a tree nursery were also established in the garden of Sulivan House in Stanley. Reid brought cuttings (848 in total) from Kew and seedlings (18,000 in total) from Chester of both coniferous and broad-leaved tree species. New Zealand flax was also sent from Kew and in September 1923 young trees were supplied from South America - 200 plants of Southern Beech ( <em>Nothafagus antarctica </em>) and 200 plants of Southern Beech ( <em>Nothafagus obliqua </em>).</p><p>Reid found that some farmers were helpful and willing to give good ground for tree planting; others however were very 'reluctant to part with precious feeding ground.' His difficulties with imported trees gradually convinced him that trees raised from seed locally would ultimately be more successful.</p><p>Overall the results of Reid's work were disappointing and as has often been the case with agricultural research in the Falkland Islands, Reid's work was subject to some criticism in LegCo. However not all the efforts of the Blake family and James Reid were wasted and Robert Blake (senior) wrote enthusiastically to the Director of Kew in February 1927. Stocktaking of young tree plants at Government House in January 1927 revealed that there were 30,108 plants, and it was decided to dispose of them to the public. About 4,000 plants were given away.</p><p>Middleton's successor, Governor <a href=\"/biographies/hodson_sir\">HODSON</a>, was not sympathetic to the work of the forestry officer and Reid's contract was not renewed; he returned to Scotland and took up an appointment at the Royal Botanic Garden in Edinburgh. An account of Reid's work in the Kew Gardens Bulletin in 1927 noted:</p><blockquote><blockquote>The results so far obtained, both negative and positive, are a distinct advance in the problems connected with afforestation in these Islands. It is to be hoped that the work initiated during Mr. Reid's term of office will be continued, as there is a good indication now that so many of difficulties have been appreciated that a certain measure of success will be obtained.</blockquote></blockquote><p>On his return from the Falklands, Reid was probably appointed as head forester at Galloway House, in South West Scotland. In 1929 he moved to Meikleour House, Perthshire - home of the Marquis of Lansdowne - a prestigious appointment. No further details for Reid are known at present, but records show that references to him cease around 1960.</p>",

        "body": "<p>governor and sculptor, was born in Phantassie, East Lothian, son of George Rennie, agriculturalist and nephew of John Rennie the well known engineer. He studied sculpture in Rome and on his return to London in 1828 he exhibited at the Royal Academy and with the Society of British Artists. He worked on narrative subjects ( <em>The Gleaner, The Minstrel </em>) and portrait busts of his contemporaries in a classical style. In the 1830s he devoted his attention to improving the state of the arts in England and in 1836 he suggested the formation of a parliamentary committee which led to the establishment of the School of Design at Somerset House. He also worked to obtain public access to museums, suggested bringing Cleopatra's needle to London and in 1839 submitted an (unsuccessful) design for the national memorial to Admiral Nelson in Trafalgar Square.</p><p>In July 1841 he was elected as Liberal MP for Ipswich, but held the seat for less than a year as his election was declared void in May 1842. He stood again for Ipswich at the general election of 1847, but was induced to withdraw by the government fixer, Tufnell, to make way for another candidate. Rennie pressed the government to find him a colonial governorship in exchange for his help and eventually Lord Stanley, the secretary of state for the colonies, appointed him governor of the Falkland Islands on 15 December 1847.</p><p><strong>Governor </strong></p><p>Rennie, accompanied by his wife Jane and his three sons, George, William Hepburn and Richard Temple arrived in Stanley on 27 June 1848 in the naval transport  <em>Nautilus </em>after a voyage of four months. His predecessor Richard <a href=\"/biographies/moody_richard\">MOODY</a> left for home on 15 July. Rennie proved a competent administrator and the Colonial Office noted an improvement in the colony's accounts. He set about establishing a garden and bought a cow for milk and butter, a General Improvement Society was formed and after its first show in April 1849 Rennie was able to report that 'every useful kind of green crop or garden produce can be raised'. Indeed on 30 July 1849, the governor was able to cease the monthly distribution of rations, which had been a feature of the early days of the colony.</p><p><strong>The Growing Economy</strong></p><p>In October 1849 the military <a href=\"/biographies/pensioners_the\">PENSIONERS</a> arrived with their families and were allocated land and housing. The population of the colony increased substantially and the 1851 census showed a total of 383. A boost to the economy was the discovery of gold in California in 1849 and in Australia in 1850, leading to a surge of traffic along the sea lanes round Cape Horn. The number of vessels calling at Stanley rose from 12 (totalling 9,200 tons) in 1849 to 55 (totalling 24,000 tons) in 1855. The possibilities for the sale of meat, fresh vegetables and water increased in proportion. The demand for carpenters, shipwrights and other craftsmen was acute and their wages reached levels which scandalised ships captains and merchants. The prefabricated iron lighthouse was constructed on Cape Pembroke in 1854 and lit for the first time before Rennie returned home.</p><p>The main player in the Islands' economy also took shape during Rennie's time. The brothers Samuel <a href=\"/biographies/lafone_samuel\">LAFONE</a> and Alexander <a href=\"/biographies/lafone_alexander\">LAFONE</a> had signed an agreement with government to slaughter the wild cattle on the broad acres assigned to them. The Lafones never visited the Islands, but their manager, Richard Almond <a href=\"/biographies/williams_richard\">WILLIAMS</a>, was an abrasive character little inhibited by laws or agreements. He imported large numbers of gauchos from Montevideo without respecting the Aliens Act and discharged them at the end of the season without a fare home. The purchase of Lafone interests by the London-based Falkland Islands Company in 1851 improved matters. Samuel Lafone appointed John Pownall <a href=\"/biographies/dale_john\">DALE</a> from Montevideo as manager and he arrived in July 1852: his relations with Rennie were amicable, but in 1854 he was replaced by Thomas <a href=\"/biographies/havers_thomas\">HAVERS</a> from London, a less co-operative figure.</p><p>The search for guano produced an unfortunate incident. Early in 1852, Rennie sailed in the barque  <em>Levenside </em>for New Island to collect samples to be sent to London for analysis (together with samples of fine sand for possible use in glass making). On her return, the  <em>Levenside </em>struck a submerged rock near Cape Pembroke and quickly sank. There were no casualties, but the ExCo minute book, which the colonial secretary had taken along to write up, was lost. Analysis of both the guano and the sand concluded that it would not be economic to develop them.</p><p>In 1852 work was started on the Exchange Building, a long single story construction with a handsome Italianate clock tower which was probably designed by Rennie himself. The building, completed in 1854, contained a market area and one end was used as the Anglican church. It dominated views of Stanley until the second peat slip in 1886 destroyed it.</p><p><strong>Personalities</strong></p><p>Rennie had chronic problems with his unbalanced colonial chaplain, James Leith <a href=\"/biographies/moody_james\">MOODY</a> and his shyster magistrate William Henry <a href=\"/biographies/moore_william\">MOORE</a>. He received less than wholehearted support from the Colonial Office. An official noted that in both cases: 'Governor Rennie showed very little scruple in getting rid of an officer he (perhaps with good reason) disliked by bringing very paltry charges against him'. In the end Moody took leave and did not return, while Moore revealed his true colours during leave in London and was forbidden to return. The next magistrate, Algernon <a href=\"/biographies/montagu_algernon\">MONTAGU</a>, was also a tricky character whom Rennie suspected of advising his opponents. Rennie was ably supported by the colonial secretary James <a href=\"/biographies/longden_sir\">LONGDEN</a> who provided continuity and a safe pair of hands. His son William Hepburn Rennie took on occasional tasks in government and acted as a magistrate during the case of the American whalers. It was the first rung in a career which would lead him to service in Hong Kong and finally to become lieutenant-governor of St Vincent in 1872.</p><p><strong>The Germantown Incident</strong></p><p>A serious international incident erupted in 1854. Rennie had reported the appointment of WH <a href=\"/biographies/smyley_william\">SMYLEY</a> as US commercial agent in Stanley in 1851. In February 1854 Rennie asked for naval support to arrest American whalers who had been shooting cattle for provisions, and Commander <a href=\"/biographies/boys_henry\">BOYS</a> was sent down from Río de Janeiro in the brig HMS  <em>Express </em>. But Smyley too had sent for support and the powerful frigate USS  <em>Germantown </em>(Captain LYNCH) arrived in Stanley harbour on 2 March to find HMS  <em>Express </em>escorting the delinquent American ships into the bay. An exchange of correspondence with the hot-tempered Lynch followed but Rennie was able to quote a note from the US Secretary of State, Marcy, who had warned American ships' masters and other citizens that if they committed spoliations in the Falklands, they would incur penalties. Lynch intimidated the courthouse with his ship's guns and while the whalers were found guilty, their fines were light.</p><p>The incident soured Rennie's relations with Smyley: the accredited agent of the United States, wrote the governor, was abetting the lawless acts of his countrymen. For his part the American denounced Rennie who 'has shown his inveterate hatred to me and all my countrymen'. Lynch reappeared in August 1854 to enquire into the arrest of another American captain, Bernsee of the barque  <em>Courier </em>. But Bernsee had been released and Lynch left without further incident.</p><p>The Crimean War (1845-6) caused some concern: the nightmare was a Russian privateer attacking the undefended colony. A volunteer force was raised.</p><p><strong>Return</strong></p><p>On 4 June 1855 Rennie wrote a strong plea to return home; public works in and around Stanley had been completed. The Colonial Office were sympathetic; they believed Rennie 'has shown energy and ability during the seven tedious years that he has administered the government of these remote islands'. In considering a new governor, one official noted: 'It is I believe admitted that Mr Rennie's administration and development of this small populace is deserving of commendation'. The government grant had fallen from £5,700 a year to £2,807.</p><p>Rennie left the Islands on the  <em>Java </em>, bound for Falmouth, on 5 November 1855. He was able to report: 'the Colony is abundantly supplied with all the necessaries and many of the luxuries of life...Labour is in good demand ... Pauperism is entirely unknown'. The population had risen to around 600 persons.</p><p>Rennie seems to have disappeared from public life after his return, though in 1858 he did apply without success for a governor's post in Moreton Bay {Brisbane} Australia. He died at home in York Terrace, Regent's Park, London on 22 March 1860.</p><p>Rennie was fortunate because two significant sources of income became available to the colony during his term as governor: the Falkland Islands Company and the ship supply and repair trade. But he provided safe and consistent government for his seven and a half years and saw the colony safely through the  <em>Germantown </em>crisis in 1854. On his departure many of the classic features of the colony had taken shape. The FIC was ensconced as the principal proprietor and substantial storekeeper, often in a state of tension with government. Other farmers had bought land on East (though not yet West) Falkland. The Patagonian Missionary Society had established their base on Keppel Island. Stanley Harbour was busy. Rennie, certainly the most artistic of Falklands governors, had handled his young and uncouth community with some skill.</p>",

In the mid ­l930s, his parents moved back to England with their five other children, leaving him in the Falklands with his grandparents. As a teenager, he worked as a Morse-code operator in the Post and Telecommunications Department and took an active part in the Boys' Brigade and in the Defence Force, and in sport. He was a crack rifle shot, who represented the Falkland Islands at Bisley, narrowly missing the Queen's Hundred.</p><p>Early in 1948. Richards found himself at Port Lockroy, Wiencke Island, in a four-man party under the leadership of George Barry, his other two companions being the Falkland Islander John <a href=\"/biographies/blyth_john\">BLYTH</a> and Ken Pawson, an adventurous young man responsible for a minor incident during their stay. Pawson had already taken Blyth - no mountaineer - on an ascent of the local snow-covered Jabet Peak (545m<em>) </em>and now planned to row in the base dinghy with Blyth and Richards the few miles to Doumer Island for a one-night visit. They reached Doumer Island safely but were then held there for several days by drifting ice. Meanwhile, Barry at the base was extremely worried, as the party carried no radio. He passed on his concern to Dr (later Sir) Vivian <a href=\"/biographies/fuchs_sir\">FUCHS</a>, the overall field commander based at Marguerite Bay, many miles to the south and powerless to assist. The three travellers eventually returned to the base after an absence of six days, following a change in sea-ice conditions.</p><p>Richards spent his second year in the Antarctic, 1949/50, at Deception Island under the able leadership of Gordon Stock, a veteran of the 1947/48 winter at the Argentine Islands.</p><p>In 1951 Richards married Thora Biggs, a Falklands girl, and in the same year they took up a two-year posting to the government station at Grytviken, South Georgia. In 1956 the couple followed the rest of his family to England. Richards then joined the Metropolitan Police, in which he rose steadily through the ranks to become chief superintendent of Greenwich Borough, controlling 'R' Division, before retiring in 1985.</p><p>During the Falklands War in 1982, Richards advised the Foreign and Commonwealth Office on possible landing sites for British forces, and he later made several journeys down to the Falklands to advise on reforming the local constabulary.

        "body": "<p>politician, was born on 17 February 1929, the younger son of the third Viscount Ridley and Ursula, daughter of Sir Edwin Lutyens the architect. He was educated at Eton and Balliol College Oxford, where he qualified as an engineer. He worked in this capacity for nine years before becoming Conservative Member of Parliament for Cirencester and Tewkesbury in 1959. From 1970 to 1972 he was parliamentary under-secretary of state at the Department of Trade and Industry and in 1979 he was promoted to minister of state at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, where his responsibilities included the Falkland Islands. Nicholas Ridley was staunchly Thatcherite and was known as a particularly undiplomatic operator. Fellow MP and contemporary at Eton, Tam Dalyell, described him as a man who was 'gratuitously confrontational', and who 'enjoyed being rude'. These were traits which he was to exhibit clearly and to unfortunate effect when he approached the issue of Falklands sovereignty.</p><p>Ridley had held a number of talks, public and private, with his Argentine opposite number Commodore Cavándoli. He saw the Falklands 'problem' as an issue that he could solve quickly. He had probably correctly assessed that it was approaching crisis point and needed action, but he was deeply mistaken in assuming that he could solve it by presenting the Falkland Islanders with a brisk and pragmatic proposal that took little account of their deeply-held desire to remain British. Islanders were already deeply suspicious of British policy towards them and Ridley's sudden arrival in Stanley on 22 November 1980 only reinforced their suspicions. When the minister finally revealed his plan, the mood in Stanley became almost violent. Unprecedented vitriol flowed between the minority who suggested Ridley's approach might be reasonable and the great majority who despised it.</p><p>At a public meeting in Stanley's Town Hall, Ridley stood on the stage and told hundreds of Islanders that he had three suggestions: a moratorium on the dispute; condominium; and 'leaseback'. Islanders could, he said, pick the one they liked, but he strongly advocated only one: leaseback. Moratorium, he said, would only freeze the issue ensuring it would be faced by future generations of Argentines, Islanders and British. Condominium (shared sovereignty) had been tried elsewhere and had been proven to be virtually unworkable. But leaseback had a real chance. Probably correctly, he suggested the Argentines would accept it. Titular sovereignty would be signed over to them, but the Islands would immediately be leased back to Britain, allowing British customs, government and the way of life to continue. Responding to Islanders hostility with typical lack of diplomacy, he accused them of maintaining a 'bellicose' attitude. This, he said, this could not go on.</p><p>His audience did indeed appear bellicose, but their bellicosity was directed at the British minister. It was clear that few in the Town Hall and throughout the Islands would accept leaseback. Ridley left Stanley Airport - ironically, aboard an aircraft of LADE, the Argentine Air Force airline - to the sound of furious demonstrators and the rare sight of normally rather supine Islanders waving banners and fists. LegCo discussed the issue, and reluctantly told the British Government that they could accept a moratorium. But this idea had only been included in the package to make leaseback more attractive and it was clear that Argentina would not entertain it. Ridley's mission had failed.</p><p>Back in the UK, the strong pro-Falklands lobby had been galvanised into action, and Ridley was savaged in a debate in the House of Commons on 2 December for his alleged treachery. This was not totally fair. Although a victim, like everyone else in the government, of poor intelligence which did not anticipate the Argentine invasion, he realised that something radical had to be done to defuse a problem of growing seriousness. He at least showed courage and tenacity in launching his leaseback initiative. If successful, it could have avoided a bloody war. As it was, talks with Argentina stuttered to a halt and in April 1982 Argentine forces attacked Port Stanley.</p><p>Ridley was moved to become financial secretary to the Treasury in 1981 and he remained there until 1983. He was secretary of state for Transport from 1983 to 1986, secretary of state for the Environment from 1986 to 1989, and secretary of state for Trade and Industry from 1989 to 1990. He was elevated to the Lords in 1992, becoming Baron Ridley of Liddesdale. In 1991 he wrote a widely respected autobiography, <em>My Style of Government - the Thatcher Years. </em></p><p>As a public person, Ridley did not care much about his image. He did not mince his words in media interviews. He launched and defended the hugely unpopular poll tax, saying 'why should a duke pay more than a dustman?' His ministerial career ended in resignation after a similar gaff. In an interview for the <em>Spectator </em>he described the European Community as 'a German racket designed to take over the whole of Europe'. But some colleagues had kind words for the maverick minister. He was, said some at the time of his death, respected and liked by his junior ministers and civil servants. He would, they said, give them credit for successes and shoulder the blame for failures.</p><p>Nicholas Ridley married the Honourable Clayre Campbell in 1950 and had three daughters. The marriage was dissolved in 1974 and he married Judy Kendall in 1979. A heavy smoker, he had been ill for some time when he died on 4 March 1993.</p>",

Indeed Captain Matthew <a href=\"/biographies/brisbane_matthew\">BRISBANE</a>, who had been appointed by Vernet to superintend his property, was paying the gauchos, not in currency, but in the pesos notes printed by Vernet, which William <a href=\"/biographies/dickson_william\">DICKSON</a>, the storekeeper, was reluctant to accept. Disgruntled, Rivero led an uprising against Brisbane on 26 August 1833. He gathered two other Argentine farm labourers and five Indians; their attack was swift and unexpected. Brisbane and four others were murdered (William Dickson, Juan <a href=\"/biographies/simon_jean\">SIMÓN</a>, Antony Wagner (trader) and Don Ventura Pasos). Their houses were ransacked and the contents destroyed. The remaining inhabitants fled Port Louis.</p><p>Over the six months that followed, the murderers lived at large in the Camp and the survivors, fearing for their lives, on islands in Berkeley Sound. Early in March 1834, Rivero and his band were tracked by a posse of marines and loyal gauchos. On about 3 March, Rivero, in the words of Lieut Henry SMITH's report: '... determined the following morning to betray his companions, and deliver the horses (fifty three), being his turn then to take care of them, which he accordingly did...' The murderers were brought back as prisoners to Port Louis. The eight miscreants were shipped to Río de Janeiro and held prisoner there for 12 months, awaiting a suitable occasion to transport them to England for trial. They arrived at Sheerness on board HMS <em>Snake </em>in May 1835.</p><p>Legal problems then arose as to whether the six remaining prisoners, none of whom was a British-born subject, could be tried and punished under British law for murder committed in a British overseas possession. As a result of the lack of clear definition in the legality of the case, the British legal authorities decided not to put them on trial. Accordingly, the four surviving prisoners were repatriated to South America. Rivero was released in Montevideo.</p><p>Rivero, it is claimed by some authors, died in the naval battle of Vuelta de Obligado on the Paraná River, which took place on 20 November 1845 between Argentina and Anglo-French forces.</p><p>Antonio Rivero became a national obsession under President Juan <a href=\"/biographies/peron_juan\">PERÓN</a>. He was hailed as a patriotic rebel against the 'usurping' British and became the object of a minor cult. However, some Argentine authors have since debunked this interpretation of history. None the less, during the occupation of the Falkland Islands in 1982, Port Stanley was briefly renamed Puerto Rivero in his honour, until it was realised that he was a less than suitable role model.</p>",

She was educated at a private school in Harrogate and was an accomplished linguist, fluent in German and French. Before her marriage in 1917 to Captain DW <a href=\"/biographies/roberts_david\">ROBERTS</a> she dealt with the foreign correspondence of several large firms and in 1918 was private secretary to the Rt Hon Sir Herbert Samuel MP during his election campaign.</p><p>She accompanied her husband to the Falkland Islands in 1921. During the 1920s she was editor of <em>The Penguin  </em>but resigned from that commitment in 1928. She also took a leading voluntary role as Islands secretary to the Girl Guides Local Association. Another activity was contributing to the local broadcasting service inaugurated in Port Stanley and on a temporary basis she assisted in the colonial secretary's office. Later she became fluent in Norwegian and was thus able to converse with Norwegian whaling captains calling in at Port Stanley. During World War II in Yorkshire she taught basic Norwegian to RAF crews liable to be shot down over Norway.</p><p>She was unquestionably the prime mover and founder of the Spinners' Weavers' and Dyers' Guild in the 1920s. An expert spinner herself, she had noted that wool was exported but that no one was using it locally. Then she realized that many ladies of Scottish origin, especially Hebridean, had spinning skills so she interested herself in forming the Guild. The Hebridean ladies knew about natural dyes so they collected <em>crotal </em>(Gaelic for lichen) from the rocks for dyeing purposes. Some had spinning wheels but more were needed so she obtained a verbal promise of financial support from Government and ordered spinning wheels from Norway to be brought out by a whaling factory ship. But when the wheels arrived there was some misunderstanding and Government money did not materialise. To overcome this difficulty coffee mornings, raffles, etc were organised and the problem was solved.</p><p>She and her husband had three children: Gerald Holgate <a href=\"/biographies/roberts_gerald\">ROBERTS</a> (b1923), David York Roberts (1924-2006 who became a commander in the Royal Navy) and Wensley Marjorie Roberts (b1926, who married Dr El-Hefni and now lives in the USA). Annis Roberts left the Falklands in 1931 with her children to educate them in the UK. When she returned in 1947 the Guild was still in existence and when she finally left the Colony in 1949 she received a scroll signed by the membership. In 1961 a letter to her, then in England, from Frances <a href=\"/biographies/creece_frances\">CREECE</a>, who had become president of the Guild recorded that members of the Guild were having difficulty keeping up with the demand for their work from the Royal Navy and other visitors. The Guild was also providing classes for senior pupils at the school and another generation of expert spinners was growing up. She died of a heart attack in Aberdeen in 1971.</p>",

He never married. At preparatory school he resolved to become an explorer and aged 18 at Uppingham School he put this in writing to the director of the Scott Polar Research Institute (SPRI), Cambridge. At Emmanuel College, Cambridge, he read Part 1 of the Geographical Tripos before turning to Archaeology and Anthropology. Much of his first two years was devoted to the Cambridge Bird Club. In 1932 he organized and led an expedition to Vatnajökull, Iceland, and the following year to Scoresbysund in East Greenland.</p><p>Joining the British Graham Land Expedition 1934-37 as ornithologist, he arrived in Stanley on 28 November 1934 in the expedition's ship <em>Penola </em>. Continuing south, he wintered with the ship at the expedition's base in the Argentine Islands before steaming to Marguerite Bay. After bouts of appendicitis he returned with the ship to the Falklands in early 1936, where his appendix was removed. <em>Penola </em>sailed to Grytviken in South Georgia for a refit during the winter, enabling Roberts to study Antarctic petrels and Elephant seals. In early 1937 he sailed south again with <em>Penola </em>to recover the second wintering party from Marguerite Bay.</p><p>When war broke out in 1939 he volunteered for the Navy, but defective eyesight prevented his appointment. After writing up his Antarctic work at the SPRI he was awarded a PhD on 5 June 1940 for a thesis on <em>The biology of some Antarctic birds. </em>From May 1940 he worked with Colin Bertram on a handbook on clothing and equipment required for cold climates. In February 1941 he was appointed to the Intelligence Division of the Admiralty to join a team producing geographical handbooks on Iceland, Spitzbergen and Greenland. This work was carried out at the SPRI, which had been taken over by the Intelligence Division.</p><p>In 1943 Roberts was involved with the start of Operation Tabarin<em>* </em>, the naval forerunner of the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey (FIDS). On 5 February 1944 he was appointed to the Foreign Office Research Department to work on polar political problems and to deal with planning and policy of the Falkland Islands Dependencies. With his appointment as part-time Research Fellow at the SPRI in January 1946 his life took on the pattern that was to continue until his retirement from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office at the end of 1975: three days per week in London and the remainder in Cambridge.</p><p>In November 1945 he was appointed Secretary of the UK Antarctic Place-names Committee. The official gazetteers for the British Antarctic Territory and the Falkland Islands Dependencies are a product of his work for this committee. Initially at the Foreign Office he was concerned with historical surveys of the Falkland Islands and Dependencies, and hence with territorial claims in the Antarctic, which provided the basic argument for continued British activity in the Antarctic in the years after World War II.</p><p>He advocated the expansion of scientific studies in Antarctica, and within the Foreign Office was able to ensure that the case for the continued support of FIDS (later the British Antarctic Survey) was put to Ministers. He sought and gained government support for the Norwegian-British-Swedish Antarctic Expedition of 1949-1952, and later visited the expedition's base <em>Maudheim </em>in Dronning Maud Land. Following the success of this expedition he advocated an air survey of the Falkland Islands Dependencies, which led to the Falkland Islands Dependencies Aerial Survey Expeditions of 1955-1957.</p><p>When the overlapping sovereignty claims of Argentina, Chile and the UK in the Antarctic Peninsula area threatened to disrupt scientific collaboration, Roberts advocated an international approach. No other individual was so fully involved in the drafting of the Antarctic Treaty in 1959 and the subsequent consultative meetings until his retirement in 1975. The Treaty led to the separation at 60° south latitude of the Falkland Islands Dependencies, which formerly extended to the South Pole, from British Antarctic Territory (all of it south of 60°S). This had the effect of reducing the land areas of the Falkland Islands and Dependencies to less than 1 per cent of their former extent.</p><p>Roberts made the major contribution to the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals which was signed in London and came into effect on 11 March 1978. He will be remembered in Antarctic Treaty affairs as a formidable yet pragmatic negotiator. He last visited the Falklands and British Antarctic stations in 1976. Roberts's lifelong work at SPRI concerned the organization of polar information and led to the publication of the <em>Universal decimal classification for use in polar libraries </em>, today a widely accepted library tool.</p><p>He was awarded the Polar Medal in 1939, a CMG in 1969 and the Founder's Medal of the Royal Geographical Society in 1976. He died in Cambridge on 9 October 1978. In his will, he left his entire polar library to the SPRI together with a substantial legacy. Probably nobody in his lifetime did more to further British interests and British achievements in the Antarctic. The SPRI library catalogue lists 134 publications under his name. He is commemorated in the names Roberts Ice Piedmont on Alexander Island and Robertskollen in Dronning Maud Land.</p>",

The family, who all spoke Welsh as their first language, came from farming stock in Cynwdd, near Corwen, North Wales. He was educated at a Board School in Bootle, Liverpool, and went to sea at an early age. He rounded Cape Horn several times in large sailing ships 'before the mast' and then as second mate of the full-rigged ship, <em>Neotsfield.  </em>He obtained his Certificate of Competency of a Foreign Going Ship on 24 June 1912. In July 1912 he joined the Pacific Steam Navigation Company (PSNC) as fourth officer in the <em>Orcoma.  </em>The last PSNC ship in which he served as chief officer, was the <em>Huanchaco. </em>He had from time to time called in at Port Stanley and during a voyage in the <em>Huanchaco  </em>he was persuaded by some sheep farmers, one of whom was Sydney Miller, father of Sydney <a href=\"/biographies/miller_sydney\">MILLER</a>, to apply for the post of marine superintendent of the FIC and to take command of RMS <em>Falkland.  </em>This he did in 1921 but because the <em>Falkland  </em>happened to be in Buenos Aires when he arrived at Stanley his actual first command for a short time was the FIC schooner <em>Gwendolin. </em></p><p>On 17 Nov 1917 he married Annis Marjorie Holgate. They had three children: (see AMH <a href=\"/biographies/roberts_annis\">ROBERTS)</a>. In 1931 Roberts took command of the FIC's newly built ship, the <em>Lafonia,  </em>later called <em>Fitzroy.  </em>In this and other FIC ships which he commanded he sailed round the Islands, often going to Montevideo, to Punta Arenas, sometimes to South Georgia and occasionally to southern Brazil. In 1935 he was elected to membership of the Honourable Company of Master Mariners in London.</p><p>From 1939 to 1949 he was colonial manager of the FIC in Stanley. In this capacity as well as being a master mariner he was of assistance to Commodore <a href=\"/biographies/harwood_sir\">HARWOOD</a> before and after the Battle of the River Plate in December 1939. He was a popular and successful manager and the Company and colony benefited from his maritime background. In 1943-5 he played a major role with the <em>Fitzroy  </em>in Operation Tabarin*, the setting up of bases which ensured the British presence in the Antarctic. He also ensured that <em>Fitzroy </em>, the colony's sole link with the outside world was not unduly hazarded during the operation. Tabarin became the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey after 1945 and later the British Antarctic Survey. Mount Roberts (3,133ft/955m)  on the Antarctic Peninsula commemorates his name. He was a member of LegCo and ExCo while he was manager of the FIC in Stanley and appointed to the Civil Division of the OBE in 1946 for public service and services in the Falklands during the war. He retired to the UK in 1949 and died at Aberdeen following a heart attack on 20 March 1970.</p>",

During World War I he was employed on building an anti-submarine boom across the English Channel, which involved a considerable amount of diving work.</p><p>He married Minnie Hodge in 1907 and their first child, Gordon, was born in Dover in 1912.</p><p>In 1921 the Admiralty despatched him to the Falkland Islands to build the oil storage tanks on the Camber across the water from Stanley. He and his wife arrived in the Islands with their three sons, Gordon, Bernard and Roy, on 17 January 1922, on the RMS <em>Orita </em>from Liverpool. During the course of his work for the Navy, Roberts made such a strong impression on Governor <a href=\"/biographies/middleton_sir\">MIDDLETON</a> that he was asked to take on the task of improving the sanitation, water supply and roads in Stanley. Roberts agreed and arranged to be seconded from the Admiralty to the Falkland Islands Government starting in 1925. The project was titled the 'Stanley Improvement Scheme' and Roberts became known locally as 'SIS' Roberts in tribute to his key role in the development. An energetic man, Roberts took on a raft of additional responsibilities: chief water authority 1927-1938, acting colonial engineer 1927, superintendent of the fire brigade 1928-1932, chairman of the board of health 1928-1938, colonial engineer 1928-1938. In 1929 he was elected to LegCo and from 1932-1938 to ExCo. From 1930-1938 he was director of public works and from 1937-1938 harbourmaster; he served as a Justice of the Peace from 1930-1938.</p><p>His achievements in construction were notable. He supervised the construction of the 1914 Battle Memorial, completed in July 1926 despite rough weather: 'the weather turned out pretty bad', he reported, 'but the men stuck to it and put out all their full horsepower ... To compensate the men I gave them all a good \"tot\".' He had been a careful manager, for the project came in appreciably under budget. He himself received an honorarium of £105.The memorial was unveiled on 26 February 1927, with HMS <em>Capetown </em>in the harbour.</p><p>His other Stanley landmark is the 1933 centenary memorial - the four whale bones on the green by the Cathedral. Roberts used two pairs of blue whale jawbones, sent to Government from the South Shetlands as a gift from the Hektor Whaling Company, and fastened them together with an iron cross, setting them over a cruciform seat. In addition he supervised the renewal of Matthew <a href=\"/biographies/brisbane_matthew\">BRISBANE</a>'s grave at Port Louis and in 1931 the laying of the foundation stone for the public swimming pool (which was not completed until 1992). Once walking on the hills near Stanley with his foreman, Roberts literally stumbled across a source of water, getting soaked but realising that he had found an additional supply for the town, which became the first piped water in Stanley. The site was named 'Roberts' Spring', by order of the Governor.</p><p>Besides his talents as an engineer, Roberts was an accomplished stamp designer and produced the designs for the 1933 centenary issue and the 1938-1949 pictorial definitive issue. He was a keen photographer, on one occasion taking 63 portraits in a single day. He also enjoyed listening to opera broadcasts from Buenos Aires on a short-wave radio given to him by Governor <a href=\"/biographies/henniker_heaton\">HENNIKER HEATON</a> in recognition of work carried out while Roberts was serving as harbourmaster in 1937. Mrs Roberts was highly regarded in Stanley, especially for her kindness to young nurses and teachers for whom she kept open house. The Roberts' eldest son, Gordon, worked in the Treasury, while the two younger ones were being educated in England, cared for by their grandmother in Kent.</p><p>In 1938 Roberts was awarded the Imperial Service Order in recognition of his work in the Falkland Islands. He retired to England later that year, departing from the Islands on the <em>Fitzroy </em>on 14 July with his wife and son. The <em>News Weekly </em>wrote on their departure:</p><blockquote><blockquote>We feel sure Mr. &amp; Mrs. Roberts and Gordon will take with them the best wishes of their many friends in the Falklands and be long spared to enjoy their well-earned rest. Mr. Roberts' cheery disposition and keen sense of humour will be greatly missed.</blockquote></blockquote><p>In retirement in Britain, the Roberts continued to play host to many Falkland Islanders on leave and always retained their interest in the Islands. George Roberts died on 25 March 1976.</p><p><a href=\"/biographies/ransom_frank\">See Image 272</a></p>",

He attended the Government school at Stanley until 1931 when he left Stanley in MV <em>La Paz </em>with his mother, brother and sister for further education in UK. At the age of six he suffered a tobogganing accident in Stanley, which left him with a lifelong limp. After attending King James's Grammar School at Knaresborough, Yorkshire, he went to Leeds University Dental School and qualified there as a dental surgeon in 1946 having also obtained the senior operative Prize in Operative Dental Surgery. In 1947 Roberts went for further training at the Dental Faculty, University of Toronto, and obtained the DDS of that University.</p><p>Thereafter he returned to the Falkland Islands to be colonial dentist for three years, 1947-1950<em>. </em>He presented a scheme based on operative clinical timings and transport times whereby every settlement could receive an annual dental visit and recommended that a second dentist should be recruited. After the Falklands tour of duty he returned to England to study orthodontics at the Institute of Dental Surgery, London, 1950-l 951.</p><p>In 1952 he married Sheila Catherine McLean, an Aberdeenshire farmer's daughter.

In 1953 he joined the hospital service of the National Health Service as a senior registrar at Edinburgh Dental Hospital and achieved consultant status, the first Falkland Islander to do so. His first consultant appointment, 1957—1960, involved taking part in a pilot scheme of the Ministry of Health to determine methods of provision of specialist oral surgery, orthodontic and other dental services in the hospital service. Thereafter he took up consultant appointments for Cumberland and then at the Royal Aberdeen Children's Hospital, where he was also honorary senior clinical lecturer in orthodontics at the University of Aberdeen. All these consultant posts involved giving general dental practitioners orthodontic advice or treatment for the patients they referred and provision of orthodontic services at regional peripheral clinics and for this his Falklands experience was of special value in Orkney and Shetland. In 1956 he invented the 'Roberts Retractor', an orthodontic appliance widely used. In 1964 he was awarded a Council of Europe scholarship to study children's dental and orthodontic services in Holland, Denmark, Sweden and Norway. He retired in 1983. His hobbies include watercolour painting, writing and carpentry; he has built a small cruising yacht and called it <em>Kelper.</em></p>",

In 1909 the family moved to Port Stephens (owned by WM DEAN) where Robertson's father had accepted the manager's position. Three years later, young Robertson was put into school at Dufftown, Scotland, returning home to Port Stephens at the age of 18. His parents had not seen him for six years. He served a cadetship and assisted his father with farm duties. Another two year cadetship was spent at 'Chymenaike', WM Dean's farm at Río Gallegos in Argentina.</p><p>In 1926 Robertson set off on the long sea voyage to Australia to gain more knowledge of sheep farming. He spent a season in New Zealand, working in various wool classing and sorting jobs to gain experience in wool handling. Returning to Australia, he was employed as a jackaroo at Widgiewa, a sheep sub-station in NSW owned and managed by the Falkiner family, world famous for their stud merino sheep. During his time there, he met Anne Chave who was employed as a schoolteacher at another Falkiner property. The couple married in January 1929 at St. Andrews Church, Sydney and then left for the Falklands. Back in Port Stephens, the next few years were taken up with the births of their two sons, James <a href=\"/biographies/robertson_james\">ROBERTSON</a> (b1931) and Peter (b1933). In the meantime Robertson had resumed his assistant manager's position later becoming manager in 1934 when his parents retired and moved into Stanley. He was appointed a Justice of the Peace in 1936 by Governor <a href=\"/biographies/henniker_heaton\">HENNIKER HEATON</a>.</p><p>In 1945 Dean sold Port Stephens to the Falkland Islands Company, thus adding to their two earlier West Falkland acquisitions - Spring Point in 1938 and Fox Bay West in 1939. Robertson was appointed West Camp manager and in the same year moved to Fox Bay West as manager including the Spring Point section which had been integrated earlier. Tom <a href=\"/biographies/beaty_thomas\">BEATY</a> took over managing Port Stephens. TA <a href=\"/biographies/gilruth_thomas\">GILRUTH</a>, as the first Falkland Islands Company manager at Fox Bay West, moved to the East Falklands. In the 1950s Robertson also took on a supervisory role for John Hamilton Estates requiring periodic visits to Weddell, Beaver and Saunders Islands. He generally assisted and advised the respective managers on farm matters and dispatched reports as required to the overseas owners.</p><p>In 1960, the Robertsons retired and moved into Stanley. Robertson kept himself occupied with essential house renovations and occasional Camp trips to the islands in his Hamilton Estates role. He served for several years as secretary for the Stanley Sports Associations annual Sheep Dog Trials. In 1974, Robertson's wife Anne died in Port Stanley. Then in early 1981 he decided to visit family and friends in Australia taking advantage of the newly opened southern air route. Some months later he collapsed while on a day's outing to a sheep farm and passed away in Goulburn Base Hospital, NSW on December 5, 1981.</p><p>Robertson spent virtually all of his working life at Port Stephens and Fox Bay West. The greater part was in an era when all means of transport was confined to horsepower. He was very knowledgeable in the ways of the Camp and a highly respected stockman. He was a tall man, generally easygoing with a good sense of humour, forthright when his patience was tested and a fine storyteller especially of old-time Camp life. Robertson related well with his contemporaries and farm workers and had a keen interest in and extensive knowledge of local family histories and backgrounds. A keen judge of horses as well as a master sheepdog trainer, he won many local competitions at annual sports meetings. Along with his son Peter and a few others, he had the distinction of competing in Stanley Sheep Dog Trials Exhibition to mark the Duke of <a href=\"/biographies/edinburgh_the\">EDINBURGH</a>'s visit to the Falkland Islands in 1957. Robertson was a valuable member and contributor to the farming community during his working life and was responsible in the latter part for the essential upgrading and development of Fox Bay West.</p>",

He worked for Nelson Bros Freezing Company in Blenheim prior to his departure for the Falkland Islands. He arrived at Stanley in September 1895 on the SS <em>Abydos </em>. Robertson had been engaged by the Falkland Islands government as an assistant inspector of stock for their sheep scab eradication programme. Also on board the ship were New Zealanders John Kennedy, another assistant inspector, and John Tindale Mowat and family. Mowat a stockman/woolbuyer had been chosen by government as the first FIG stock inspector for his experience clearing scab in New Zealand and California. However he was so unimpressed by and indeed scathing of Falkland farming practices and the poor quality sheep that he and his family left the Islands after just over a year, recommending that New Zealand bred Romney Marsh stock be introduced.</p><p>Robertson was appointed acting chief inspector on Mowat's departure and was confirmed in the post in early 1897. John Kennedy was his assistant. The first shipment of 500 New Zealand Romney Marsh ewes and rams arrived in the Falklands in 1896. Further shipments followed during the next 20 years.</p><p>In 1898 Robertson married Theresa Louisa Carey.

In 1934, his grandfather retired and his father took over as farm manager. At ten he attended the government school in Stanley and in mid 1944 he and his brother Peter entered St George's College, a boys' boarding school in the suburbs of Buenos Aires. After leaving school in December 1948 he signed up for a three year cadetship at Darwin with the Falkland Islands Company.</p><p>In the spring of 1953, Tom <a href=\"/biographies/beaty_thomas\">BEATY</a>, manager at Port Stephens, was on overseas leave and unexpectedly decided not to return, so Robertson was sent to run the farm for the forthcoming season. At the end of his cadetship he travelled with his parents to Australia on their leave in April 1954 to meet relations and gained some farm experience there. In 1957 he accepted an offer from the FIC as assistant to the camp manager, Tom <a href=\"/biographies/gilruth_thomas\">GILRUTH</a>, at Goose Green. The new position proved interesting, and varied and for the next two and a half years he made many visits to the Company's farms and islands in the Falkland Sound, regularly visiting Lively Island. He travelled twice to Punta Arenas, Chile, to buy horses for Company farms and clients.</p><p>In June 1958 he married Robin Amadio from Sydney, at Christ Church Cathedral, Stanley and moved into the Old Doctor's house (now The Pond House) at Darwin Harbour. They had three children: Kim (b1959), Jaime (b1960) and Gina (b1965).</p><p>Robertson succeeded his father as manager at Fox Bay West in March 1960. From the mid 1960s at Fox Bay West several seasons were devoted to grasslands trials over selected areas by rotavating and sowing Yorkshire Fog seed which produced mixed results, indicating the need for further research and trials. More encouraging was a fencing programme of subdivision and initial attempts to devise a system of rotational grazing for the farm. Sheep keds* were completely eradicated in the early 1970's and measures taken to combat the hydatid* problem. A fire in the manager's house at Fox Bay West in 1968 was a devasting loss to the farm and family.</p><p>Confronted rather prematurely with the decision of retirement, he stood down as manager in 1980 and the family left for Australia. His working life within the Falklands, almost 30 years, was solely as an employee of the FIC, whom he highly respected. As a Kelper born and raised on a large sheep station he learnt the rudiments of local camp work and life at an early age and this stood him in good stead in his farming career.</p>",

He worked with the Ordnance Survey in 1837-8 and as a surveyor in Kent in 1839 and 1840 before going into practice with one Carrington.</p><p>Robinson joined Lieutenant-Governor Richard Clement MOODY's party which sailed for the Falkland Islands in October 1841 on board the <em>Hebe </em>and arrived in Port Louis on 15 January 1842. Moody later wrote that Robinson was the nephew of his former tutor - certainly he was the Governor's only social equal in the official group during their first years at Port Louis, and Moody appointed him his private secretary. Robinson surveyed Port Louis to a scale of 90 yards: 1 inch, and then produced a fine plan (now in the PRO Kew) for the settlement's development as the new town of Anson around a central diamond with a grid pattern of roads. Because of the move to Stanley, this plan was never carried through.</p><p>In January 1843 Moody sent him to Carmen on the Río Negro in Patagonia to secure horses and experienced gauchos for the colony. Robinson returned in March with 36 horses and two Indian gauchos and wrote a long report on the state of the Río Negro, which was forwarded to the Colonial Office in July. Robinson found the coastal settlements falling into decay though he was impressed by the horsemanship of their inhabitants and the quality of some of their livestock. He had carried out an important solo mission competently and in July, following some trouble with 'foreigners', Moody appointed him a Justice of the Peace, 'in case of any misfortune happening to myself'. Robinson surveyed Stanley prior to the transfer of the settlement in 1845 and then took a party to survey potential agricultural areas around Stanley and north of Choiseul Sound.</p><p>The arrival of Dr <a href=\"/biographies/hamblin_henry\">HAMBLIN</a> and his family in November 1843 changed the balance of personalities in the tiny community. Robinson was replaced as private secretary and clearly felt he was being excluded from his close relationship with the governor. In March 1845 he returned without permission from the rigours of surveying in Camp to be told that he was no longer needed as a JP. A furious row took place in Government House during which Robinson rejected Moody's reproofs and accused him of having called the doctor's wife a whore. This was too much: Moody sent him home advising him to set out 'axe in hand' for some other colony.</p><p>When Robinson reached London around September 1845 he was received with some sympathy at the Colonial Office and was appointed second assistant surveyor general at the Cape Colony, travelling to Capetown in 1846. He spent thirty years in South Africa, progressing upwards to first assistant surveyor, deputy civil engineer and deputy surveyor general for the Eastern Cape, deputy civil engineer for Cape Colony and in 1865 chief engineer of roads, bridges and buildings. During the 1850s he was primarily employed in surveying land taken from a Xhosa tribe on the eastern border of Cape Colony. He produced an ambitious design for Queenstown with a hexagonal place at its centre, perhaps with memories of Anson. During his later years Robinson supervised road-building across the Little Karroo Range into the interior of the Colony.</p><p>In 1850, he married Mary Anne Ebden, the daughter of John Bardwell Ebden, one of the earliest British settlers in the Cape. They had two daughters, Lucy Marianne (b1855) and Ethel Laura (b1860). Robinson was elected associate of the Institution of Civil Engineers (London) in 1861, and member in 1870. He retired in 1876 and returned to London. He died at his house in Philbeach Gardens SW on 25 January 1900, leaving an estate of £993 to his two - still unmarried - daughters.</p><p>Joseph Dalton <a href=\"/biographies/hooker_sir\">HOOKER</a> described Robinson as 'a most obliging little fellow' and he seems to have won the affection of many who met him. He clearly was an effective surveyor and blossomed as an engineer in the broad acres of the Cape. In the tiny society of 1840s Stanley though, he was too young, too impetuous, too vain (Moody would say) and too jealous of his close relationship with the governor to avoid a ruinous scene which made his position impossible.</p><p>The Murrell River near Stanley is named after him, as is Robinson Pass north of Mossel Bay in South Africa.</p>",

        "body": "<p>governor, was born on 14 January 1834, the fifth son of Admiral Hercules Robinson of Rosmead, Co Westmeath, by the only daughter and heir of Henry Widman Wood. After being educated at the Royal Naval School, New Cross, he entered the Colonial Service in 1855 as private secretary to his elder brother Sir Hercules Robinson, afterwards the first Baron Rosmead, who was then lieutenant-governor of St Kitts. In 1859, when his brother Hercules became governor of Hong Kong, William accompanied him there as private secretary.</p><p>On 7 April 1862, he married Olivia Edith Dean, daughter of Thomas Stewart Townsend, Bishop of Meath and that year was appointed president of Montserrat, being carried ashore on the back of the black coxswain of the boat that had brought him there and walking to his quarters in the capital town of Plymouth. From January to October 1865 he administered the government of Dominica, once having to face down an angry mob.</p><p>On 23 May 1866, Robinson was appointed to be governor of the Falkland Islands, arriving in the colony with his family on board the sloop <em>Spiteful,  </em>Captain AW Fletcher, on 24 June. His career was very nearly cut short soon after his arrival, when he fell into the water while landing at a jetty and almost drowned. He was rescued by William <a href=\"/biographies/coulson_william\">COULSON</a>, whom he rewarded with a government job.</p><p>The colony was still in the early stages of development. At the 1864 census the population was 662, including 53 aliens. The needs of visiting ships were a major source of income. Sheep farming on East Falkland showed promise of advancing with rapid strides but West Falkland still remained unsettled. There was no direct taxation although the colony still received 'grant in aid'.</p><p>Robinson's most significant achievement was the settlement of West Falkland. When he arrived, there was not one settler on the West but by 1868 he could inform the secretary of state (the Duke of Buckingham) that, not only was the whole of West Falkland now settled, but that the large islands of Weddell and Saunders had also been taken up. The governor visited West Falkland, calling in at Fox Bay and Port Howard during the summer of 1868/69 and commented in a letter to Louis <a href=\"/biographies/baillon_louis\">BAILLON</a> in England that, while the undertaking 'must necessarily be attended with many hardships and privations...the settlers on West Falkland in the end will be amply repaid for all they may have had to go through in the first instance'. The rents from the settlement of West Falkland almost doubled the local revenue to the Falkland Islands and set the colony on course to be self-financing within ten years.</p><p>Shipping calling at the Falkland Islands provided one of the chief sources of income at that time. Apart from supplying food, water and coal to the Cape Horner ships calling in at Port Stanley, there was a profitable business in repairing ships. The Governor reported that during 1866 fifteen vessels visited for repairs, twenty-five for water and provisions and thirty-one for ordinary purposes of trade. The wreck of the <em>Coquimbana  </em>proved to be, in the words of his despatch to London 'a case of great interest and importance'. The ship had gone aground on Tyssen Ground in Falkland Sound in May 1867 and the senior magistrate <a href=\"/biographies/griffiths_edward\">ER GRIFFITH</a> had backed the bench of magistrates in agreeing that her captain had the right to sell the cargo to Luis <a href=\"/biographies/piedra_buena\">PIEDRA BUENA</a>, as the ship was a wreck. Lloyds of London sent a representative to the Islands, Capt Miller, who appealed to Robinson. The governor used the presence of a naval ship in the harbour to ask Admiral Ramsay to send Captain <a href=\"/biographies/mayne_richard\">MAYNE</a> to look at the <em>Coquimbana. </em>Mayne pronounced the ship in no danger of breaking up and the governor reversed the court decision on appeal and ordered the goods to be restored to Miller for the owners. Miller's success 'will prove a death blow to a system which has in truth caused the name of the Falklands to become a by-word and a reproach in the shipping and mercantile worlds', claimed Robinson. The Colonial Office was impressed: 'the Governor seems to have dealt with this matter very skilfully...' minuted one official.</p><p>Although it was not until ten years later that the first Falkland Islands adhesive postage stamps were issued, it was during Robinson's time that the first Falkland Islands postal date stamp, first registration hand stamp and the small rectangular 'paid' mark, which was applied with a black inking pad and known to philatelists as the 'Black Frank', were ordered from the Crown Agents. All three appear on the earliest known 'Black Frank' cover dated 4 January 1869 which bears Robinson's initials and is possibly the first Falklands 'First Day Cover'.</p><p>Robinson found a high standard of living in the Falkland Islands. He wrote in the Blue Book for 1866: 'with wages so high and food in abundance the settlers are prosperous and contented. Poverty and distress are unknown, sickness rarely visits the Colony, the people are loyal, the laws are respected and harmony and good feeling prevail amongst all classes of Society'. It was therefore not surprising that towards the end of his tour of the Falkland Islands the governor suggested to ExCo that the time had come when the colony should contribute to its own support by direct taxation: possible suggestions were a house tax, an income tax, a horse tax and a tax on imported liquor. None was pursued.</p><p>In November 1867 Robinson requested 12 months leave for health reasons and to leave his wife and children at home: 'Having served in the tropics for 11 years ... I feel severely the continual cold of this place, where from year's end to year's end a warm day is a thing unknown'. Officials in London supported his request, adding: 'He is by far the best governor that we have ever had in the Falklands'. But the secretary of state was not prepared to leave the post vacant for so long.</p><p>A year later asking (unsuccessfully) for the government of Antigua, Robinson listed his achievements in Stanley: dealing with the cattle claims, improving the financial health of the colony, the West Falkland land settlement, the <em>Coquimbana  </em>case; and general social improvement. Robinson left the colony on 5 April 1870 in the corvette <em>Pylades, </em>Captain Buckley, in which his successor, Colonel <a href=\"/biographies/darcy_george\">D'ARCY</a> had arrived.</p><p>His next post was Prince Edward Island, where he succeeded in persuading the independent minded colonists to join a political union with the Dominion of Canada and was rewarded in 1873 with the CMG and appointed governor of Western Australia. In 1877 he was advanced to KCMG and appointed governor of the Straits Settlements. In 1878 Queen Victoria personally sent him to Bangkok on a special visit to invest the King of Siam with the GCMG, on which occasion Robinson was himself invested with the grand cross of the order of the Crown of Siam. In 1880 he was again appointed governor of Western Australia where he was successful in wiping out a debt of £80,000, leaving a balance of £32,000 in the Treasury. In 1883 he became governor of South Australia and was created GCMG in 1887. He finally served a third term as governor of Western Australia. After service in nine separate colonies Sir William Robinson retired from active service in 1895.</p><p>His other achievements lay in the field of music, which was the passion of his life. He was a composer of some note, a patron of numerous societies, besides lending his active support to various composers including Heuzenroeder, Julius Herz and Marshall-Hall. Having written part songs and pieces for military bands in London under the nom de plume 'Owen Hope', he composed several well-known and successful songs in Australia and a two act comic opera <em>Nut Brown Maid </em>. While in the Falklands he composed the music for a burlesque called <em>Villikins and his Dinah </em>which was performed in 'the theatre' in Stanley in October 1868 with FE <a href=\"/biographies/cobb_frederick\">COBB</a> as Villikins and George <a href=\"/biographies/travis_george\">TRAVIS</a> as Dinah.</p><p>Sir William Robinson died aged 63 at his home in South Kensington on 2 May 1897 after a severe throat infection. He was the only one of the early governors who arrived as a professional with wide experience of colonial administration, and his was a very successful term.</p>",

        "body": "<p>Argentine president, was born in Tucuman in 1843, the fourth son of Don José Segundo Roca and Agustina, née Paz. He entered the Colegio Nacional in Concepcion del Uruguay (which is in Argentina) in 1852 and the next year obtained a commission in the army of the Argentine Confederation. He had a successful military career in wars in the 1850s between the Confederation and the forces of Buenos Aires and in the War of the Triple Alliance (1865-1870) when Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil were united against Paraguay. He commanded government forces in the so-called <em>Campaña del Desierto </em>, or Desert Campaign of 1877 to 1884 when the army, equipped with the famous Remington breach loading rifle, slaughtered the Patagonian Indians, killing between 50 and 60,000 and cleared the south for colonisation.</p><p>As minister of war for President Avellaneda, Roca was also responsible for sending Argentine forces to occupy Santa Cruz (which is directly opposite the Falklands) after a Chilean warship had seized the American ship <em>Devonshire </em>there, so ending Chilean claims to what is now Argentine Patagonia. With the Indians no longer around to impede Argentine expansion southward, and the Chileans pushed back to the Straits of Magellan, Argentina was left controlling the mainland opposite the Falkland Islands. In 1880, Roca, popular because of his victory over the Indians, was elected president and in January 1884 he resurrected the Argentine claim on the United States for the damage done by the USS <em>Lexington </em>(Captain <a href=\"/biographies/duncan_silas\">DUNCAN)</a> in 1831 and 1832 to <a href=\"/biographies/vernet_louis\">VERNET</a>'s tiny settlement in the Falklands. This claim was linked to the ownership of the Falklands, because if the American case that the Islands were not Argentine were admitted, obviously there could be no claim for damages.</p><p>The British minister at Buenos Aires, Edward Monson, had been warned in 1884 that Argentina intended to round off her territory. The Argentine Geographical Institute - supposedly independently - included the Falklands in an Atlas of Argentina it was preparing in the same year. When news that the atlas included the Falklands was publicised in December 1884, Britain made a diplomatic protest, leading to the so-called 'Affair of the Map' - an exchange of diplomatic notes over the next four years. This atlas and the exchange of notes resurrected the Argentine claim to the Falklands which had effectively been relinquished by <a href=\"/biographies/rosas_juan\">ROSAS</a> thirty-five years earlier with the 1849 Convention of Settlement.</p><p>Roca was re-elected President for another term from 1898 to 1904. During this period there was very serious tension with Chile over the boundary around the Strait of Magellan. To stave off the threat of war, Roca travelled to Punta Arenas in February 1899 to meet the Chilean President Federico Errazuriz. The two presidents made peace and King Edward VII of Britain was invited to arbitrate on their territorial disagreements. In November of 1902, King Edward's decision brought peace to the area for another seventy years, until the Beagle Channel dispute in the 1970s.</p><p>In 1872, Roca met his future wife Clara Funes and from that union there were five daughters and a son. He took little part in public life after his second term as President. On 19 October 1914 he died on his estate, 'La Argentina'. He had been a remarkable soldier and statesman, though something of a despot too. He was nicknamed <em>zorro  </em>or <em>zorrito </em>- 'the fox'- because of his cunning and ability. He made a major contribution towards the Argentina we know today - and his actions revived the Falklands dispute.</p>",

        "body": " <p>discoverer of South Georgia, was born in London, the son of a French father. The sole authority for his discovery is a book by the Spanish historian Francisco Seixas y Lovera:  <em>Descripción Geográfica y Derrotero de la Región Austral Magallanica.  </em>Published in Madrid in 1690, it is based on: 'the description given by La Roché, privately printed in London, in twelve sheets bound in quarto, in the year 1678, and in the French language'. An extensive search has been made for this pamphlet, without success. In 1769 Alexander Dalrymple, an influential chart publisher and historian, published a chart of the South Atlantic, partly based on Seixas's account, on which he depicted la Roché's track and, close to the present position of South Georgia, 'Strait de la Roché', between a small island and a land mass, taken from a map by the Flemish mapmaker Abraham Ortelius in 1586. In an accompanying memoir, Dalrymple described how la Roché, returning from a trading voyage to Peru had been blown eastward from Cape Horn by high winds until he discovered land in April 1675. Here la Roché found shelter in a bay where he remained for fourteen days in sight of snow-covered mountains. The bay is possibly Drygalski Fjord. Dalrymple added that land was also seen in this vicinity in 1756 by the <em>León </em>, a Spanish merchant ship, commanded by Gregorio Jerez. She had been carried eastward from Cape Horn in a storm during a voyage from Valparaiso to Spain and had sighted a small island and then more extensive land in 54°50'S, which corresponds with the latitude of South Georgia. <a href=\"/biographies/cook_james\">COOK</a> had Dalrymple's chart and memoir on board the  <em>Resolution </em>during his second voyage, which encouraged him to search for la Roché's Strait, resulting in his rediscovery of South Georgia.</p><p>Further details of la Roché's voyage, taken from Seixas's account were published in 1813 by Captain James Burney in his authoritative  <em>A Chronological History of the Discoveries in the South Seas </em>, published in five volumes between 1803 and 1817. La Roché sailed from Hamburg in 1674 in a vessel of 350 tons, accompanied by a bilander (a small two-masted merchant vessel) of 50 tons. On his return voyage la Roché called at the island of Chiloe to careen the two vessels and to take on provisions for their return to Europe. After the discovery of land, now identified as South Georgia, la Roché, according to his track on Dalrymple's chart steered due north and 'discovered' in 45°S a very large and pleasant island, where he remained for six days before continuing his voyage to Rochelle, where he arrived on 29 September 1675. This island, named Isla Grande and depicted on charts for many years, does not however exist. Burney points out the difficulties, conjectures and doubts which have arisen respecting la Roché's discoveries. Rupert Gould, a naval historian, in discussing the mystery of Isla Grande in 1928, pointed out that it was not necessary to write la Roché down as a liar, since he may have thought quite sincerely that he had discovered a new island when he had in fact encountered a part of the South American mainland, where in approximately 45° there are two projecting headlands which could easily be mistaken for an island. If this was the case, then la Roché's longitude was considerably in error, which leads one to question the authenticity of his discovery of South Georgia.</p><p>The highest peak on Bird Island, off the north-west tip of South Georgia, was named Roché Peak by the United Kingdom Antarctic Place-Names Committee in 1960.</p>",

He left for the then Belgian Congo in 1946 (from whence he had to withdraw during the troubles of 1964) after having served in a number of different locations in the Bansakusu Mission.</p><p>In 1965 Roel was appointed to the Prefecture of the Falkland Islands where he ministered until 1971. His moment of fame as a mediator came on 28 September 1966 when an Aerolineas Argentinas DC4 flight was hijacked by the <a href=\"/biographies/condor_group\">CONDOR</a> Group and forced to land at Stanley Racecourse.

He arranged the installation of a new east window in St Mary's church with a star motif (St Mary's was also known as 'Star of the Sea') using some Victorian coloured glass which had been stored at Government House. He started a small monthly family magazine, the <em>St Mary's Herald </em>, which was produced monthly on a roneo machine and sold for sixpence. He is fondly remembered by the Argentine historian and Baptist minister Dr Arnoldo Canclini, who was invited by the Rev Peter <a href=\"/biographies/millam_peter\">MILLAM</a> to preach at Stanley Cathedral. Canclini recalled that Roel 'was the first person I met in 1967 as he went aboard the ship and took my bags down. Afterwards I found him when the Governor invited me (and him) to lunch.

        "body": "<p>Argentine dictator, was born in Buenos Aires on 30 March 1793, the eldest son of León Ortiz de Rosas and Augustina López de Osornio. From a wealthy landowning family, Rosas was noted in the young Argentina for his leadership and personal bravery and during the 1820s he built up what amounted to a private gaucho army.  He championed the Federalist cause, and the trigger for his ascent to power was the failed coup by Unitarian General Juan Lavalle in December 1828. Rosas became governor of Buenos Aires in December 1829. He favoured the British and, in the stability he imposed, British merchants in Buenos Aires were able to develop their business interests. At the end of his term in 1832, Rosas declined to continue as governor, and Buenos Aires rapidly returned to strife. In 1835 the Assembly of Representatives granted him the full powers he demanded and he enjoyed 17 years of absolute rule as a dictator, while his gang of gaucho cutthroats, known as the <em>Mazorca </em>, simply murdered any opponents. The reassertion of British sovereignty over the Falkland Islands in 1833, when one of Rosas's rivals was in power, aroused some brief anger in Buenos Aires but was overshadowed by the general civil disorder.</p><p>Rosas himself was not much concerned over the Falklands, although at intervals he protested at the British occupation. However, in 1838, he proposed to exchange Argentina's claim to the Falklands for cancellation of the remaining part of the loan for one million pounds sterling from Baring Brothers of London. This had been contracted in 1824 to modernise the city of Buenos Aires. In January 1839, Manuel Moreno, the Argentine minister in London, on behalf of his government, sounded out the British government on Rosas's idea, apparently without success. Rosas also had his idea put to Franck de Pallacieu Falconet, the Barings emissary sent to Buenos Aires in 1842 to try to restart payments on the loan, and also instructed Manuel Moreno to raise the matter again then in London - with the same result. Foreign Secretary Lord Aberdeen turned it down (See Manuel <a href=\"/biographies/moreno_manuel\">MORENO</a>).</p><p>The problem of Uruguay brought Rosas into conflict with Britain and in 1845 a combined French and British fleet broke the blockade which Rosas had set up on the Parana river at the Vuelta de Obligado, to isolate rebel provinces in the north plus the province of Paraguay, which was seceding from Argentina. But it was through the treaty ending the Anglo-French intervention that Rosas is most significant to the Falklands. Before peace between Britain and Argentina could be formalised, Rosas wanted an agreement to boost his own position, recognise Argentine sovereignty over the Parana, and vindicate his decision to blockade it, which had cost him so many men. So he held out for a formal settlement and, in 1849, Argentina signed a Convention of Settlement. This declared \"perfect friendship\" and ended British intervention in the River Plate area. Although the convention did not mention the Falklands, it effectively ended the Falklands dispute too. With that treaty, all protests from Argentina over the Falklands ceased for the next 35 years. In 1850, Britain ratified the 1849 Convention, and Argentina acquiesced in British occupation of the Islands.</p><p>Several historians maintain that the 1849 Treaty was meant to include the Falklands. The Mexican Carlos Pereyra in his book <em>Rosas y Thiers. La Diplomacia Europea en el Río de la Plata 1838 - 1856 </em>  (published 1919) believes that Rosas wanted to use the Falklands to purchase Britain's departure from River Plate affairs. He gives seven final 'bases for the treaty' and adds an eighth: '(Unwritten) England retains the Malvinas Islands'. The Argentine historian Alfredo R Burnet-Merlin in his book <em>Cuando Rosas Quiso Ser Ingles </em>(When Rosas wanted to be English), suggests that the omission of any reference to the Falklands in the 1849 Treaty could be considered a secret renunciation of the Islands. Complete silence followed for 35 years, until President <a href=\"/biographies/roca_julio\">ROCA</a> revived the Argentine claim in 1884, with the 'Affair of the Map'.</p><p>Rosas was driven from power in February 1852 and was taken on a British warship into self-imposed exile in Britain. He lived in and near Southampton. Rosas died on 14 March 1877. He was buried in the Old Cemetery, Southampton, but his remains were returned to Argentina in 1990 and now lie in the family tomb in the Recoletta Cemetery, Buenos Aires.</p>",

        "body": "<p>rear admiral, Arctic and Antarctic navigator, was born in Finsbury Square, London, on 15 April 1800, son of George Ross and Christian, née Clark. George Ross, originally from Wigtonshire, traded as a 'Wine, Brandy and Porter Merchant'. One of three brothers and two sisters, the young James Clark Ross, along with his brothers, was educated as a boarder at Chislehurst Academy.</p><p><strong>The North West Passage</strong></p><p>On 5 April 1812, ten days before his twelfth birthday, Ross entered the Royal Navy as a first-class volunteer and joined the  <em>Briseis </em>, a 10 gun sloop, under the command of his uncle, Commander John Ross. Ross followed his uncle to serve in the  <em>Actaeon </em>, a 16 gun sloop and the  <em>Driver </em>, an 18 gun sloop, seeing service during the Napoleonic Wars in the Baltic, White Sea, English Channel and the west coast of Scotland. The end of the Napoleonic Wars saw a British revival in Arctic exploration: particularly the search for a north-west passage from the Atlantic to the Pacific. In 1817 John Ross was appointed to command a two ship expedition to search for such a passage. Two hired whaling ships, the  <em>Isabella </em>commanded by John Ross, and the  <em>Alexander </em>, commanded by Lieutenant William Edward Parry, sailed from the Thames at the end of April, 1818. On board  <em>Isabella </em>was the eighteen-year-old midshipman James Clark Ross. This voyage was his introduction to polar exploration and to polar controversy. The controversy hinged on the claim by John Ross for the existence of a range of mountains, which he had named Croker's Mountains, blocking Lancaster Sound. The range does not exist.</p><p>The Royal Navy returned to the search for a north-west passage with the  <em>Hecla </em>and the  <em>Griper </em>in 1819-20, and the  <em>Fury </em>and the  <em>Griper </em>in 1821-23. Both expeditions being commanded by William Parry, with James Ross serving as midshipman aboard  <em>Hecla </em>and then  <em>Fury </em>. On 26 December 1822, whilst wintering in the Arctic, he was promoted to lieutenant. During 1824-25 Ross returned to the Arctic with the  <em>Hecla </em>and  <em>Fury </em>expedition, again commanded by William Parry, in the search for the still elusive passage with Ross serving as second lieutenant aboard  <em>Fury </em>. Ross's fifth Arctic expedition was in 1827 as second in command aboard  <em>Hecla </em>, again commanded by Parry, to Spitzbergen and an abortive attempt to reach the North Pole by dragging sledge-boats across the polar pack-ice. Parry calculated that they had reached 82°43'32'' on 22 July 1827 (a farthest north record that was to stand for nearly fifty years).</p><p>Ross's nine years with Parry had produced an officer with a remarkable grasp of terrestrial magnetism and natural history. To acknowledge this fact both the Linnean Society, in 1823, and the Royal Society, in 1828, elected him a fellow. In November 1827 Ross was promoted to commander only to find himself on half pay without a command. His uncle, now Captain John Ross, was in a similar position. John Ross had long taken an interest in steam propulsion, and in 1828 submitted to the Admiralty a plan for an Arctic expedition to search for a north-west passage with a steam vessel. The Admiralty, the gloss having faded from Arctic expeditions, turned him down. But waiting in the wings was Felix Booth, the maker of Booth's Gin, with an offer of £18,000 to finance such an expedition. John Ross provided £3,000 of his own money. The  <em>Victory </em>, an 85 ton paddle-steamer, was bought by John Ross in 1828, her freeboard raised, bringing her tonnage to 150, re-engined and fitted with new paddle-wheels which could be hoisted out of the water. Previous to her metamorphosis into a polar exploration vessel she had carried mail from Liverpool to the Isle of Man.  <em>Victory  </em>sailed from the Thames in May 1829 with John Ross commanding and James Clark Ross as his second-in-command. This small expedition spent four winters in the Arctic with James Ross making sledge journeys and mapping hundreds of miles of coastline. On 1 June 1831 he located the North Magnetic Pole on the west coast of the Boothia Peninsula at 70°5' 17''N and 96°46' 45''W. The  <em>Victory </em>was abandoned in May 1832 and they made a long march north to Fury Beach on Somerset Island where they established winter quarters constructed from wood and canvas and insulated by ice walls. This in turn was abandoned in the summer of 1833 and the party made their way north in three small boats into Lancaster Sound. Here, in a classic polar encounter, they were rescued by the  <em>Isabella </em>, returned to whaling, the same vessel in which the Ross duo had made their polar debut in 1818. Having been given up as lost the rescued expedition became the sensation of the year. John Ross was knighted and James Ross promoted to captain on 28 October 1834.</p><p>Following this promotion Ross was appointed to conduct the first magnetic survey of the British Isles with Captain Edward Sabine of the Royal Artillery, and Professor Humphrey Lloyd. This work lasted until 1838: but with Ross taking time off in 1836 to return to the Arctic with his first command, the <em>Cove </em>, to search for and attempt to rescue a number of whaling ships trapped by ice in the Davis Straits. Ross chose as his first-lieutenant Francis <a href=\"/biographies/crozier_francis\">CROZIER</a>, a fellow officer from Parry's voyages. The  <em>Cove </em>sailed from Hull on 6 January 1836 bound for the edge of the Arctic pack ice in the middle of winter. She returned to Hull on 31 August 1836 having survived the ferocious winter storms and gigantic seas of the North Atlantic. That she did so was in part due to Ross's superb seamanship and leadership. As one man wrote: 'The captain is, without exception, the finest officer I have met with, the most persevering indefatigable man you can imagine. He is perfectly idolized by everyone'. Ironically the rescue attempt was unneccessary as all but one of the whaling ships extricated themselves from the ice. Ross was offered a knighthood for his rescue attempt, but for unknown reasons declined it.</p><p>Ross returned to his magnetic survey of the British Isles measuring variation, dip, and force at fifty-eight stations. In July 1837 he was appointed chairman of the newly formed Admiralty Compass Committee constituted to look into the defective state of the magnetic compasses supplied to the Royal Navy. Edward Sabine was also a member of this committee. The names Ross and Sabine became inextricably linked together as proselytisers for the nineteenth-century 'Magnetic Crusade': a marshalling of international science to measure, worldwide, terrestrial magnetism. It was an idea which had been first mooted by Alexander von Humboldt.</p><p><strong>The Antarctic Expedition:  <em>Erebus </em>and  <em>Terror </em></strong></p><p>On 8 April 1839 Ross was appointed to command a two ship expedition to measure terrestrial magnetism in the southern hemisphere and to locate the south magnetic pole. The two vessels, the  <em>Erebus </em>and the  <em>Terror </em>were naval bomb vessels designed and built to lob very heavy mortar bombs at land installations. As such they were very heavily constructed and had been further strengthened for this voyage into the Antarctic. Ross commanded  <em>Erebus </em>and Francis Crozier  <em>Terror </em>. The two vessels, packed with stores and provisions for three years, sailed from England on 30 September 1839.</p><p>Before their arrival at the Falkland Islands the expedition had called at St Helena, Simonstown, Kerguelen Island, Tasmania, Auckland Islands, Campbell Island, Sydney and New Zealand. During all this time they had taken their terrestrial magnetic measurements and carried out the vital 'term day' measurements: observations taken on land at the exact time when other worldwide observers were taking theirs. They had also made significant geographical discoveries in the Antarctic by sailing through the pack-ice and discovering what is now known as the Ross Sea, the Ross Ice Shelf, an active volcano, which they named Mount Erebus, and Victoria Land. The south magnetic pole was found to be far inland and unreachable by sea. But Ross, having achieved a furthest north with Parry could now claim a furthest south.</p><p><strong>Arrival at the Falklands </strong></p><p>On 6 April 1842  <em>Erebus  </em>and  <em>Terror </em>sailed up Berkeley Sound of East Falkland and anchored off the Port Louis settlement, unseen by the inhabitants owing to thick fog. The next day Ross and Crozier went ashore to meet with the Falkland Island's lieutenant-governor, Lieutenant Richard Clement <a href=\"/biographies/moody_richard\">MOODY</a>, an army officer of the Royal Engineers. Moody, twenty-eight years old, was still settling into his position having only arrived in the islands on 15 January 1842. He told Ross that the settlers were on a short allowance of bread and flour as the supplies from Buenos Aires had not arrived. Ross also learnt that the settlers numbered about sixty souls, that fresh vegetables were in short supply, and that the government stock of cattle was so low that fresh beef for the 128 sailors aboard the two ships could only be issued on alternate days. Such blunt news, perhaps, soured this first meeting between Moody and Ross. Joseph <a href=\"/biographies/hooker_sir\">HOOKER</a>, the expedition's assistant-surgeon and botanist, who became great friends with Moody, having the run of his library, noted the animosity between the young army officer and the older naval officer. Ross, for his part, eased the settlement's lack of flour by supplying it from the ships. For Ross his pressing concerns were the supply of fresh beef, the repair of his ships, and the setting up of the magnetic observatory for the term day measurements. The supply of beef was solved by following the example of the Royal Navy's surveying ketch, the  <em>Arrow </em>. This was a unique way of hunting the island's wild cattle using dogs of a mongrel breed (mainly pointer diluted with Newfoundland, Dalmation, mastiff, bulldog and bull terrier genes) and fleet-footed seamen carrying knives. The dogs would bring down one of the cattle, usually a cow, which would then have the hamstrings cut on the hindlegs, followed by the throat. Ross offered to pay for this meat at the same rate as that paid by the settlers for meat bought from the government store.</p><p>Astronomical, meteorological and magnetic observatories were erected ashore and also two turf huts for the accommodation of the officers and men employed at the observatories. Ross was anxious to correct the discrepancies between the 1820 and 1822 magnetic measurements made by French navigators: Louis de <a href=\"/biographies/freycinet_louis-claude\">FREYCINET</a> of the  <em>Uranie </em>and Louis-Isidor <a href=\"/biographies/duperrey_louis\">DUPERREY</a> of the  <em>Coquille </em>. Observations started on 15 April with Ross and Crozier sleeping in hammocks in the observatory hut. The position of the magnetic observatory has been located at approximately 500 meters south of Port Louis farm and 200 meters east of the small graveyard. It is marked by a 15 centimetre white stone cube, marked with a triangle engraved on the top. Two tide gauge bench marks were also erected on the shore line close to the magnetic observatory. These are still visible.</p><p>Ross now turned his attention to his ice-damaged ships. A pier was built which could be used by the ships' boats at all states of the tide. A storehouse large enough to contain the entire contents of one ship was also constructed near to the pier. Pier and storehouse were finished by the middle of May. The  <em>Erebus </em>was emptied and then hove ashore at the top of the high tide on the morning of 25 May. Carpenters and men from both ships then set about repairing the ice damage to her hull, followed by the hull being recaulked. All repairs were completed in two days and  <em>Erebus </em>then shifted back to her mooring. The empty ship was then thoroughly aired and cleansed before the stores and provisions were brought back on board. The whole operation was finished by 7 June. The  <em>Terror </em>followed the same procedure: hove ashore on 22 June, back on her mooring by 25 June.</p><p>On 23 June HMS  <em>Carysfort </em>, commanded by Lord George Paulet, arrived in Berkeley Sound carrying stores, provisions and a replacement bowsprit for  <em>Erebus </em>. These had been ordered by Ross from the commander of the Royal Navy's South American station when the  <em>Arrow </em>, after five years surveying in the Falklands, had sailed for home via Río de Janeiro.  <em>Carysfort  </em>sailed on 7 July bound for the Pacific. By the end of July  <em>Erebus </em>and  <em>Terror </em>were both ready for sea but, as the magnetic experiments would not be completed until the beginning of September, Ross and Crozier, at the request of Moody, made a visit to Port William to assess the relative merits of Port William and Port Louis as the site for the chief settlement of the colony. Ross, the navy man, had no hesitation in recommending Port William over Port Louis, giving five reasons, all of them based on the convenience and access of Port William for sailing vessels; the only objection to Port William being the limited amount of land suitable for agriculture. But this was more than outweighed by the paramount fact that possession of the Islands was intimately connected with maritime affairs and this should be the prime factor for the move.</p><p>On 8 September 1842, intent upon more magnetic observations,  <em>Erebus  </em>and  <em>Terror </em>sailed for Tierra del Fuego. Left behind were an officer and assistants to monitor the Port Louis observatories. On 12 November, after a twelve hour beat up Berkeley Sound, they were anchored off Port Louis carrying with them about eight hundred saplings from Tierra del Fuego, mostly evergreen beech and deciduous beech, for planting at Port Louis. Preparations now began for their last season in the Antarctic. No hands could be spared for the cattle hunt and fresh beef from the government store was limited; but fishing and shooting parties were occasionally sent out, shag and penguin eggs collected. When the ships sailed on 17 December 1842 their rigging was hung with dead rabbits, geese, snipe, seal meat, quarters of veal and beef, and dried fish. Live sheep, pigs and piglets were berthed in boats, and tussock grass lay bundled on deck as fodder.</p><p><strong>Back in England</strong></p><p>Ross's third and last Antarctic voyage, into the Weddell Sea, proved exhausting, arduous and unpleasant. The expedition arrived back in England on 4 September 1843 after an absence of four years and five months. Here Ross received the Founder's Medal of the Royal Geographical Society and the Gold Medal of the Geographical Society of Paris for his Antarctic discoveries. In 1844 he was awarded a knighthood, and in 1845 received an honorary doctorate of common law from Oxford University.</p><p>On 18 October 1843 Ross married Anne, daughter of Thomas Coulman of Whitgift Hall, Goole, Yorkshire: but it was not until 1847 that Ross's account of the Antarctic voyage,  <em>A Voyage of Discovery and Research in the Southern and Antarctic Regions </em>(2 vols.) was published by John Murray. The publishing of the terrestrial magnetism observations took longer. Analysed by Edward Sabine, the reports and maps of variation, dip and intensity were published by the Royal Society in 1843, 1844, 1866 and the final summary in 1868.</p><p>It is claimed that a promise to his wife and her family to give up polar exploration was the reason for Ross refusing the command of a new expedition to search for the north-west passage with  <em>Erebus </em>and  <em>Terror </em>. The expedition sailed in 1845 under the command of Sir John Franklin (and with Crozier as captain of his old ship, the  <em>Terror) </em>, and vanished into the Arctic. In 1847 Ross volunteered to lead an expedition to search for the two lost ships. In 1848 he sailed with the  <em>Enterprise </em>and the  <em>Investigator </em>to spend his last winter in the Arctic; but he met with no success in the search, returning to England in November 1849.</p><p>Ross's last years were spent at Aston Abbotts, Buckinghamshire with his wife and children (James, Anne, Thomas, and Andrew), the expert to be consulted on polar matters, and in 1856 he was made a rear-admiral. The death of his wife, aged forty, from pleural pneumonia in 1857 proved a shock from which he never recovered and broken in spirit and health there is evidence that he became a heavy drinker. He died on 3 April 1862 and was buried with his wife at Aston Abbotts. A window of the church bears the inscription, 'To the glory of God and in memory of Rear Admiral Sir James Clark Ross and of Anne his wife'.</p><p>To his contemporaries Ross was 'the first scientific navigator of his country and of his age.' A striking figure, he was called 'the handsomest man in the Navy'. But he is best remembered today for his Antarctic discoveries and his name lives on in the Ross Sea, Ross Ice Shelf, and the Ross seal. His time in the Falklands was brief and perhaps his main monument can be said to be Stanley; for his advice to London was instrumental in having the colony's main settlement moved from Port Louis. The 'front road' in Stanley carries his name. The two tidal bench marks can still be seen at Port Louis, but the trees brought from Tierra del Fuego failed to survive predatory goats. Perhaps the great imponderable is the cause of the friction and bad feeling between Ross and Moody. Interservice rivalry? Age difference? Mutual antipathy? Ross, by the time of his arrival in the Falklands, had spent two and a half years bearing the total responsibility of an expedition that had sailed into one of the world's most inhospitable climates. He was physically and mentally exhausted. Compared to Tasmania, with its fresh fruits and vegetables, Government House parties and balls, grog-shops and inns, the Falklands must have come as a rude shock. Tasmania and its lieutenant-governor, Sir John Franklin, had received lavish praise from Ross. The Falklands and Moody received none.</p>",

        "body": "<p>American whaler, was born in Nantucket, Mass on 30 September 1750, son of Joseph Rotch, the foremost whaling merchant in the American colonies and Love Coffin, née Macy, daughter of two of Nantucket Island's oldest whaling families. An older brother, William, achieved international prominence as a whaling merchant in England, France and America. Francis Rotch, on the other hand, came of age with an inventive cast of mind, which led him to focus on improving the methods and implements used to catch whales and process whale oil. In 1765, the family moved to a harbourside village on the mainland which would grow to become New Bedford, home of America's largest whaling fleet. But before that could happen, the deteriorating relationship between Great Britain and its American colonies profoundly affected the established procedures of the whaling trade, as well as the lives of the Rotches. Under the established mercantile pattern of the time, Rotch vessels regularly carried sperm whale oil and spermaceti candles to London, their largest market. In the fall of 1773, two of these ships took on return cargoes of East India Company tea. Francis Rotch went to Boston to receive them, but Britain's newly imposed tax on tea aroused an assembly of patriots who in the guise of Mohawk Indians dumped the tea into the harbour. Responding to this 'Boston Tea Party', the royal governor of Massachusetts closed the port of Boston and set the stage for America's war for independence from British rule.</p><p>At this juncture, Rotch entered into partnership with Aaron Lopez, a highly successful merchant of Newport, Rhode Island, to explore ways to continue whaling at a time when Britain's navy ruled the seas. Their plan was bold, entailing the establishment of a base in the Falkland Islands from which to exploit recently discovered sperm whale grounds off the south-east coast of South America. It also assumed that arrangements could be made to send the oil directly to London for marketing by their agents. In the fall of 1775, six months after the War of Independence began, Rotch and Lopez assembled 16 whaling ships at Martha's Vineyard and sent them off to the Falklands. Rotch himself sailed for London to convince the British government of the benefits that would accrue from the venture and to obtain assurances of protection for the vessels from seizure and their crews from impressment. The London firm of Haley and Hopkins agreed to receive and market whatever oil might be taken. Writing to Lopez, Rotch later admitted that not everything had gone smoothly. In fact 'various unfortunate occurrences nearly defeated all of our purposes, the most material of which was the seizure of five of our vessels'. Taken off the Azores by the British Navy, the ships were sent to London, where 'by tedious application', Rotch managed to get them released. The <em>Minerva </em>, however, was unfit to go to sea and had to be sold, and the <em>Diana </em>too was found unfit.</p><p>Early in 1776, Rotch left for the Falklands in the <em>Nancy </em>, one of his two store ships. He took with him three whaling captains to fill vacancies which might have occurred in the fleet and remained in the Islands for 'many months,' later describing them as the 'happiest period of my life'. Returning to London in 1777, he left no records or accounts from which to judge the success or failure of his venture. The fact that he and Lopez sought protection agreements for 14 additional whaling ships suggests that whaling from the Falklands not only continued but may even have increased. On the other hand, a brief summary of the expedition written in 1826 by Francis's nephew, Thomas Rotch, concludes with the statement which reflects the family's view that 'after spending many months in the Islands without the least prospect of succeeding in the enterprise, Francis abandoned it, returned to England and wound up the concern with a total loss of the capital invested in it'.</p><p>Rotch spent much of his remaining life abroad, first in the London home of Mary Haley, now owner and manager of her late husband's firm, then in the French ports of Dunkirk, Lorient and Le Havre, where in return for French bounties, he and his brother William Rotch based their whaling ships, rather than subject their oil to the prohibitive tariff on foreign whale oil now in effect in Britain. When revolution came to France, Francis Rotch returned to New Bedford to spend the remaining years of an eventful life designing and patenting various devices to transform whaling - inventions which alas went unheeded. He married twice, to Deborah Fleeming and to Nancy Rotch, (a cousin aged 91 - surely a marriage of convenience to allow them to share a house) but had no children. He died on 20 May 1820 in New Bedford.</p>",

In June 1892, Governor <a href=\"/biographies/goldsworthy_sir\">GOLDSWORTHY</a> complained that Routledge's sentences were inadequate.

In November Goldsworthy wrote that the colonial secretary had 'identified himself with the sheep farmers and being in opposition to the Government, ie myself'. Goldsworthy wished to return on leave but was not prepared to leave Routledge in charge.

        "body": "<p>businessman and character, was born in Buenos Aires on 11 January 1896, the eldest of four children of Richard Lawson Rowe, originally from South Shields and his wife Maud Minnie, née Stant. He came to the Falklands in 1923, as auditor-in-charge of the business known as Estate Louis Williams, principally consisting of the Globe Store and the Globe Hotel. These had been founded by Charles Williams in the nineteenth century and passed to his son Louis <a href=\"/biographies/williams_louis\">WILLIAMS</a> who had died in 1913 leaving no heir. Since Louis' death the business had been under the control of his widow, Ada, who had appointed a local manager in Stanley before returning to Britain, the country of her birth, in 1915. After five years it became clear that all was not well with the business and Ada Williams travelled back to the Falklands with her sister Grace Bossingham, to investigate the problem. Rowe later wrote an account of his recruitment:</p><blockquote><blockquote>She appealed to her late husband's connections in Punta Arenas for guidance and assistance and the elder of her nephews, Carlos Curze Williams, with whom I had been friendly for about a year (he was a Chilean Barrister) sounded me on the subject of going to Port Stanley to investigate and make a report ... I being at the moment at a loose end ... and about to return to where I really belong, Buenos Aires ...When I later met Mrs.Williams I was pleasantly surprised. We were both guests at her nephew's flat in Punta Arenas and Mrs.Williams had an air of distinction ... I was given instructions from the family as to what I had to report on ... and Mrs.Williams and I travelled on a cargo vessel of the Pacific Steam Navigation Co. Ltd. to Port Stanley ... I made my report and ... agreed ... to take over the management of the business.</blockquote></blockquote><p>Rowe travelled back with Mrs Williams, on the ship MV  <em>La Paz </em>from Punta Arenas and they arrived in Stanley on 28 May 1923. He was now effectively general manager of Estate Louis Williams and adapted to life in the Falklands, while cultivating the eccentricities of style for which he became widely known. He was a founder member of the Colony Club in 1933 and the 'Suggestions' book is filled with peppery remarks signed 'EGR': 'I suggest that the peat recently available for the bar and billiard room fires is very, very poor and that it is absolutely necessary that better fires be kept up in both these rooms'. 'Where are the copies of Whittaker's Almanac?' 'Suggest that members before election should be vetted as to whether they have been instructed in the simple art of wiping their boots on the mats provided for this purpose'. He held very strong opinions on political matters, both international and domestic, and although he was never a member of LegCo or ExCo he frequently used the local newspaper to broadcast his views on the questions of the day. These usually appeared under the heading 'Globe Store' in the advertisement section of the paper.</p><p>The outbreak of World War II prompted a reflection on history:</p><blockquote><blockquote>The Germanic Tribes of the Baltic Seas stretching across to the Black Forest have again decided to break out, this time under the urge of a voluble nobody called Hitler. This is nothing new ... in the 3rd century as Goths ... they defeated the Roman Empire ... as Vandals they invaded Italy at least twice...150 years ago ... they robbed and dismembered Poland. They have now started again at their old game, War and PLUNDER, disregarding the march of civilization ... The world is utterly tired of Germanic bounce and with the British Empire and their ally France at the spear-head of our civilization there can be no doubts as to the result.</blockquote></blockquote><p>The end of the war heralded a return to domestic preoccupations and in 1945 the following announcement appeared in the  <em>Weekly News </em>:</p><blockquote><blockquote>Prior to the outbreak of War in 1939 we had the following 'permanent' advertisement in the Weekly News which we now bring to the notice of our customers and friends in the hope that it may some day bear fruit: 'We are of the opinion, in common with many other people and entities in the Falkland Islands, that the lack of roads in the Colony is a crying disgrace. This expression of our honest opinion on this subject will be permanently advertised in this journal until such time as the building of country roads is resumed'. <em>[Signed] </em>: Estate Louis Williams.</blockquote></blockquote><p>In 1948 Mrs Ada Williams and Miss Grace Bossingham, with whom Rowe had shared Waverley House, the old Williams family home in Stanley, left the Falklands to return to England. Both women died in 1950, Grace in May and Ada in October. By the terms of Ada Williams' will, of which Rowe was the sole executor, Rowe inherited 50% of the Estate Louis Williams property 'for his long service and kindness to me'. The remainder was to revert to him on the deaths of Mrs Williams' surviving siblings. In addition she specified that 'the business of Estate Louis Williams...shall never pass outside the full control of Mr. Rowe'. By 1970, after the deaths of the remaining two Bossingham sisters and a brother, Rowe owned the whole of the Falkland Islands property.</p><p>He maintained Waverley as a batchelor establishment, with a series of housekeepers, cooks and maids to carry out the domestic duties. However he enjoyed ceremonially dispensing hospitality and as well as occasionally having friends to stay, would host rather formal gatherings. He entertained with some magnificence. Where other people put silver sixpences in their Christmas puddings, Mr Rowe substituted gold sovereigns. Waverley House at that time had something of the atmosphere of an Edwardian gentleman's club, with heavy fabrics muffling the drafts and the flames of well-stoked fires reflected in highly-polished mahogany, gleaming decanters and brass fenders. Rowe was fond of listening to the gramophone and particularly enjoyed records in the English music-hall tradition, such as the comic monologues of Stanley Holloway. Although he spent much time in arranging his house and garden to his liking, Rowe was also something of a traveller. He took great pleasure in exploring the ports on the itinerary of the Royal Mail Line ships on the long voyage to England. One of his favourite pastimes in later life was to await the arrival of the mail ship in one of these regular ports of call, such as Lisbon or Las Palmas, and suddenly appear on the quayside to surprise acquaintances from the Falklands travelling on leave. Regardless of any arrangements they might already have made for their few hours ashore, he would sweep them away to where he had a car and driver waiting, announcing that he had organised 'luncheon' at a restaurant he liked and that he would show them the best views first. Such displays of somewhat tyrannical kindness characterised many of his dealings with his fellow human beings. He was prone to sudden acts of generosity, but his irascible nature often left the recipients nervous. Ernesto Rowe's later life in Stanley is described in a wonderful character sketch by John Smith, published in the  <em>Falkland Islands Journal </em>of 1998.</p><p>In addition to his business activities on behalf of Estate Louis Williams, Rowe was also vice-consul for Uruguay, a position he took which he took most seriously, citing 'my official Exequatur signed by his late Majesty King George VI and by the then Foreign Minister the late Rt. Hon. Ernest Bevin, dated 28th August 1950'. Rowe remained active in business until his death in Stanley on 22 December 1975. He was buried in Stanley Cemetery on Christmas Eve. He left the property of Estate Louis Williams to his nephew Charles Rowe of Buenos Aires. However the Globe Store was burnt down in 1982 by Argentine troops and other estate buildings in Stanley were badly damaged in the aftermath of the Conflict. The remaining assets of the company, including Waverley House, were sold to Fortuna Ltd in 1988.</p>",

After working for the History of Parliament project and lecturing in the Welsh College of Advanced Technology he was elected Labour MP for Cardiff North in 1966. He later represented two other constituencies: Merthyr Tydfil 1972-1983 and Merthyr and Rhymney 1983-2001. His first government post was as parliamentary under-secretary at the Welsh Office.</p><p><strong>The FCO and the Falklands </strong></p><p>Rowlands' involvement in Falklands affairs began with his appointment as parliamentary under-secretary of state in 1975 responsible to the foreign and commonwealth secretary, Jim <a href=\"/biographies/callaghan_leonard\">CALLAGHAN</a>. Callaghan told his new minister that he would be responsible for the 'dots' on the map, which had a habit of embarrassing or humiliating governments more than any of the major foreign policy issues. Rowlands became responsible for British relations with Central and South America, which included two dependent territories, the Falkland Islands and Belize, with fraught disputed relations with neighbouring states, Argentina and Guatemala. He remained in the FCO for four and a half years until the defeat of the Labour Government in May 1979.</p><p>Rowlands' 'baptism' in UK/Argentine relations centred upon Argentine reaction to Lord SHACKLETON's mission to the Islands. The FCO had not anticipated such a reaction. The successful arrival of the Shackleton team on the Islands in January 1976 precipitated the crisis, leading the Argentines to withdraw their Ambassador and to suggest that the British Ambassador be also withdrawn. This was quickly followed by an even more serious incident when, in February, an Argentine destroyer <em>Admiral Storni </em>accosted the RRS <em>Shackleton </em>(Captain <a href=\"/biographies/warne_philip\">WARNE)</a>, firing across her bows, though not eventually preventing her reaching Stanley. A hurriedly convened secret meeting between Rowlands and the new Argentine Foreign Secretary, Quijano, in New York temporarily defused the situation allowing the RRS <em>Shackleton </em>to leave Stanley.</p><p>The coup in Argentina, March 1976, presented a further challenge in UK/Argentine/Falklands relations, while, at home, the surprise resignation of Prime Minister Harold Wilson, to be succeeded by Jim Callaghan, brought a new foreign secretary, Anthony Crosland. Rowlands was promoted to minister of state assuming new departmental responsibilities for Africa, including Rhodesia {Zimbabwe}, while maintaining responsibility for the Falkland Islands. The Argentine Junta appointed, as deputy foreign minister, a naval captain Allara who remained Rowlands' opposite number for the next three years. These changes prompted a major review within the FCO and Whitehall, from which emerged proposals to negotiate with the Argentines on economic sovereignty over the area's resources and on the dependencies, possibly linked to a long term leaseback arrangement covering the Islands.</p><p>In early February 1977 Foreign Secretary Crosland announced in a parliamentary statement the acceptance of some of Shackleton's recommendations for development within the Islands but asserted little could be done to exploit the area's resources except in collaboration with Argentina. It was, therefore, necessary to talk about the future with both the Islands and the Argentine authorities: to that end Rowlands would set off and hold discussions with both. His proposed visit was, however, preceded by mounting concern based upon intelligence, over a much more aggressive stance taken by elements within the Junta associated with Admiral Massera. Evidence of an Argentine encampment on the uninhabited island of Southern Thule, one of the South Sandwich Islands, led to a formal protest in January 1977.</p><p><strong>Visits to the Islands and Argentina</strong></p><p>Concern over Argentine intentions also prompted ministers and officials to review security arrangements. As it happened a Royal Naval task force including a submarine would be in the Atlantic. Rowlands sought permission from his ministerial colleague at the Ministry of Defence, John Gilbert, for the force to be diverted if necessary and agreement that it might be useful to let the Argentines know that a British task force including a nuclear submarine was in Atlantic waters.</p><p>Rowlands' five-day visit to the Islands was also heavily overshadowed by the knowledge that Foreign Secretary Crosland had suffered an extremely serious stroke. Rowlands was informed of the Foreign Secretary's condition on the morning of his departure and was deeply reluctant to embark on such a complex and potentially fraught mission in such a situation. It was eventually agreed that he could, if he wished, report directly to Prime Minister Callaghan. Rowlands was to receive confirmation of Anthony Crosland's death and the appointment of his successor, David <a href=\"/biographies/owen_david\">OWEN</a>, while staying at the home of one of the Islands senior councillors, Adrian MONK.</p><p>The visit to the Islands went off rather better than possibly could have been expected. Ted Rowlands established a rapport not only with the councillors in Stanley but directly with the Islanders, touring the woolsheds and the Camp. His message and plea to the Islanders echoed Crosland's statement to the Commons, that it was necessary to talk to the Argentines if further developments were to take place. Sovereignty issues would be included but covered by the 'sovereignty umbrella'* which would protect both sides' claims. Islanders, Rowlands maintained, would have nothing to lose by his exploring a way forward with the Argentines. He accepted that the Islanders would not wish to be present directly at the talks but assured councillors that they would be fully informed both personally and officially of any progress or outcomes. LegCo endorsed the minister's intention to try to establish a basis for negotiations with the government of Argentina.</p><p>At the end of the visit the ministerial team assisted in a mercy flight for a pregnant Islander, Valerie Clarke, to the mainland. Her daughter Rachel (now Rachel Bernstein) was delivered successfully and generously the family invited minister Rowlands to be godfather.</p><p>Discussions between Rowlands and Captain Allara in Buenos Aires proved difficult. The Argentines were suspicious of the new concept of treating the sovereignty over resources and the uninhabited islands differently from sovereignty over the inhabited islands. The two sides were not able to agree at the meetings a final set of terms of reference, and Rowlands challenged the Argentines over their actions on Southern Thule. Assurances were given that the Argentine scientific team would be leaving the Islands, and following further diplomatic exchanges the terms of reference for future talks were agreed.</p><p>Rowlands' visit to the Islands and his first meaningful encounter with his Argentine interlocutors influenced his own thinking. His personal contact with Islanders prompted him to believe that Whitehall and the FCO did not fully understand their character and nature. He had been surprised if not shocked by the internal isolation, for many in the Camp had never been to Stanley. Communication within the Islands was poor. He became a champion of a road building programme and the improvement of the airfield. However, he also became sceptical of some of Shackleton's more grandiose recommendations, which he felt would require an influx of people and the possible disruption of traditional communities. In many cases Islanders just wanted to be left alone, to maintain their traditional lifestyles.</p><p>His encounter with the Argentine negotiators unnerved him. Challenged on their occupation of Southern Thule his opposite number had at first denied it. Rowlands, nevertheless, felt that the UK government could not afford to press the issue further without destroying the nascent negotiating process and increasing the likelihood of an Argentine military intervention. These early exchanges coloured and shaped Rowlands' approach to any future talks. There was something of a Jekyll and Hyde character to the Junta, which had to be taken into account in any understandings or agreements reached. Mounting evidence of major human rights abuses by the regime against their own people offered little encouragement to allow the Argentine authorities control over Islanders' lives. While the Labour Party had been transfixed by human rights abuse in Pinochet's neighbouring Chile, Rowlands considered the Argentine situation to be as every bit as bad.</p><p><strong>Talks at New York and the Working Groups</strong></p><p>The run up to the first round of talks with the Argentines, fixed for December 1977 proved as fraught and intense as the earlier contacts. Intelligence emphasized the mercurial role played by Admiral Massera, impatient with the lack of progress in the negotiations and, seemingly, with his fellow Junta members. The incident involving the <em>Admiral Storni </em>in 1976 and the occupation of Southern Thule were attributed to him and the naval 'hawks'.</p><p>Following detailed discussions within the department and with the Ministry of Defence, Prime Minister Callaghan and Foreign Secretary Owen, all concerned agreed that a taskforce including a nuclear submarine should support the talks; if they went badly the Argentines would be told of the Force's presence. At the New York talks in December Rowlands tabled a paper expressing HMG's willingness to discuss fresh sovereignty arrangements in favour of Argentina in relation to the dependencies, and to explore cooperation to develop the continental shelf resources. However, the paper asserted that it was essential that sovereign rights in respect of the Falkland Islands should continue to rest with Britain, and that the present system of administration and government of the Islands should be maintained. Rowlands did not include in the discussions the other possible arrangement - leaseback - having been convinced that such a proposal would have been totally unacceptable to the Islanders. Fortunately, there was sufficient interest within the Argentine delegation in the novel proposals on sovereignty to agree a communiqué setting up two working parties - economic cooperation and political development. Rowlands remained in New York anxiously awaiting news of the Junta's reaction to this communiqué and only when it was favourable did he leave to brief the Islanders' deputation in Río. They accepted his exploring these proposals further.</p><p>1978 saw the first meetings of the working groups agreed between Allara and Rowlands, and, in December 1978, the last between the two ministers. Rowlands felt under less pressure from the Argentines, which, in retrospect, he partly attributed to the Argentines hosting the World Cup and partly to Argentine preoccupation with their other territorial dispute, the Beagle Channel dispute with Chile. This dispute, in fact, impacted upon the Anglo-Argentine exchanges in Lima when, surprisingly, the Argentines insisted that the Islands did not generate a continental shelf, a factor in the Beagle Channel issue. However, the much more vexed question of the Argentine scientific occupation of Southern Thule dominated British ministerial discussions in 1978 when it became clear that the initial Argentine withdrawal had been only temporary, caused by severe weather. The search for a diplomatic solution preoccupied Rowlands for most of the year. As he sought to explain to the Island Councillors in a letter in May the problem lay not with the nature of Argentine scientific activity but with their failure to consult and seek agreement rather than infringing British sovereign rights. He sought a new agreement under which UK/Argentine scientific cooperation would take place on a similar basis to that conducted under the Antarctic Treaty, avoiding sovereignty issues. At the meeting with Allara at Geneva in December 1978 an agreement was reached, though the Argentines refused a clause which would have prevented them from setting up another station,</p><p>Again, following the talks, Rowlands met the Island councillors in Río in early January 1979 to report the outcome. However, at a subsequent joint meeting of ExCo and LegCo councillors objected to the proposed terms and, particularly, feared that the Argentines would extend their activities to other parts of the dependencies. The UK government subsequently agreed not to sign the agreement but to pursue further exploratory talks.</p><p><strong>Opposition and the 1982 Invasion </strong></p><p>The fall of the Labour government on 3 May 1979 brought to an end Rowlands' detailed involvement in UK/Falklands relations. He remained only briefly as a shadow front bench spokesman for foreign and commonwealth affairs before transferring to shadow energy issues under the leadership of John Smith, the next leader of the Labour party.</p><p>Rowlands did, however, return to the fray after the traumatic Argentine invasion of the Islands in April 1982. During the emergency Saturday debate he intervened twice - first to challenge the Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher's attempt to compare the occupation of Southern Thule to the Argentine invasion of the Falklands. There was, he claimed, 'a vast difference - a world of difference between the 1800 people now imprisoned by the Argentines and Southern Thule'. Later, in his own speech to the House, Rowlands spoke emotionally of his ties of friendship and acquaintanceship and of the Islanders' passionate belief in parliamentary democracy. 'They look to and watch everything we say and do in the House. It is one of their most remarkable characteristics...' Rowlands challenged the view that the Government could not have foreseen what was happening. 'Anyone who has dealt with these issues over the years will know that there are a number of tell tale signs'. He instanced the fact that the Argentine military authorities had repudiated the communiqué agreed with the Argentine deputy foreign minister after the February ministerial talks. 'Surely that was one of the most tell tale signs. That was the time to wake up and worry....'</p><p>Rowlands concluded by posing the question -</p><blockquote><blockquote>What should the House say to the Government?'</blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>First it should remind the Government that successive Governments and successive Parliaments have upheld the principle that the wishes, interests, rights, security and safety of the Falkland Islanders are paramount.</blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>Secondly we should charge both the Secretary of State for Defence and the Foreign Secretary to proceed as speedily as possible to restore to the Falkland Islanders their rights, safety and security..... However, if they could not - 'they should go....'</blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>The Islanders have already paid a high price for the initial set of blunders. They have lost their freedom for the first time for 150 years. The guilty men should not go scot-free if we do not retrieve the Islands as quickly as possible....</blockquote></blockquote><p>Rowlands was later invited to give evidence to the Franks Committee, established to enquire into the events leading up to the Argentine invasion. Following the publication of the Committee's report in January 1983, he spoke in the subsequent parliamentary debate on 25th January 1983. He recalled that in the April debate he had called for action to free the Islanders, and was deeply glad and relieved that the action resulted in their freedom. More than two dozen of his constituents had gone to fight. He acknowledged the government's efforts to avoid war, but once these efforts had failed, given the principle and the issues it was right to fight. Rowlands emphasized that successive governments had endeavoured honourably 'to bridge the almost irreconcilable gap' between the UK and Argentine position and to avoid a 'Fortress Falklands' policy which would have led to immeasurable and unpredictable financial and military consequences. He referred to his own experience of four years on the treadmill of British/Argentine negotiations: 'It meant biting one's tongue, pulling one's punches and compromising one's instincts at times. One was negotiating with a pretty nasty bunch of people....'</p><p>However, Rowlands stuck to his claim that ministers had 'mismanaged the peace' in the weeks and months preceding the invasion. He disagreed with the Franks' conclusion that the circumstances leading up to the February 1982 talks were different from December 1977. The 'nightmare' he had feared in 1977 happened on 1 March 1982: 'It happened as vividly as anyone could imagine'. The Junta had disowned the talks and the agreed communiqué.</p><p>Rowlands took no further substantial part in the postwar Falklands debates, concentrating on his new role as shadow energy spokesman until 1987 when he left the front bench. He maintained personal contact, initially through his friendship with Councillor Adrian Monk and since through his goddaughter, Rachel Clarke (now Bernstein).</p><p>After thirty-four years in the Commons, Ted Rowlands decided to stand down at the 2001 elections, left Merthyr Tydfil to retire to his wife's home town, Kidwelly, Carmarthenshire; tragically a retirement totally overshadowed by his wife Janice's sudden death in May 2004. In July 2004 he was recalled to Westminster as a working peer in the House of Lords, thus continuing a parliamentary career, which to date spans forty years and thirteen consecutive parliaments.</p>",

He lived throughout his life in a house on Stanley waterfront built for his grandfather, Captain Frank Rowlands, who was shipwrecked as a Swedish seaman, aged only 16 years, in 1860. Educated at Stanley school, Harold Rowlands began work selling flour in Stanley's West Store. He entered government service in 1948 at the Treasury and Savings Bank where hard work and an aptitude for accountancy took him to the top of his profession in 1972, as financial secretary and commissioner for taxation. From 1974 all Falklands banknotes carried his signature and a Stanley story relates that once, during a round-up in Buenos Aires, he autographed a fiver to establish his identity with the Argentine police.</p><p>During the 1982 Argentine invasion and military occupation, Rowlands as financial secretary, was the most senior administrator after all British expatriate officials had been deported. He won wide respect for his courage, fortitude and resilience as he guided the population through the dangers of occupation, fierce fighting, and Argentine intimidation. He kept the Islands' savings bank operating; refused to levy taxes; blocked Argentine access to the vaults; and obstructed conversion to the inflated Peso currency, informing the Argentines he was 'too old to start thinking about so many noughts!'</p><p>His fellow Islanders chose him to bestow the Freedom of the Falklands upon the Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, who visited in 1983. His prudent stewardship saw the Falklands budget rise from just over half a million pounds in 1973-4, to more than £30 millions by 1988, boosted by income from the fishing industry. After 40 years he retired in 1989. He was elected to LegCo with an overwhelming majority but served only one four-year term. He delighted in the newfound stability and prosperity, but the strain and overwork of the Argentine invasion and its aftermath affected him for the rest of his life.</p><p>He forged an enduring rapport with the Port Squadron of the British Forces, which worked on the waterfront, welcoming them into his home. Rowlands was an excellent storyteller with a vast knowledge of Falklands history. He travelled extensively, loved jazz and musical theatre and enjoyed singing the lyrics of <em>Hello Dolly </em>at parties. He was widely respected as a hard-working, humorous, kind-hearted man of complete integrity. He was awarded an OBE in 1978 and a CBE in 1988. He was unmarried and died in Stanley on 17 April 2004.</p>",

His ancestors were Swedish and Norwegian, Scots and English. He attended school in Stanley and in 1942 started a varied career at local entrepreneur Les HARDY's mineral water factory. His next employment was with the PWD as a truck driver. During this time he was sent to Government House to act as relief chauffeur; but one too many shopping trips for refreshments at the request of the governor's wife ensured he did not continue in this occupation. In 1948 he joined the CDC South Atlantic Sealing Company working at Albemarle station and on company vessels. On the closure of the sealing venture, he joined RMS  <em>Fitzroy </em>as fireman.</p><p>John Rowlands married Daisy Bowles in Christ Church Cathedral on 11 June 1951. They had three children: Robert (b1953), Brian (b1955) and Jennifer (b1961).</p><p>Another CDC development project was underway and Rowlands joined the ill-fated Ajax Bay Freezer Company, where he worked as power station engineer until its closure in 1955. He was then invited to join the FIC to assist in running the works stores department and then as a self-employed contractor he worked at various building and maintenance contracts. In 1960, with the late RW Ross he hired the government Albion Cuthbertson swamp tractor and drained areas of land in the north of East Falkland. He then continued contracting and began importing and selling petrol for the increasing number of ex-military vehicles being imported.</p><p>Along with Jim Shirtcliffe, Rowlands started house building on new sites in West Stanley, building the first Dorran precast concrete panel houses and this continued until completion when he joined Rock &amp; Alluvium Engineers, a south London Company with a defence contract as site agent on several local jobs. Another unusual task he took on at this time was to use the swamp tractor to de-bog the DC4 airliner hijacked to Stanley by the <a href=\"/biographies/condor_group\">CONDOR</a> Group in September 1966.</p><p>He bought the Rock &amp; Alluvium assets and began to undertake larger contracts on his own behalf, working for the British Antarctic Survey, the European Space Research Organization, the Ministry of Defence and Falkland Islands Government, including the power station extension and paving many of the Stanley roads. The quality of the road building works especially was a source of great pride to him in later years in comparison with some of the more recent efforts in that field.</p><p>Rowlands was a long-standing member of the Labour Federation (later the General Employees Union), of the Working Men's Social Club and the Falkland Islands Defence Force. He was elected to Legislative Council from 1962-65, but he became disillusioned with the failure to make any progress on a broader front other than issues to benefit farmers. He did not seek re-election. He was one of the founding members of the National Progressive Party which was a political party formed during the mid 1960s and which started campaigning to defend Falklands sovereignty when it appeared to be in danger from 1964 onwards. He was treasurer and vice-chairman of the Falkland Club and an enthusiastic member of the planning and building committee from its inception until his resignation through ill health in 1998.</p><p>He was local subcontractor to Johnston Construction Ltd on the building of Stanley Airport from 1974-78 and employed many of his fellow citizens, enabling them to learn new skills and improve their earnings. His equipment was all damaged during the 1982 conflict and for health reasons he was unable to continue contracting work and he returned to PWD as plant storeman until his retirement in 1993.</p><p>Rowlands was a keen observer of the progress in Islands life since 1982 and was often concerned about the poor quality of work and wasteful use of much of the development money which had been given to the Islands. He also believed that the newfound fishing wealth was being distributed in too many non-productive schemes often for little or no effort or return. His knowledge and advice was sought by some of the younger generation seeking new opportunities and it gave him great pleasure to see some of his ex-employees such as Paul Bonner and Michael and Neil McKay grow into the Falklands contractors of today.</p><p>Rowlands enjoyed one holiday during his 50 year working career when in 1979 after many years of reading <em>Time  </em>and <em>National Geographic </em>he travelled through Canada and the USA and brought the pages to life. His observations on this journey would have made a very entertaining travel book.</p><p>His knowledge of Falkland history was endless. He had collected many entertaining accounts of Stanley and of some of its most colourful characters and events. Although a shy and private man, on better acquaintance he was well-informed, being an avid reader seeking both enlightenment and humour and a great conversationalist on many subjects. Every encounter with him was an education.</p><p>He died on 26 February 2000.</p>",

She is mentioned in <a href=\"/biographies/helsby_thomas\">HELSBY</a>'s account of the murder of <a href=\"/biographies/brisbane_matthew\">BRISBANE</a> as taking refuge with the other survivors on Hog Island. When Lt <a href=\"/biographies/smith_henry\">SMITH</a> took charge in 1834 he agreed with her that if she could make milch cows of the wild cattle caught by the gauchos, she might keep every second calf. Her ownership of these cows worried later naval commanders, as Antonina Roxa had accumulated a considerable quantity. A naval captain referred the question of ownership to the Admiral at Río, who in turn passed it to the Admiralty, whence it was referred back to the newly appointed Lieutenant Governor <a href=\"/biographies/moody_richard\">MOODY</a> - who finally agreed that she might keep the cattle. He told London: 'I have considered it advisable to employ her as a gaucho in the field, being an active person riding as a man (astride, not side-saddle) and tolerably skilful in the use of the lasso'. Lt <a href=\"/biographies/lowcay_robert\">LOWCAY</a>, in charge in 1839 noted: 'she was a very humane and good character, and particularly useful in the Colony as a doctrix and midwife'.</p><p>She became the first person in the Islands to swear an oath of loyalty to the Crown in 1841, and was mentioned by Governor <a href=\"/biographies/rennie_george\">RENNIE</a> in LegCo in 1850 as a foreigner who wished to be naturalised. In the 1843 census she owned one sixth of an acre and several houses, plus ten cattle and forty sheep. She moved to Stanley when the seat of government shifted and in 1847 owned a plot and property worth £30. During the late 1840s she was employed by Commander <a href=\"/biographies/sulivan_sir\">SULIVAN</a> as a children's nurse, but her weakness for drink undid her. In the 1830s she had been married to an American sailor named Kenney (or Kinney), but they were divorced by Lt Smith in May 1838. Around 1851 she married Pedro Varela, a gaucho from Montevideo about ten years her junior and found employment in the FIC farm at Hope Place. In 1866 she leased (in her own name) a station of 6000 acres for £5 at Middle Point north of Port San Carlos. She died of cancer on 14 February 1869 and is buried in Stanley cemetery.

He came from farming stock and may have arrived in the Falklands in 1847 as a shepherd at Fitzroy for Captain <a href=\"/biographies/packe_robert1\">PACKE</a>. He married Mary Ellen Roach in 1852, daughter of Edward Roach, one of the thirty Military <a href=\"/biographies/pensioners_the\">PENSIONERS</a>. Edward Roach had served in the British Army in Madras, where his two daughters were born. Rudd appears to have moved from the Packe farm at Fitzroy to work for the Falkland Islands Company soon after it received its Royal Charter in 1852.</p><p>The Rudds had eight children: Anna Maria (b1853), Helen (or Ellen) Elizabeth (b1855), John Edward (b1857), Mary Jane (b1858), Louisa (b1860, but died young), Eliza (b1861), Louisa (b1863, and named after her baby sister) and William Thomas Darwin (born 1865, after his father's murder). There are some descendants of the family still in the Islands.</p><p>The family lived at Darwin, where Rudd was promoted to manager for the Company in 1861, overseeing many hundreds of acres of land where wild and tame cattle herds grazed. Among the farm workers at this time were small numbers of South American gauchos, whose expertise in herding and taming the wild cattle was necessary to the Company's beef and hide business. The gauchos did, however, have a bad reputation for playing and living hard and were rather volatile when they had drink taken.</p><p>On 15 October 1864, whilst on horseback in the mountains near Darwin, John Rogers Rudd was attacked and knifed by one of his gauchos, Manuel Gill. The murder is described in detail by the company manager James <a href=\"/biographies/lane_james\">LANE</a> (based in Stanley some sixty miles away from Darwin) in the Falkland Island Company's despatch book of 1864:</p><blockquote><blockquote>10th November 1864</blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>Sir,</blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>I regret to have to report a most deplorable event, the assassination of the Camp Manager, John Rudd, by a half-bred Indian [a name commonly applied to gauchos in the Islands] named Gill, on the 15th October. I little thought, when writing to you only 2 days before, that there was \"no one capable of taking his place\", of having to communicate the painful intelligence of his life being thus terminated. He was a most worthy fellow, and the Company have lost a zealous and valuable servant - he leaves a wife and six young children and expecting shortly a seventh.</blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>At about 5'oclock on Sunday afternoon the 16th October, when at the Dairy, I met men coming into Stanley, who informed me of the circumstances, which were these:</blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>Rudd started off on the Saturday morning with a lad (Doolan) for the 2nd Corral, and at the Cerritos House (under Mount Usborne) was joined by Gill, who was going to the 2nd Corral to kill Government cattle; poor Rudd going himself to see the other men there and make necessary arrangements.</blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>They had travelled [on horseback] as far as one of the streams feeding the San Carlos River, and had crossed it when Gill came behind Rudd and gave him two stabs with his knife. The man chose the edge of a morass - he had a horse which was almost singular in passing over such ground, and Rudd's horse, as is generally the case, would not move without difficulty when on its brink - he had nothing in his hand and tried to get away, but could not; the wretch then drove his horse against Rudd's, gave another stab and Rudd threw himself into the stream. The man then went to the boy [Doolan], and said he was going to kill him - he desisted however, and seeing Rudd had crawled to the bank, he stabbed him again just below the heart and then went away, - shortly returned and placing his coat over his poor victim, who told him that he forgave him.</blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>Rudd could not move - the lad could do little, and after a short time he was sent by Rudd for assistance - this was about four o' clock in the afternoon. The boy reached Darwin Harbour at about 9, when men went off, but could not reach the poor sufferer until 4 the next morning; he had remained exposed and alone, all night in dreadful suffering with snow and rain (November being the Spring season in the southern hemisphere) with 5 wounds and his clothing perforated in 9 places.</blockquote></blockquote><p>Lane tells of his haste to find the doctor and prepare him for the long ride to Rudd. Lane also arranged with the magistrate to send a constable and party to Second Corral (across the mountains) to find the murderer. The doctor was exhausted when he arrived with the party at the small hut at Cerritos, and could only issue directions for medicines and treatment for Rudd, some five hours ride away. 'Unhappily, men arrived at Cerritos in the middle of the night with the news that Rudd had died'. Lane went in search of Gill, with four of his men. He instigated a reward for Gill's capture, to which the government, the Company and the Benefit Club contributed £65. He reported:</p><blockquote><blockquote>I proceeded on Tuesday with the Doctor to Darwin Harbour but must pass over the sad trying scene there with the poor widow and children and the arrival of the body in the evening, and its examination - nothing could be more distressing ...</blockquote></blockquote><p>The following morning (Wednesday) the Doctor returned to Stanley. On Thursday morning the <em>Perseverance </em>arrived at 7 am and at 8 was under weigh with her sad freight, Mrs Rudd and all her children and the corpse. An inquest was held on Friday and a verdict of willful murder returned. And the funeral (in Stanley cemetery) took place the next day.</p><p>After a great deal of activity searching the mountains and valleys of Cerritos, Gill was eventually found, after he had headed south, near to Darwin (tc his paddock is known today as Gill's or Kiel's Park). Gill was escorted to Stanley:</p><blockquote><blockquote>On the following Thursday the 1st of November, he was tried and found guilty of wilful murder and will, I believe, be hanged on Monday next, the 14th November.</blockquote></blockquote><p>Lane goes on to say:</p><blockquote><blockquote>Gill had been some ten years in the Company's service and was always considered a quiet and inoffensive man and preferred by Rudd, when going on journeys, to others - he was with him all the time occupied counting cattle in Lafonia - there were no angry words between them on the day of the murder, but it would appear now that the man had wanted to go inside [Lafonia] to kill cattle and not to 2nd Corral.</blockquote></blockquote><p>There apparently arose some resentment and 'the Devil got possession of him'. Indeed Manuel Gill's motives were never clear and he appears to have been deranged.</p><blockquote><blockquote>I have done all I could for Mrs Rudd, giving her half the house occupied by her brother-in-law Robson and promising her £4 a month for 12 months...........The eldest girl is about 15 and will be taken by Mrs Pyne - the only boy is about 9 only and I will see to his education.</blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>November 15th. The murderer was hanged this morning.</blockquote></blockquote><p>The Company also appears to have commissioned John Rudd's tombstone, on which he is described as 'Much respected'. The river crossing where Gill murdered Rudd became known as Rudd's Pass.</p><p>Mary Ellen Rudd remarried to William Roberts in 1867 and they had seven children: she died in Stanley on 6 June 1902, aged 67.</p>",

On 17 October 1766 Ruiz Puente sailed from Ferrol with the frigates  <em>Liebre </em>and  <em>Esmeralda  </em>commissioned to receive the Falkland Islands from <a href=\"/biographies/bougainville_louis\">BOUGAINVILLE</a> in the name of His Catholic Majesty the King of Spain. After meeting Bougainville in the River Plate, Ruiz Puente sailed for the Falklands, entering Berkeley Sound on 24 March 1767, where Bougainville was waiting for him in the  <em>La Boudeuse </em>. Bougainville relinquished command on 1 April and Ruiz Puente took possession and hoisted the Spanish colours on 2 April, when a 21 gun salute was fired at sunrise and sunset from both the ships and the shore. The Spanish officers viewed Port Louis settlement (which they renamed Puerto de la Soledad) with considerable dismay noting that the thirty-six 'buildings left behind by the French are not fit to be called houses, they are barracks;' only the house left by the French commander was built of stone and thatched with straw. It is not known what steps Ruiz Puente took to rectify this situation or to strengthen Spanish sovereignty.</p><p>However, in November 1769 he sent the schooner  <em>San Felipe </em>, commanded by Don Angel Santes <em>,  </em>on a <em> </em>surveying cruise to the north of the Islands where he encountered the  <em>Tamar </em>, commanded by Anthony <a href=\"/biographies/hunt_anthony\">HUNT</a>, two miles north of Cape Tamar. Hunt informed Santes that the Falklands belonged to the British and that he should leave the Islands. On his return to Puerto de la Soledad, Ruiz Puente sent Santes back, this time with Mario Plata, an infantry lieutenant on board, with a formal but courteous protest which was delivered to Hunt in San Carlos Water. Santes then returned to Puerto de la Soledad with a further protest from Hunt. It then seems that Ruiz Puente sent Santes and Plata to Buenos Aires to report to Governor Francisco Bucareli, but with orders to enter Port Egmont first so that he could give Bucareli up to date information about the British settlement there. The  <em>San Felipe </em>entered Port Egmont on 18 December, but Santes and Plata were not allowed to land and after being supplied with water and some pitch departed the following day. Ruiz Puente remained in Puerto de la Soledad until 27 January 1773 when he retired, being relieved as temporary governor by  <em>Capitán de Infanteria </em>Domingo <a href=\"/biographies/chauri_domingo\">CHAURI</a>, who was stationed at Puerto de la Soledad at the time.</p>",

        "body": "<p>Argentine entrepreneur, was born in Gibraltar on 26 August 1902, the son of an Irishman Ernest A Ryan and his wife Magdalena Navas. Ryan's grandfather, who hailed from Cork, had supposedly set foot on Gibraltar on his return from the Crimean War and settled there. Ryan served his apprenticeship as a naval engineer in the Admiralty Dockyard in Gibraltar from 1917 to 1922 qualifying at Christian Brothers College. He then served as a marine engineer at sea and made sea trips with his father, who was likewise a naval engineer and an expert in the salvaging and repairing of ships.</p><p>Ryan arrived in Argentina in 1924 with his parents and his three brothers, Julio, Pedro and Enrique. After a period in the drawing office of the Central Argentine Railways, then British owned, he became a contractor's representative with a marine engineering company at the Boca, Buenos Aires. In 1931 Ryan and his father purchased the Farina marine workshop and expanded the business by buying additional warehouses and workshops, reportedly financed from the winnings of a lottery in Spain. After the death of his father, Ryan brought his three brothers into the business, renamed Ryan Hermanos.</p><p>The company thrived, buying up other businesses in the Buenos Aires district, acting as contractors to the British owned railways in Argentina and Uruguay and providing a comprehensive repair facility for shipping at Buenos Aires and Rosario. Among his clients was Aristotle Onassis, who provided Ryan with a flow of work on Greek ships. During World War II, Ryan's shipyards effected repair work on more than two hundred allied ships, fitting many of them with gun mountings and degaussing equipment. It was during this period that Ryan diversified his interests, becoming a major shareholder in many companies including the Compañia Argentina de Pesca (Pesca), which owned the pioneer Antarctic whaling station at Grytviken, South Georgia.</p><p>When Ryan took overall control of Pesca from the Tornquist group in 1944, he formed a close relation with the Argentine dictator Juan <a href=\"/biographies/peron_juan\">PERÓN</a>. Perón had a vision to make Argentina a powerful and dynamic state and he saw Ryan, with his interests in South Georgia, as an ally in his declared objective of furthering Argentina's political aspirations in the Antarctic. Perón and Ryan hatched a grandiose project where Ryan would build the world's largest whale factory ship, <em>Juan Perón, </em>and send it with a fleet of catchers to the Antarctic to hunt whales, the oil of which was badly needed by a 'starving' Europe. The whole project became a fiasco. The company was accused of attempting to employ Nazis, who had worked on pre-war German whaling expeditions and found refuge in Argentina, but the main reason was a Norwegian law which banned their nationals, who had the whaling expertise, working on foreign factory ships. Ryan also fell foul of local currency regulations. The ship, built in the Belfast yard of Harland and Wolff, remained the largest whale factory ship in the world, but one which never handled a whale. She was taken over by the Argentine government and deployed as a tanker and on the fall of Perón in 1955 renamed <em>Cruz del Sur </em>. Eventually she suffered an ignominious end, being auctioned off by the state and cut in two for oil drilling platforms.</p><p>Ryan continued to work the Grytviken whaling station and much investment was poured into Pesca to improve both its fleet of whale catchers and the fabric of the station which in 1957 was considered the most modern in the world. But whale catches, and the prices received for whale products were falling, and in 1965, after a period when the station was leased to the Japanese, it was closed. By this time Ryan, tired of working the station with Argentine flagged transports had transferred Pesca to a raft of wholly owned companies under British, Gibraltar and Norwegian flags. He eventually sold the redundant station to Christian Salvesen &amp; Co. after the British government refused to sanction a deal with the Soviets.</p><p>Ryan claimed to be very pro-British. He bought much of his materials for his South Georgia whaling station in Britain, used a long established firm of merchant bankers in the City of London to manage his business in Europe and was a regular visitor with his Yugoslav born wife Antonia Dorich and his two daughters Martha Betty (b1930) and Mabel Antonia (b1935) to Ascot and Epsom racecourses. He doubtless had good relations with many British politicians and administrators but there is no record of Ryan ever having visited South Georgia or the Falkland Islands. In Argentina and Uruguay he continued to hold a wide portfolio of interests from shipping, engineering, insurance, agriculture and a vineyard on the slopes of the Andes near Mendoza.</p><p>Ryan died in Buenos Aires on 18 June 1990 aged 87 years.</p>",

        "body": " <p>colonial secretary, was born in Edgbaston, Warwickshire on 8 June 1881, the son of Edward Cocks Johnston, surgeon. (The addition of 'St.' was a later affectation.) He was educated at Queen Elizabeth College, Guernsey and Cheltenham College, going on to Birmingham University, to study law at the Middle Temple and medicine at Westmister Hospital. He became a Member of the Royal College of Surgeons and a Licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians. He worked briefly for the Local Government Board in 1906 before joining the Colonial Service the following year. From 1907 to 1917 he served in various judicial, medical and administrative appointments in Fiji, until he was seconded for war service in France. He was then attached to the War Office for special duty (for which he received the thanks of the Army Council) and was promoted brevet lieutenant-colonel.</p><p>In 1919 he was posted to the Falkland Islands as colonial secretary, and in effect acting governor as Sir Douglas <a href=\"/biographies/young_sir\">YOUNG</a> was about to depart on retirement leave. St Johnston's health was poor - the Spanish influenza 'had played so much mischief with me in France'. He saw himself as an up-country administrator and observed that he had 'not the remotest idea about the many little observances that appertain to a Governor's life ... I should particularly have to take on two new spheres of work, those of Governor and Colonial Secretary simultaneously'. He believed he was the first doctor on record to be made colonial secretary or acting governor. St Johnston arrived on the SS <em>Kenuta </em>on 19 September. He enjoyed his relatively brief spell on the Islands: he conducted a census of trees in Stanley (there were 54) and had the track to the Naval Wireless Station at Moody Brook made into a driving road. He claims to have worked out a scheme for a metalled road system across Camp, to be marked by permanent posts. He presented a baked clay Babylonian inscribed brick to the new Museum in the Town Hall, but alas it was placed under a skylight and dissolved when snow leaked through. Leaving the Islands in April 1920 on the <em>Orcoma </em>, he was presented with an address. He was in good spirits:</p><blockquote><blockquote>By this time my health had very much improved, I had put on weight and lost the blueness of my lips which had previously so much worried my doctors; so that in a way the Falklands became for me a health resort, rather than the reverse.</blockquote></blockquote><p>He had a distinguished career in the West Indies thereafter: as colonial secretary in the Leeward Islands (1920-25), administering Dominica, Antigua and St Kitts/Nevis on various occasions between 1925 and 1929. He was governor of the Leeward Islands from 1929 until his retirement in 1936 and was awarded the KCMG in 1931. During World War II he returned to military duties and joined the Ministry of Supply in 1942.</p><p>In 1906 he married Alice Lethbridge. St Johnston was a prolific writer: he lists sixteen books in his entry in <em>Who's Who </em>. One of them published in 1919 was <em>The Falkland Islands </em>whose author was simply given as St J. Most of his writing is on colonial themes and <em>From a Colonial Governor's Note-Book </em>has a chapter on the Falklands, from which the quotations above are taken. He died in Eastbourne on 29 August 1950 - his wife predeceased him in 1948.</p>",

        "body": " <p>whaling company owner, was born on 30 July 1897 in Edinburgh, second son of Theodore Salvesen and Annie, neé Burnet. His grandfather Christian Salvesen had arrived in Scotland from Norway in 1851 and built up a successful shipping and agency company based in Leith. Christian's son, Theodore, bought and started whaling stations in Iceland, the Faroes and Shetland. In 1908 the company went south to start a whaling station in the Falklands at New Island, followed a year later by one at Leith Harbour, South Georgia. Salvesen also ran a fleet of floating expeditions operating first around the South Shetlands and the Antarctic Peninsula and later in the Antarctic oceans round the globe.</p><p>Salvesen was educated at Edinburgh Academy. He joined the Indian Army in 1916 and retired as captain in 1923. He then graduated at Oxford and stayed on at New College as a lecturer in economics. He joined Christian Salvesen &amp; Co in 1928. Formidably intelligent and strong-minded, he devoted himself to the Salvesen whaling business, and quickly became the leading expert on Antarctic whaling among the British and Norwegian companies who dominated the industry up to World War II. He spent several seasons in the Antarctic in the 1930s both at South Georgia and on the floating factories. He played a prominent part in the negotiations of that time between the whaling companies to restrict catch and preserve stock levels, and successfully defended Salvesen against a Norwegian union claim that all crews should be Norwegian. As a result of this, with the cooperation of the British seafarers' unions, the British share of Salvesen's whaling crews was substantially increased, reaching half after World War II. He was particularly interested in the technical development of whale processing and the elimination of waste with new by-products to supplement the traditional whale oil. The Salvesen floating factories and Leith Harbour stood out in technical efficiency.</p><p>After World War II, in which the Salvesen floating factories were all lost, two new larger floating factories and a new catcher fleet were built, and the Leith Harbour station was extensively modernised. Leith Harbour by this time was less important as a whaling station, but it was also the base for overhauling the catcher fleet of up to 40 ships during the winter. The neighbouring station of Stromness was incorporated and a large new floating dock set up there. Salvesen continued to go south at least once in three seasons, and took with him younger managers for their training. At home he became deeply involved in the International Whaling Commission and the problems of limiting catch to stop depletion of whale stocks when the original British and Norwegian companies had been joined by Dutch, Russian, Japanese and Panamanian operators. These efforts were fruitless and Antarctic whaling effectively ended around 1970. Salvesen's floating factory operations finished in 1963, and Leith Harbour finally stood down in 1965.</p><p>Salvesen was suspicious in his dealings with the Falkland Islands Government. He had inherited from his father Theodore the conviction that officials were not to be trusted, and this was confirmed by misunderstandings on a post World War I scheme, fortunately not carried out, for Salvesen to start a new whaling and sealing station in the Falklands. (New Island had closed in 1916). He also thought that the pomp assumed by some governors on their occasional visits to South Georgia was absurd (as did the whalers). But his relations with the succession of magistrates on the island, who shared many of his enthusiasms, were close and friendly.</p><p>He married Moira, neé Cameron, in 1933 and had two sons (one of whom died young) and four daughters. He died in Edinburgh on 1 February 1970.</p>",

After a succession of appointments he joined the frigate  <em>Santa Teresa </em>, and in 1776, he sailed for the River Plate.

On 16 September 1781 he was promoted to the rank of  <em>teniente de fragata </em>and on 26 September 1783 to  <em>teniente de navío, </em>and a few years later to  <em>capitán de fragata.  </em></p><p>In 1791 Sanguineto <em> </em>was appointed  <em>comandante gobernador  </em>of the Spanish settlement at Puerto de la Soledad (Port Louis) in command of the corvette  <em>Santa Eulalia,  </em>in succession to Juan José de <a href=\"/biographies/elizalde_y\">ELIZALDE</a>, taking over on 1 March 1791.

Sanguineto relieved Aldana for the first time on 15 June 1795, serving once again as  <em>comandante gobernador </em>for his third term until 15 March 1796, when he was relieved once again by Aldana.

On each occasion he was governor Sanguineto reported on the current state of the batteries and on the work and repairs carried out on the buildings, noting that the hospital was always in a good state of repair. Government House, which was built of stone, was however in need of repair and all its windows needed replacing; the storehouse was infested with rats. On 26 July 1793 Sanguineto convened a council of officers to consider how to deal with repeated large scale sealing activities at various places in West Falkland by an American sloop and a number of smaller vessels and it was resolved to send the brig  <em>San Julián </em>there to investigate, but the outcome of this visit is not known.</p><p>On 22 June 1793 the brig  <em>Belén </em>brought news that Spain had declared war on France and that communication with that country was now prohibited.

His mother Eliza was the daughter of Samuel and Grace Shedden who lived in a modest house in Cheltenham. Frederick had an elder brother Edmund and in due course followed him to Cheltenham to live with his grandparents and attend Cheltenham Grammar School.</p><p>He entered the civil service of Jamaica in 1863. In 1883 and 1884 he was acting commissioner of the Turks and Caicos Islands, a Jamaican dependency.</p><p>He arrived in the Falkland Islands on 9 June 1890 on the Kosmos steamer  <em>Abydos, </em>and <em> </em>took over the duties of Edward Pakenham <a href=\"/biographies/brooks_edward\">BROOKS</a> who departed in July. On 15 July he was appointed colonial secretary, and acting postmaster on a nine-month contract. He was officially on leave from Jamaica and on half salary. Because of the shortage of staff and the extended leave given to Pakenham Brooks his period of service was extended to seventeen months. On the departure of Governor <a href=\"/biographies/kerr_thomas\">KERR</a> on 29 March 1891, Sanguinetti in his position of senior justice on the roll of Justices of the Peace took over the duties as acting governor until the arrival of Sir Roger <a href=\"/biographies/goldsworthy_sir\">GOLDSWORTHY</a> on 13 April 1891. Goldsworthy intervened on his behalf and wrote that 'he had fulfilled his duties here to my entire satisfaction and has at all times willingly accorded me his assistance and advice' and asked that this extension to his service should be treated as special duties to avoid losing valuable pension rights in Jamaica.</p><p>He is best remembered in his role as acting postmaster for the issue of provisional bisected postage stamps in 1891 which excited collectors and stamp dealers around the world. The British Post Office had invited the Falkland Islands Government in July 1890 to reduce postage within the British Empire from 4d per half ounce to 2½d from the beginning of 1891. Sanguinetti calculated that this would lead to a loss of £73 per annum in revenue. Nevertheless the Council met in September and approved the decision. But no action was taken to order 2½d and ½d stamps until December 1890 so that until the arrival of these stamps the 1d stamps in stock were cut in half diagonally for use as ½d stamps. Initially the stamps were overprinted '½d' as well, although this practice was soon largely abandoned. There were delays in the supply of stamps in the new denominations. Firstly those ordered by Governor Kerr and Sanguinetti were of unusual size and colours which the Crown Agents would not accept as they did not conform to those recommended by the Universal Postal Union of which the Falkland Islands had been a member since 1879. Secondly the first supplies of new stamps in the correct colours were lost when the Kosmos steamer ' <em>Neko </em>' was in collision in the English Channel off Ushant, and sank within three minutes. A further printing of the stamps had to be ordered. Meanwhile many orders for the overprinted bisected stamps had come from overseas and these had to be turned down by the postal staff in order to protect the small stock of 1d stamps. Finally the new ½d and 2½d stamps were put on sale on 10 September and the overprinted bisected stamps were declared invalid for postage. It was at this stage that many orders for bisected stamps from dealers and collectors were fulfilled, although these are today classed as 'posthumous souvenirs'.</p><p>Sanguinetti left the colony on 22 December 1891 having made a favourable impression on all those who had had dealings with him. On 22 August 1898 he was appointed by the governor of Jamaica as the first commissioner of the Cayman Islands, another Jamaican dependency. The commissioner combined administration with the post of judge of the Supreme Court, a position he held until he retired through ill health in 1906. He died in London of throat cancer on 26 October 1906.</p>",

        "body": "<p>German astronomer and meteorologist (South Georgia), was born into a family of many respected scientists at Brunswick {Braunschweig} in Germany on 30 January 1852. He studied mathematics and natural sciences in Göttingen , concluding with a PhD thesis in astronomy. He continued his studies in Berlin, until he was employed at the astrophysical observatory in O'Gyalla (Hungary) in 1876. Afterwards he was observer at the Hamburg observatory from 1878-1889.</p><p>During the first International Polar Year (1882-1883), Schrader led the German meteorological and magnetic station on South Georgia. The expedition, comprising ten persons, sailed from Hamburg on 2 June 1882 to Montevideo where they bought livestock and other equipment. They then departed on 23 July aboard the German naval corvette  <em>Moltke </em>and arrived at South Georgia on 12 August, finally landing at Royal Bay on 22 August. They had to clear between one and two metres of snow before they could build a living hut, two magnetic observatories, an astronomical observatory, a revolving dome for the telescope, and a barn. An experimental garden was established later. On 27 August they celebrated the topping-out and on 3 September  <em>Moltke </em>departed. All the scientists were involved in meteorological measurements which began on 13 September and magnetic observations which started two days later. In addition, Schrader was in charge of astronomical investigations and pendulum measurements to determine the coordinates of and the gravity of the earth.</p><p>The expedition members were delighted by the splendour of the landscape with its alpine character and the phenomena of foehn winds. On 29 September they sighted the 'great September comet,' which could be seen until 12 December. Schrader was lucky to observe the planet Venus during its whole transit in front of the sun on 6 December 1882, although a violent westerly gale was shaking the revolving dome. The worst gale occurred on 28 December with winds up to 26·3m/sec.</p><p>Except for chasing eight sheep, which escaped early in January 1883, their stay passed without special incident. On Schrader's birthday the expedition members arranged a firework display and named Cape Schrader at the south eastern entrance of Moltke Harbour in his honour. When the weather was favourable, they made 33 land excursions and 13 trips with their small whaling boat. On 27 and 28 August an unusual feature was observed in the recordings of pressure and in the tide gauge, which later could be related to the eruption of Krakatoa on 27 August 1883.</p><p>Before the naval ship  <em>Marie </em>arrived at Royal Bay on 1 September 1883 to collect the expedition, she called at Port Stanley for three days, where the German Naval Observatory (Deutsche Seewarte) had installed an additional meteorological station of second order led by Captain JHMC <a href=\"/biographies/seemann_jhmc\">SEEMANN</a>, the resident agent of the German Steamship Company Kosmos. On 6 September 1883,  <em>Marie </em>left South Georgia with the expedition, leaving behind all the buildings and observatories. She arrived in Montevideo on 25 September, where Schrader continued his observations to determine the difference in longitude between Montevideo and South Georgia, which was needed to calculate the Island's exact geographical coordinates. Schrader left on 11 October and reached Hamburg on 15 November 1883.</p><p>From 1886 to 1888 he led a scientific expedition of the New Guinea Company to Kaiser-Wilhelms-Land (German New Guinea), where he established a meteorological station in Finsh Harbour. He also collected zoological and ethnographical material, some of which can still be seen in the City Museum of Braunschweig. Finally in 1889 Schrader became Privy Senior Executive Officer (Geheimer Regierungsrat) and Imperial Inspector responsible for the examination of ocean navigators and ocean helmsmen in Berlin. In August 1914 he joined a German solar eclipse expedition to the Crimea which was forced to leave Russia hurriedly on the outbreak of World War I. Schrader died in Berlin on 13 August 1930, shortly after his retirement.</p><p>Schrader was a very conscientious astronomer, who also gained great experience as geophysicist and meteorologist during many expeditions. As station leader he seems to have been very formal and precise. His research and his editorial work for the  <em>Neu-Guinea-Kalender </em>(1889-1918) and the  <em>Nautisches Jahrbuch </em>( <em>Nautical Yearbook </em>) after 1899 proved very valuable. A small glacier flowing to the head of Wilson Harbour on the south coast of South Georgia was charted and named Schrader Glacier during the second German Antarctic Expedition (1911-1912) under the leadership of Wilhelm <a href=\"/biographies/filchner_wilhelm\">FILCHNER</a> (1877-1957). His name was also given to the Schrader Mountains, the Schrader Range and to Mount Schrader (764 m) all on Papua New Guinea.</p>",

        "body": "<p>German traveller and photographer, was born in Gornitz, Prussia {near Poznan in Poland} around 1849. In early 1875 he married an English girl, Sarah Smith, and began to live in Brighton (Sussex) where he ran The Anglo German [photographic] Studio, specialising in portraits and views of notable buildings. Around 1877, he began several long journeys which led him to South Africa, South America including Tierra del Fuego, where he investigated mineral resources, and further on to Patagonia. Then he moved to the Falkland Islands, which were seldom visited at that time. During all his voyages he took wonderful photographs, which he published in several editions in Leipzig (Germany) and in London.</p><p>From his photographic albums we can partly reconstruct his last journey, which took place about 1887. From Hamburg, Schulz boarded a ship from the German Steam Navigation Company Kosmos to travel to the Falkland Islands. In South America they stopped at Buenos Aires, passed the Strait of Magellan with the destination Valparaiso and then back to Stanley. This voyage is documented in an album of 21 photo engravings. Schulz stayed on the Falkland Islands for a year and travelled around with local boats. When he finally came back to Europe he published a general account of his visit of 20 to 22 pages, adding 18 or 20 photographs according to the edition, which showed wild life, a stone run, some buildings, the centre of Stanley and two other settlements, as well as the landscape. In his text he focussed on historical, geographical, climatic, geological, biological, and economical description including external and internal communications and government, with figures for population and trade. Then Schulz gave some information about Port Stanley: besides three schools, two good hotels and various shops, a local rifle club, a social club, a mutual benefit club and a small library provided necessary amusement for the population. He also described walks near Stanley and his visits to Darwin and Goose Green, as well as to Port Louis on Berkeley Sound. Agriculture (tillage) was almost non-existent, in contrast to sheep farming, which was very successful. Altogether the landscape of the Falkland Islands made a wild and inhospitable impression on Schulz. Nevertheless he stayed during 1887, looked around with open eyes and took pictures of the most impressive sites and did some portraits (one of FE <a href=\"/biographies/cobb_frederick\">COBB</a> survives).</p><p>In 1890 Schulz returned for a while to Brighton. The first edition of his  <em>The Falkland Islands </em>was published by Julius Klinkhardt in Leipzig in <em> </em>?1887. <em> </em>Three British editions of  <em>The Falkland Islands </em>were published by G Gross in London in ?1890, ?1893, and ?1894. A shorter popular account was published in the German magazine G <em>lobus </em>in 1891.</p><p>During the early 1890s Schulz prepared a photographic record of perfume factories in America and Europe on behalf of a professor of botany, Friedrich August Flückiger: this was published by Gröber of Leipzig in 1893. His family, but not Schulz himself, feature in the 1891 and 1901 censuses in Brighton. His wife Sarah is shown as head of the family with six children.</p><p><a href=\"/biographies/cobb_frederick\">See Image 92</a></p>",

        "body": "<p>conservationist and artist, was born on 14 September 1909 in London, only child of the explorer Robert Falcon Scott and the sculptress Kathleen Bruce. He never knew his father who died in Antarctica in March 1912 and who wrote in his last letter to his wife: 'make the boy interested in natural history if you can. It is better than games'. A request that was to be amply fulfilled in his son's life. Educated at West Down preparatory school and Oundle, he initially studied natural science at Cambridge but switched to history of art and architecture in his final year. He studied animal painting at the Munich State Academy and in 1933 enrolled at the Royal Academy Schools in London. In yachting, he won an Olympic bronze medal in 1936. In 1940 he joined the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve as a sub-lieutenant, ending the war as a lieutenant-commander, having earned two DSC's and being mentioned three times in despatches. After the war he continued his yachting, skippering <em>Sovereign </em>in the America's Cup in 1964. In addition, he developed an interest in gliding, becoming British champion in 1963.</p><p>But his real passion, in line with his father's wish, was 'natural history'. While at Cambridge he had developed an interest in wildfowling which developed into his lifelong interest in birds, and particularly ducks and geese. In 1948 Scott established the Severn Wildfowl Trust at Slimbridge in Gloucestershire and in the 1950s became a leading figure in the new international movement for environmental conservation. He helped establish the Species Survival Commission (SSC) of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and invented the system of Red Data Books listing endangered species throughout the world. He also founded the World Wildlife Fund, now the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) the world's foremost international conservation organisation, and designed its panda logo. In 1959 he helped establish the Charles Darwin Foundation to conserve the Galapagos Islands.</p><p>In 1966 Scott visited Antarctica, and was one of the first to appreciate its wildlife and the threats facing it. He revisited the southern continent several times as it became gradually more accessible, being a strong supporter of environmentally oriented tourism as a means of protecting wilderness areas. In 1979 he visited the Falkland Islands and met a number of other conservationists on New Island where they agreed on the need for a new organisation to help protect the natural and cultural heritage of the Islands. This resulted in the establishment later that year of the Falkland Islands Foundation for Wildlife, Wrecks and Places of Historic Interest, (now Falklands Conservation) and he served as its first Chairman. Falklands Conservation has since grown into a very effective and respected organisation. It has had a significant and beneficial impact on the Falklands ecosystem, helping Islanders to appreciate their environment and natural history more fully, and making the Falklands a much respected example of sustainable development.</p><p>In addition to his work as a conservationist he was an accomplished broadcaster, author and illustrator. He wrote 18 books, including his autobiography <em>Eye of the Wind </em>, and illustrated 20 others. His paintings sold easily and are now much sought after. He was awarded a CBE in 1953, a knighthood in 1973, Fellowship of the Royal Society and a Companion of Honour, both in 1987. He was married twice and had two daughters: Nicola with his first wife, the novelist, Elizabeth Jane Howard, and Dafila with his second wife, Philippa Talbot-Ponsonby. A truly remarkable man; and while the Falklands were just a small part of his life, his legacy to the Islands is considerable as the achievements of Falklands Conservation demonstrate.</p><p>In 1933, a friend wrote 'Oh dear Peter, have you ever realised how much you walk in the sun'. The son of a national hero and a talented and unusual mother, Peter Scott certainly did 'walk in the sun', achieving so much in so many fields. He was yachtsman, naval commander, glider pilot, artist, skater, author, but his lasting legacy is, as his father had wished, to natural history and to the preservation of our environment. He was one of the individuals who did most for the conservation of the planet during the twentieth century, not only walking in the sun, but passing it on to others. He died in Bristol on 28 August 1989.</p>",

A year later, stipulations were added that the Kosmos agent was required to arrange for the safe reception and storage in Stanley of wool and merchandise in a receiving hulk in Stanley Harbour. In addition, it was agreed that the Kosmos line should provide a small coasting steamer for the delivery of the inter-island mails and for carrying freight. The inter-island steamer, the <em>Malvinas </em>, was withdrawn from service in 1885. Captain Seemann served as the Kosmos agent for a total of six years, being replaced in 1886 by Hugo <a href=\"/biographies/schlottfeldt_hugo\">SCHLOTTFELDT</a>. Seemann's arrival brought an important change in the balance of power among the established commercial interests in Stanley.

        "body": "<p>statesman and baron, the second son of the explorer Sir Ernest <a href=\"/biographies/shackleton_sir\">SHACKLETON</a> and Emily Shackleton, née Dorman was born in London on 15 July 1911. He scarcely knew his father, who died when he was ten, although he revered his memory. He was educated at Radley and Magdalen College Oxford, where he joined the University Exploration Club. With the Club he surveyed the jungles of Sarawak in 1932 and made the first recorded ascent of Mount Mulu, the highest peak in the colony. His next expedition in 1934-5 was to Ellesmere Island in the Canadian Arctic where he over-wintered with Eskimos and when spring came undertook a long sledge journey up the east of the island. On his return he wrote <em>Arctic Journeys </em>and worked for the BBC and the Ministry of Information, before joining the RAF after the outbreak of war. Shackleton served as an intelligence officer in Coastal Command and was twice mentioned in despatches and awarded the OBE for his work in assessing intelligence on German U-boats.</p><p><strong>Into Politics</strong></p><p>After the war, Shackleton sought a seat in Parliament as a Labour candidate. After two defeats, he was elected in a by-election in Preston in 1946. In 1949 he served as junior minister in the Ministry of Supply and then under Herbert Morrison in the Foreign Office until the Labour government was defeated in 1951. He had been re-elected to Preston South in 1950, but lost the seat in 1955. From 1955 to 1964 he was a director of the John Lewis Partnership. In 1958 he was the youngest of the first batch of Life Peers appointed by Harold Macmillan. When Labour regained power in 1964, Harold Wilson appointed him minister of defence for the RAF, a post for which he was particularly suited through his wartime service and genuine affection for the air force. In 1967 he was promoted to the Cabinet as Minister without Portfolio and became in effect the government's troubleshooter, almost literally when he was instructed to go to Aden to try and resolve the problems bedevilling that colony's road to independence. Two visits to Aden, one to Beirut and negotiations in Geneva with the National Liberation Front led to independence and the withdrawal of British troops late in 1967. It was an unhappy and untidy outcome, but could have been much worse.</p><p>Shackleton became heavily involved in plans for the reform of the House of Lords in 1967 but these came to naught when they were rejected by the Commons in 1969. Already leader of the House of Lords, he was appointed paymaster-general in 1968 with responsibility for the new Civil Service Department and for the implementation of the recommendations of the Fulton Report into the Civil Service. With the election of a Conservative government in 1970, he became leader of the opposition in the Lords. Shackleton was devoted to the House of Lords and had an instinctive feel for the house. As leader he showed acute political skills combining knowledge, not least of procedure, with natural charm and humour, determination and persistence and at times no little guile. Although he retired from the Labour Front Bench after the 1974 general election, he continued to take an active part in public life and to play, as a respected elder statesman, an influential role in the Lords, focussing on scientific and environmental matters and increasingly on the Falkland Islands. In 1973 he joined Río Tinto Zinc and became its deputy chairman from 1975-82.</p><p>Shackleton played a key role in establishing the Lords Select Committee on Science and Technology, served on it for twelve years, was its Chairman from 1988-89 and chaired two major enquiries. The first of these was into remote sensing and digital mapping (1983-4) and the impact which these new techniques would have on the work of the Ordnance Survey. The second enquiry into British space policy (1987) advocated more investment in the UK space programme. However it received only a lukewarm response from government though it elicited useful facts and opinions on space policy. Shackleton was also invited by the Labour Home Secretary in 1977 to head a committee to examine the working of the Prevention of Terrorism Acts introduced to contain the threat from Irish terrorism. His committee reported that while the threat from terrorism continued the provisions of the acts could not be dispensed with, although it would be regrettable if these powers should slide into part of permanent legislation.</p><p>In addition to all these activities, Shackleton was an enthusiastic president of the Royal Geographical Society from 1971-74, an Honorary Elder Brother of Trinity House, a Fellow of the Royal Society, chairman of the British Australian Society, of the Remote Sensing Society and of the British Standards Institution. He became a Knight of the Garter in 1974 and was awarded the Australia Cross in 1990.</p><p><strong>The Falkland Islands</strong></p><p>While Shackleton had a special feeling for the South Atlantic region stemming from his father's deep Antarctic involvement, he had never been directly involved with the Islands until 1975 when the Prime Minister, Harold Wilson, asked him to review the potential for the development of the Islands' then stagnant economy. South Georgia was added to the study: 'Does anyone live there?' asked Wilson. 'No' replied Shackleton, 'but my father is buried there'. He recruited a first-rate team of economists (PS Mould, RH Johnson and PJ Williams) and social (RJ Storey), fishery (GC Eddie) and veterinary (HLl Williams) scientists with a small secretariat headed by DS Keeling from the Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office. Shackleton resisted a proposal from the FCO that an Argentine expert should join the team, but in any case President <a href=\"/biographies/peron_juan\">PERON</a> vetoed the idea. Forbidden to transit Argentina, the team flew to Brazil and joined HMS <em>Endurance </em>to reach the Islands. Arriving in January 1976 they spent some four weeks on the Islands, during which time Shackleton managed to call on 30 out of 36 farms. He also sailed on the ice patrol vessel HMS <em>Endurance </em>to visit South Georgia, where he saw his father's grave for the first time. His report of 454 pages was produced in five months and constituted a major survey not only of the economy but also of many other matters including airport expansion, fisheries, possible hydrocarbon development, the subdivision of the large absentee-owned farms, social matters, education and the organization of government. Shackleton later informed a friend that his positive recommendations had been greeted with surprise by the Prime Minister James <a href=\"/biographies/callaghan_leonard\">CALLAGHAN</a> and with no little concern by the FCO. The government had assumed that he would conclude that the development of the Islands was impossible without a close relationship with Argentina. Instead he reported that the Islands could be made viable. In February 1979 Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Secretary Antony Crosland announced that the Government was not prepared to accept his more costly proposals. By the time of the Argentine invasion in 1982 some progress had been made in implementing some minor and less expensive recommendations but none with the more important and costly ones such as major airport expansion and fisheries.</p><p>As soon as it was clear that the Argentine invasion would not succeed, the Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher asked Shackleton to update his 1976 report. Gathering four of his old team (Eddie, Johnson, Storey and Williams), he added SH Pickett from the Highlands and Islands Development Board and PJ Williams from the SIGMA Group with KD Temple from the Cabinet Office as secretary. The team produced a new report, 137 pages long, in less than two months. Shackleton repeated most of the recommendations in his first report, highlighting the importance of the breakup of the large absentee-owned farms to create smaller owner-occupied farms. In this new report he made important new proposals including the creation of a development corporation, the introduction of a fisheries regime and the establishment of a 200-mile fisheries limit. The Conservative Government accepted virtually all of the updated recommendations and by the early 1990s almost all had been implemented or were well under way. The greater prosperity resulting from a fishery regime has done much to enhance self-confidence and initiative in the Islands and to reverse the serious brain drain. Today the Islanders have real faith in the future of their Islands.</p><p>After his first report he continued to champion the cause of the Falklands both in and out of Parliament. He visited the Islands once more in 1985 for the formal opening of Mount Pleasant Airport - particularly satisfying as his second report had described the need for a full size runway as an absolute priority. Using his political acumen and his vast bank of contacts he took the lead in saving the ice patrol vessel HMS <em>Endurance  </em>and ensured its replacement in 1991 by a second ship of the same name. He founded the South West Atlantic Group, which became an influential pro-Falklands lobby. It was therefore fitting that the Islanders showed their gratitude in 1988 by granting him the freedom of Stanley. After his death the Shackleton Scholarship Fund was created in his and his father's memory with a very substantial contribution from the Falkland Islands Government and donations from people in the Islands and in Britain. It awards scholarships designed to increase knowledge of the South Atlantic Region and to enhance the quality of life in the Falkland Islands. He bequeathed his Garter Banner to the Cathedral in Stanley, where it now hangs. He and his memory mean a great deal to the Islanders.</p><p><strong>The Man Himself</strong></p><p>His expedition leader in Sarawak described Shackleton as 'powerfully built, breezy and bouncing' - an apt description. He certainly had great courage, both physical and moral. This was shown in his two expeditions and in the way in which the man who had always taken pride in his physical stamina, confronted the frustrations of enfeebled health. From early childhood until his last days he lived the fullest of full lives. For him friendship meant a great deal. He was exceptionally gregarious with friends of all ages and greatly enjoyed the social scene and with it good cheer, good company and, when the moment was propitious, going out on the town. He had, too, a keen enjoyment of sport - above all skiing - to a ripe old age and a lifelong addiction to ocean swimming and surfing. With all this went a deeply serious and engaged side and great continuity of interest. From his early years exploration meant much to him and so it continued all his life. So too with his other interests: geography in the widest sense, the whole area where government and politics and science interact and those issues or organizations which he had made particularly his own.</p><p>Shackleton was an intensely loyal man: to his country, albeit not uncritically; to his Party; to his friends; and to the causes which he made his own. Above all he was loyal to his family which meant so much to him. He married Betty Homan in 1938. They had two children: Alexandra (b1940) and Charles (1942-1979). He died of a stroke in Lymington, Hants on 22 September 1994.</p><p>It was the great good fortune of the Falkland Islands that they attracted his interest and affection and that he became their friend and champion at a time when their future looked bleak and when others had lost interest. He sketched the outline of the Islands' current prosperity in his 1977 report, confirmed it in 1982, and lived to see the Falklands liberated, secure, prosperous and economically self-reliant.</p><p><a href=\"?q=node/93\">See Image 71</a></p>",

The Shackletons moved first to Dublin and then, in 1884, to London. In 1887 Shackleton entered Dulwich College but in 1890, aged 16, he left to become a boy on the sailing ship  <em>Hoghton Tower </em>. His first voyage took him around Cape Horn to Valparaiso, Chile. In 1896, he qualified as first mate and two years later gained his master's certificate. He joined the Union Castle Line in 1899 and sailed as third officer on  <em>Tintagel Castle </em>on trooping runs to Cape Town during the Boer War.</p><p>By using an introduction to Llewellyn Longstaff, a major benefactor of the National Antarctic Expedition (1901-1904) under the command of Robert Falcon Scott, Shackleton was able to obtain an appointment on RRS  <em>Discovery </em>as third lieutenant in charge of holds, stores, provisions and seawater analysis.  <em>Discovery </em>remained in the Antarctic and was used as the expedition base. This allowed Shackleton to take part in journeys of exploration. On November 2 1902 Scott, Edward Wilson and Shackleton set out on the centrepiece southern journey with the aim of getting as far south as possible - perhaps even to the South Pole. In the event, they were forced to turn for home on December 31, at 82°15', 480 statute miles from the Pole, having travelled 300 miles beyond the previous farthest south. All three men suffered from scurvy, with Shackleton suffering the most. Although he recovered well, he was invalided home, greatly disappointed, on the relief ship  <em>Morning </em>.</p><p><strong>The Nimrod Expedition</strong></p><p>In early 1904, Shackleton was elected secretary to the Royal Scottish Geographical Society. This post enabled him to marry Emily Dorman, a friend of one of his sisters, whom he had met in 1897. They had three children, Raymond (b1905), Cecily (b1906) and Edward, later Lord <a href=\"/biographies/shackleton_sir\">SHACKLETON</a> (b1911). Shackleton soon resigned from the RSGS in order to stand as a Unionist candidate for Dundee in the General Election, but he came fourth in the poll. There followed a rather ill-defined sinecure with the industrialist William Beardmore who guaranteed a loan of £7000 which allowed Shackleton to launch the British Antarctic Expedition in February 1907. Put together in an amazingly short time, the expedition sailed on 7 August in the Dundee sealer  <em>Nimrod </em>, having first visited Cowes, where King Edward VII inspected the ship and conferred the Royal Victorian Order on Shackleton, while Queen Alexandra gave him a flag.</p><p>As well as serious shortfalls in finance, Shackleton's expedition was hampered in executing its objectives of reaching the South Magnetic Pole as well as the geographical Pole by an agreement with Scott that he would not encroach on the McMurdo Sound area which the latter considered his preserve.  <em>Nimrod </em>arrived at Lyttelton, New Zealand, and on November 23 was towed south by the steamer  <em>Koonya </em>to save coal. Shackleton was unable to find a site for a base at the eastern end of the Ross Ice Shelf and had to turn back to McMurdo Sound. The shore party was landed at Cape Royds, close to the old  <em>Discovery </em>headquarters at Hut Point. Shackleton's plan was to reach the South Pole with the aid of an Arrol-Johnston motorcar and a team of Manchurian ponies. Both means of transport failed to live up to expectation and Shackleton, with Frank Wild, Eric Marshall and Jameson Boyd Adams, were forced to drag their sledges on foot after the motor had broken down and the ponies had died or been killed. They reached 88°23'S, less than 100 miles from the Pole, before shortage of food forced them to retreat. If they had not lost the last pony down a crevasse, they would have had enough food to reach the Pole. As it was, they had a horrific trek back, suffering from starvation exacerbated by dysentery. On 27 February, Marshall collapsed and, with  <em>Nimrod </em>due to leave in two days, Shackleton and Wild set off on the last 33 miles to get help. They reached the  <em>Discovery </em>hut to find it empty but next day attracted  <em>Nimrod's </em>attention. Shackleton immediately set out with the rescue party and brought Adams and Marshall in. After all the privations of the 1500 mile trek, he had finally covered nearly 100 miles without proper sleep. A second party consisting of Edgeworth David, Douglas Mawson and Alistair Mackay attained the South Magnetic Pole and a party of six made the first ascent of Mt Erebus.</p><p>Shackleton's attempt on the South Pole was the essential journey of geographical discovery. He pioneered the route up the Beardmore Glacier and showed that the south polar region is a high ice-covered plateau. Covering the last 100 miles to reach the Pole would not add significantly to human knowledge. In his wife's words:</p><blockquote><blockquote>The only comment he made to me about not reaching the Pole was \"a live donkey is better than a dead lion, isn't it?\" and I said \"Yes darling, as far as I am concerned\" and we left it at that.</blockquote></blockquote><p>The expedition returned home in triumph. Shackleton had become a national hero and was knighted.</p><p><strong>The Imperial Transantarctic Expedition - Endurance</strong></p><p>Once again Shackleton failed to settle down, socially or professionally, and in December 1911 he announced plans for the Imperial Transantarctic Expedition to cross the continent from the Weddell Sea to the Ross Sea via the South Pole, a journey of about 1800 miles. A second sledging party would travel towards Graham Land and third would head eastward toward Enderby Land. From another base in McMurdo Sound, a support party would lay a depot at the top of the Beardmore Glacier for the transcontinental party to pick up.</p><p>The idea of crossing Antarctica was not original. It had been proposed by William Spiers <a href=\"/biographies/bruce_william\">BRUCE</a> after his own expedition into the Weddell Sea but he could not raise the funds and agreed to Shackleton using his plan. Funding was also a problem for Shackleton but he eventually received £24,000 from the Scottish jute magnate Sir James Caird, £10,000 from the British government and lesser donations from Dudley Docker, Dame Janet Stancomb-Wills and Elizabeth Dawson-Lambton. Many public schools contributed to purchasing dogs. A Norwegian ship  <em>Polaris </em>, strongly-built but not ideal for the expedition's purpose, was purchased for £11,600 and renamed  <em>Endurance </em>(from the Shackleton family motto  <em>Fortitudine vincimus </em>- By endurance we conquer). The second ship  <em>Aurora </em>was purchased for £3,200 from Douglas Mawson, the Australian explorer who had been on the  <em>Nimrod  </em>expedition. Preparations were rushed and in places skimped, but Shackleton engaged the Army's nutrition expert, Colonel Wilfred Beveridge, to devise nutritious sledging rations to prevent scurvy, arranged for 100 sledge dogs to be brought over from Canada and devised propeller-driven sledges.</p><p> <em>Endurance </em>sailed from England at the outbreak of World War I. On hearing that general mobilisation had been ordered, Shackleton put the resources of the expedition at the disposal of the Admiralty. The reply came in a one-word telegram -  <em>Proceed </em>- which was backed up by a letter from Winston Churchill. Shackleton also received support from King <a href=\"/biographies/george_v\">GEORGE</a> V. However, he continued to be concerned that he should not be leaving the country at such a time.</p><p>Shackleton joined  <em>Endurance </em>at Buenos Aires on 27 September. There he announced that he would sail to South Georgia rather than the Falkland Islands. His appearance at Grytviken on 5 November surprised the Norwegian whalers. They advised him that he should delay his departure for the Weddell Sea because it was a bad year for pack-ice. During their month's stay,  <em>Endurance  </em>visited several of the whaling stations, taking on coal and other supplies, and the scientists were able to work ashore. The expedition finally set sail on 5 December and in three days reached the edge of the pack-ice. Coats Land on the southern coast of the Weddell Sea was sighted on 10 January. Shackleton was heading for the farthest south, Vahsel Bay, to reduce the length of the continental crossing, but he never got there.  <em>Endurance </em>was beset in ice 25 miles away and, when it was clear they would not get clear, ship's routine was abandoned and the company prepared for a long winter.</p><p>The salvation of the expedition lay in the Weddell Gyre, the ocean current that circulates clockwise in the Weddell Sea.  <em>Endurance </em>slowly drifted northwards with Shackleton exercising his powers of leadership to maintain morale during the long Antarctic night and as the pressure of the ice-floes started to batter  <em>Endurance.  </em>Eventually, she sprang a leak and, when timbers began to crack, the men abandoned ship and set up 'Dump Camp' in tents on an ice-floe. Shackleton had several options. One was to cross the coast of Graham Land (now the Antarctic Peninsula) and sail in search of the Norwegian whalers who operated in the sheltered waters on the west coast. The best option was to head for Paulet Island and thence to the whaling station on Deception Island. Paulet Island had been the refuge of the crew of  <em>Antarctic </em>, the ship of Otto <a href=\"/biographies/nordenskjold_nils\">NORDENSKJÖLD</a>'s Swedish expedition, after it had been crushed by ice in 1902. They had not only built a solid hut but, when helping to organise their relief, Shackleton had suggested leaving any unused stores for future emergencies. It would have been a nice story if he had benefited from his own foresight!</p><p>Three days later, the party set out dragging two boats on sledges in the direction of Grahamland. Conditions underfoot forced them to give up after they had moved only 1½ miles so a more permanent camp, Ocean Camp, was established on a large ice-floe. The wreck of  <em>Endurance </em>was raided for more food and equipment and the men lived in reasonable comfort as the northward drift continued. Nevertheless, Shackleton trained the men in emergency procedures in case the floe broke up or pressure rafted more floes over it. By late December the floe was starting to disintegrate and another attempt was made at travelling. This time they kept going for a week until compelled to make camp again. This was aptly named Patience Camp because they were now forced to stay put until the pack-ice opened and they could take to the boats. Travel over the floes had become too dangerous to risk visiting Ocean Camp to collect the gear they had left behind, except for a dash to get the third boat.</p><p>Patience Camp was abandoned on 9 April, at the end of the Antarctic summer, when they were about 60 miles from Paulet Island. The three boats,  <em>James Caird </em>,  <em>Dudley Docker  </em>and  <em>Stancomb-Wills </em>, <em> </em>were launched and the crews threaded their way between the floes. The next six days formed the nadir of the expedition. The men became severely debilitated as they suffered from seasickness, hunger, thirst, fatigue, frostbite and fear. At times the boats were nearly swamped or were driven by currents away from their destination. Shackleton decided that a landfall on inhospitable Elephant Island was essential before some men succumbed but this was not easy to achieve. Almost miraculously, all three boats made landfall at Cape Valentine. However, the small beach was backed by cliffs and gave no shelter from storms so the party moved to Point Wild.</p><p><strong>The Epic Journey to South Georgia - James Caird</strong></p><p>From Elephant Island, Shackleton set out in the 22 foot  <em>James Caird </em>with Worsley, Crean, McNish, McCarty and Vincent on one of the most famous boat journeys in history. Battling high seas and ferocious storms and suffering immense privations they took 16 days to reach King Haakon Bay on the south-west coast of South Georgia.</p><p>The whaling stations lay on the other side of the Island and both the men and their boat were too frail to sail round the island so Shackleton, Worsley and Crean walked across it. The interior of the island was unknown and they had hopes of finding an easy route but mountains and glaciers lay in the way. Ill-equipped and untrained for mountaineering, but with sheer determination and immense luck with the weather, the trio found a route that led them to Stromness whaling station in a gruelling 36 hour trek. They were taken to the manager Thoralf <a href=\"/biographies/sorlle_thoralf\">SØRLLE</a>, who failed to recognise them at first but then welcomed them in for baths, a change of clothes and dinner. While Shackleton and Crean went to bed in the manager's house, Worsley was despatched in the whalecatcher  <em>Samson </em>to fetch the other three who were camping under the upturned  <em>James Caird </em>on the shores of King Haakon Bay. A hint of the effect of the ordeal is shown in a letter from Søren <a href=\"/biographies/berntsen_soren\">BERNTSEN</a>, manager of the Husvik whaling station, in which he describes Crean and Worsley crying out in their sleep as they relived the  <em>James Caird </em>'s voyage.</p><p>The whalecatcher  <em>Southern Sky </em>was hastily fitted out to relieve the men on Elephant Island. Captain Ingvar Thom, captain of the transport ship  <em>Orwell </em>, was in command and, accompanied by Shackleton, Worsley and Crean, set out on 23 May. Seventy miles from the island the pack-ice forced them to retreat. They returned to Stanley where Shackleton would have access to the telegraph, arriving on 31 May. According to the magazine  <em>John Bull </em>, Shackleton was not well received in Stanley: ' ...not a soul seemed to care one scrap!...An old kelper remarked, \"'E ought ter 'ave been at the war long ago instead of messing about on icebergs\" .' If this was more than a journalist's invention, the response of the Falkland Islanders contrasted with the enthusiastic welcomes of the Norwegians and later the Chileans. The account was clearly incorrect in describing Shackleton arriving on  <em>Southern Sky </em>with a beard and shoulder-length hair. In a later issue,  <em>John Bull </em>had to explain 'In view of the controversy excited by a recent article we point out...(the) Expedition's departure at mobilisation was requested by Admiralty and the King.'</p><p>However, Shackleton was well received by the governor, Douglas <a href=\"/biographies/young_sir\">YOUNG</a>, who invited him to stay at Government House. Thom took  <em>Southern Sky </em>back to South Georgia to rejoin his own ship  <em>Orwell </em>. He returned to Port Sunlight, Liverpool, taking McNish, MacCarthy and Vincent, and the  <em>James Caird </em>. Shackleton's frustrations continued. The British Government reluctantly sanctioned the fitting-out of  <em>Discovery </em>for a relief expedition but it would take months for her to reach Elephant Island. So Shackleton determined to continue his own attempts at rescue. While telegrams were exchanged with the outside world, Shackleton could only wait. He wrote that his chief distraction was to walk along the front at Stanley, from the slaughterhouse to the graveyard and, for a change, from the graveyard to the slaughterhouse.</p><p>Several offers of help were made and the Uruguayan Government loaned Shackleton the trawler  <em>Instituto de Pesca No 1 </em>but the ice turned it away in sight of Elephant Island. They returned to Stanley and sailed for Punta Arenas, Chile, where British and Chilean residents donated £1500 to charter the 75 ton schooner  <em>Emma </em>.  <em>Emma </em>was towed part of the way by  <em>Yelcho </em>, a small steamer, but was stopped by ice 100 miles short of Elephant Island Once again there was a return to Stanley where it was reported that Shackleton had to be helped ashore 'suffering from rheumatics and cramps from the exposure, damp, worry and anxiety'.  <em>Emma </em>was then escorted back to Punta Arenas by  <em>Yelcho </em>with Shackleton on board. The Chilean Government now loaned  <em>Yelcho </em>, under the command of Captain Luis Pardo, for a fourth attempt, which was successful. The stranded men had lived a precarious life on Elephant Island for 105 days.</p><p>This was not the conclusion of the Imperial Transantarctic Expedition. The fate of the Ross Sea party was unknown. They became known as 'Shackleton's Forgotten Men' because their tribulations have been overshadowed by the story of the  <em>Endurance </em>.  <em>Aurora </em>had set sail from Hobart on 24 December 1914, ill-equipped and underfunded. It arrived at Cape Evans on 16 January 1916. It was late in the season but it was not known when Shackleton's transcontinental party might appear. So, despite several setbacks and hardgoing, a depot was established at 80°S. Meanwhile, however,  <em>Aurora </em>had been blown out to sea and could not get back. The men stranded on shore were left very short of provisions and equipment. They survived the winter and next summer they managed to lay another depot at the foot of the Beardmore Glacier. On the way back three men were lost: the Rev A Spencer-Smith died of scurvy, while Aeneas Mackintosh, the leader, and VG Hayward were lost when sea-ice was blown out. After the survivors had eked out another miserable winter,  <em>Aurora </em>with Shackleton on board picked them up.</p><p>Although, at 42, Shackleton was exempt from military service, he was determined to serve but it was difficult to find him a suitable role. He was sent to Buenos Aires for a short period on a propaganda mission to bolster the allied cause and on his return he was gazetted major to act as equipment officer at Murmansk for a British expeditionary force fighting the Bolsheviks. Also present were Worsley, Macklin and Hussey from  <em>Endurance </em>, as well as men from Scott's expeditions. After five months, (October 1918 - February 1919) Shackleton was back in England and demobilised. For half a year after the war, he lectured on the  <em>Endurance </em>expedition and by 1920 was planning his next expedition. This was to explore the Canadian Arctic but expected support from the Canadian Government did not materialise. Instead, he decided to head south again. With the financial support of John Quiller Rowett, an old school friend, the aim of the Shackleton-Rowett expedition was to circumnavigate Antarctica and carry out oceanographic research.</p><p><strong>The Last Expedition - Quest</strong></p><p> <em>Quest  </em>sailed from London on September 17, 1921 and reached South Georgia on 4 January. For Shackleton and Worsley it was a return to the scene of their desperate but triumphant crossing of the island eight years earlier. They found old friends among the whalers at Grytviken and prepared to celebrate a delayed Christmas. That night Shackleton suffered a fatal heart attack as Macklin was administering medicine. It was agreed that the expedition would continue under Wild's command while Shackleton's body was escorted back to England by Hussey. It was carried on the floating factory ship,  <em>Professor Gruvel </em>to Montevideo. However, Lady Shackleton requested that her husband be buried at South Georgia and Hussey returned with the body on a British ship,  <em>Woodville </em>. By this time,  <em>Quest </em>and her crew had left for the Antarctic and Hussey was the only member of the expedition at Shackleton's funeral which was held on 5 March 1922, with the magistrate Edward <a href=\"/biographies/binnie_edward\">BINNIE</a> officiating. The present headstone of Scottish granite was brought down in 1928 and unveiled by the governor of the Falkland Islands, Sir Arnold <a href=\"/biographies/hodson_sir\">HODSON</a>. It bears a misquotation of words of Shackleton's favourite poet, Robert Browning: 'I hold that a man should strive to the uttermost for his life's set prize'.</p><p>Although Shackleton's reputation was for a long time eclipsed by Scott's, it has enjoyed a remarkable revival. It is not surprising that his death is now generally accepted as the final event in the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration. The origin of what the  <em>New Yorker </em>described as 'Shackletonmania' is not clear. It was greatly enhanced by a spate of books and films but these were more the result of an increasing interest in the drama of the  <em>Endurance </em>story and Shackleton's abilities as a leader. His style of leadership which emphasised his care for his men and easy communication with them, as well as the charm that captivated people of all ranks from Emperors to cab drivers, accords with modern concepts of leadership. Shackleton Schools teach leadership in the United States and books for business people extol leadership 'the Shackleton way'.</p><p>The explorer Apsley Cherry Garrard compared Shackleton with three other great Antarctic pioneers thus:</p><blockquote><blockquote>For a joint scientific and geographical piece of organisation, give me Scott; for a Winter Journey, Wilson; for a dash to the Pole and nothing else, Amundsen; and if I am in the devil of a hole and want to get out of it, give me Shackleton every time.</blockquote></blockquote>",

        "body": "<p>American artist, was born on 2 August 1947 in Lakeport, California, the son of Sara and John Sheridan. His father, a construction superintendent, was also an extraordinary painter and draftsman who nurtured his son's talent. Sheridan left college after three years to practice his art full-time. Shortly thereafter he met and married Jeanne Pannell.</p><p>In 1971, after the birth of their first son, Elisha, the Sheridans discovered the Baha'i Faith. Inspired by the teachings of Baha'u'llah, they were eager to be of service to humanity. When they were invited to visit the Falkland Islands to assist the Baha'i community there, they gladly agreed, even though they thought the remote location would end Sheridan's art career.</p><p>When they applied for employment permits, Jeanne Sheridan got a call from the Secretariat, asking if she could type. When she demonstrated that she could, she was asked to 'come to work on Monday'. This made it possible for Sheridan to concentrate on his painting. So Sheridan's seven years in the Falklands proved to be the most important period of refining his skills and becoming internationally recognized as one of the group of \"Living Masters™\" of the art world. When asked what art school he attended, Sheridan answers, 'the Falklands'.</p><p>He received a number of commissions, including portraits and a triptych panorama of Rincon Grande. In the late 1970s, Outward Bound Travel began arranging for groups of Argentine tourists to visit the Islands weekly. Among the stops on their itinerary were the Museum, a penguin colony, and Sheridan's studio. As a result, Sheridan was invited to exhibit 25 paintings in Mar del Plata.</p><p>There were times when he took on less delicate work: he painted the Falkland Islands Company lighter, signs like the large king penguin advertising the Travel Agency, and windows and doors at the new boarding school building in Stanley. During the Argentine occupation, he worked with the Public Works Department painting the Spanish word '<em>Basura </em>' on rubbish bins.</p><p>In April 1981, their second son, Maxwell, was born in Stanley. From July to November, the family travelled back to the United States. Jeanne Sheridan had prepared a slide show about Falkland Islands life accompanied by an audio tape produced at the Falkland Islands Broadcasting Station. This presentation was made in 44 cities in 33 different states during their 17,000 mile circuit of the USA.</p><p>To commemorate the 150th Anniversary of the Falkland Islands, Sheridan and Ian Strange were commissioned by the Falkland Islands Government to produce a series of eleven postage stamps, depicting historical events from 1833. Sheridan painted the vignettes for each stamp and Strange created the borders and script. The original artwork was sent to London on the last plane before the Argentine invasion.</p><p>In 1982, Sheridan was commissioned by the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of the United States to create an exhibition of his Falkland Island paintings, which was shown at the Royal Festival Hall in London and in cities throughout the United States. The exhibition generated a great deal of publicity for the Islands, including a cover story in the London <em>Sunday Times Magazine. </em></p><p>Sheridan served on the Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of Stanley for seven years. He and his family remained in Stanley during the Falklands war and for a year afterwards. Sir Rex <a href=\"/biographies/hunt_sir\">HUNT</a>, on his return as civil commissioner, appointed Sheridan to the Rehabilitation Committee. Sheridan says he 'never met anyone in the Falklands who didn't have a great story - including us'.</p>",

        "body": " <p>French gaucho and foreman, first appears in the <a href=\"/biographies/vernet_louis\">VERNET</a> financial accounts as a gaucho paid for guarding Vernet's horses near Río Negro in November 1825. Simon is first mentioned actually in the Falklands in May 1829, just as a gaucho. There are several further references to him in 1830 doing ordinary jobs, once in company with Antonio <a href=\"/biographies/rivero_antonio\">RIVERO</a>. At some stage Simon became  <em>capataz </em>, or foreman of the gauchos, and he came to prominence in 1832 during the  <em>Lexington </em>raid when he opposed the departure of Henry Metcalf, Vernet's deputy, as this left no one who could read or write in the settlement. He also objected to Metcalf taking with him what Simon considered to be Vernet's property. After all the European settlers had departed on the  <em>Lexington </em>in January 1832, Simon was effectively the leader of the fourteen or so gauchos that stayed behind. They lived in fear of foreign vessels whose captains slaughtered both tame and wild animals. More welcome were vessels with supplies for Vernet, but Simon turned some of these away as he was not authorised to receive the goods.</p><p>Everything changed when the schooner  <em>Sarandi </em>arrived on 6 October 1832, bringing Metcalf and, more importantly, Etienne <a href=\"/biographies/mestivier_joseph\">MESTIVIER</a>, a French army officer, as provisional political and military commander. Simon clearly resented the loss of his position as leader. When Mestivier was brutally murdered in a mutiny on 30 November, Simon was prominent among those who restored order. Helped by crew from the French whaling vessel  <em>Jean Jacques, </em>Captain Guerin, Simon surprised the mutineers near Estancia. They were taken onboard the British schooner  <em>Rapid </em>on 8 December 1832 and placed in irons. Then the  <em>Sarandi </em>returned on the night of 29 December, and its commander Jose Maria PINEDO took charge. But HMS <em>Clio </em>arrived on 2 January 1833 and Captain <a href=\"/biographies/onslow_john\">ONSLOW</a> told the  <em>Sarandi </em>to leave. On 3 January Pinedo told Simon he was to be political and military commander and should keep the Argentine flag flying, so that for some the illiterate Simon can be listed, however implausibly, as one of the Argentine 'governors' of the Falklands. He never attempted to act as such, and the Argentine flag was replaced by the Union Jack that same day.</p><p>Onslow reported the difficulty he had in persuading 12 of the gauchos to stay. They pleaded to be paid in silver - not in Vernet's paper currency and Onslow told Simon to do this. In March 1833, Vernet sent the  <em>Rapid  </em>back to the settlement with <a href=\"/biographies/brisbane_matthew\">BRISBANE</a> and Pasos on board. Simon was accused of defrauding Vernet and had a letter of rebuttal prepared. But authority had been hopelessly undermined and on 26 August, Simon, Brisbane, and three others were murdered by Vernet's Churrua Indians and rebel gauchos, led by Antonio Rivero. Vernet did not hear of these deaths until much later and did not even know where to find Simon's next of kin. Posthumously, he accepted that Simon had not defrauded him.</p><p>But Simon may have had kin of a sort, and left a legacy of sorts too. A report of 18 September 1839, on the inhabitants of Port Louis by Lieutenant <a href=\"/biographies/lowcay_robert\">LOWCAY</a>, mentions Mrs Gregoria Parry, wife of Henry Parry, master of the schooner  <em>Alonso </em>: she had two sons - 'son 1 of union with  <em>capataz </em>that was murdered'. That must refer to Jean Simon.</p>",

His father was a schoolmaster but died when Skottsberg was 6 years old, and a few years later, the family - mother and four children - moved to Stockholm. After high school in Stockholm he went to university in Uppsala and obtained his PhD in botany in 1907, becoming an assistant professor there the same year. In 1919 he became professor in Gothenburg and later, in 1934-35, at Yale University in the United States. He was awarded an honorary PhD by Montpellier University in France in 1959.</p><p>He participated in the Swedish South Polar Expedition of 1901-1904 together with Otto <a href=\"/biographies/nordenskjold_nils\">NORDENSKJÖLD</a> and CA <a href=\"/biographies/larsen_carl\">LARSEN</a> and established his first contacts in the Falkland Islands then. This was useful to him during the Swedish Magellanic Expedition 1907-1909, which he led, when he was able to visit many of the outlying islands in the Falklands to study plants and mosses. Among other places and islands he visited were: Roy Cove, Weddell Island, Beaver Island, New Island, West Point Island, Clifton Station, Hill Cove, Saunders Island, Fox Bay, Port Howard, Darwin, San Carlos and Port Louis. During this expedition he also revisited South Georgia where he had spent some time during the southern autumn of 1902. Later expeditions took him to Juan Fernandez and Easter Island (the Swedish Pacific Expedition 1916-17), Hawaii (1922, 1926, 1938, 1948), Tunisia (1924), Japan and Ceylon {Sri Lanka} (1926), Java (1929), Morocco (1936), New Zealand (1938 and 1949), Argentina (1948), Australia and New Caledonia (1949).</p><p>His studies of the vegetation and plants of the Antarctic, sub-Antarctic, South American and Pacific areas have been internationally recognised and have led to a revision of the classification of these plants, emphasising the problems of island plants. During his career he published and was involved in many articles and books including <em>Two Years in the Antarctic </em>(1904), <em>The Wilds of Patagonia </em>(1911), and <em>To Robinson-Island and the End of the World </em>(1918). He was deeply involved in the publication of <em>The Life of Plants </em>(1932-40, 5 volumes, of which he wrote most of vol 5, introducing a new classification for plants).</p><p>He was very active until the day he died, 14 June 1963. He had three children and he has been described as a good family father except when he was involved in organizing, reading, writing or travelling; things he was almost constantly doing!</p>",

        "body": " <p>US consul, was born in 1793 or 1794, most likely in Alexandria, Virginia, the eldest son of a prominent Virginia family headed by Captain George and Mrs Jane H Slacum. While little is known about young George's childhood or education, his father was a well-regarded and quite wealthy merchant. Captain Slacum died at age 54 on 14 October 1810, leaving his widow Jane to care for the family, and leaving his seven slaves to his eldest son, George W.</p><p>Between 1810 and 1818, George W Slacum moved to New York and established a commercial trading house. In the spring of 1818, he travelled to the frontier states of Kentucky and Missouri to explore business opportunities, bearing letters of introduction from well-known East Coast families. On 23 February 1819, seeking a different career, Slacum applied for the position of US consul at Glasgow. Despite letters of recommendation from Supreme Court Justice Bushrod Washington (nephew of George Washington) and Edmond Jennings Lee (uncle of Robert E Lee), Slacum was denied the post. A subsequent application, in February 1821, for the post of commercial agent at Havana was also refused.</p><p>On 19 April 1824, Slacum was finally appointed to the post of US consul at Buenos Aires, where his tenure proved controversial. Although Slacum was, at first, warmly welcomed by the long-serving and highly-regarded US chargé d'affaires in Buenos Aires, John M Forbes, they subsequently clashed repeatedly and publicly. Nevertheless, after Forbes's death in June 1831, Slacum took possession of his official papers and sought to assume the role of US diplomatic representative arguing that he was the sole US government agent in Buenos Aires. Shortly  afterwards, Slacum strongly protested to Argentine Foreign Minister Tomás Manuel de Anchorena, in an exchange which became intemperate, over the seizure in July 1831 of three American vessels accused of sealing without a license by Louis <a href=\"/biographies/vernet_louis\">VERNET</a>, appointed Political and Military Commandant of the Falkland/Malvinas Islands by the Argentine government. Slacum did so because the US government contested the right of Vernet and the Argentine government to restrict or regulate US sealing, whaling or fishing in and around the Islands.</p><p>Slacum was warned by the foreign minister that his protests were unauthorized - as he was only a consul - and could cause retaliation by Argentina. Slacum consulted the British envoys in Buenos Aires, Henry S Fox and Woodbine <a href=\"/biographies/parish_sir\">PARISH</a>. When they informed Slacum of the British claim to the Islands, Slacum shared with them his correspondence with the Argentine government and notified them that he was going to send copies of his correspondence to the US minister in London, Martin Van Buren. In a subsequent letter to US Secretary of State Edward Livingston, Slacum reported this meeting with the British diplomats, indicating that he was going to send copies of his correspondence to Van Buren because an opportunity might exist for 'some understanding between the Government of the United States and that of Great Britain.' In this same letter though, Slacum expressed concern about the British claim and warned Livingston that 'the most powerful reasons exist[ed] why England should not be permitted to colonise those Islands....' Slacum also warned Livingston, (perhaps as a veiled recommendation for US occupation) that the Islands should not become a haven for adventurers, leaving US 'commerce round the Cape ... exposed to robbery and destruction....'</p><p>In late November 1831, Commander Silas <a href=\"/biographies/duncan_silas\">DUNCAN</a> (USS  <em>Lexington </em>) arrived in the River Plate, referred to his duty to protect US citizens and commerce, and asked Slacum about the US ships captured by Vernet. Slacum replied that he thought it advisable to 'call that protection into requisition,' characterizing Vernet's seizure of the vessels as 'violent and illegal.' Duncan then sailed for the Islands, arriving at the Argentine settlement in the Islands on 28 December. He raided the storehouses, recovered the American cargos seized by Vernet, spiked the settlement's cannon, set fire to the powder, and arrested Vernet's director of seal fisheries, Mathew <a href=\"/biographies/brisbane_matthew\">BRISBANE</a>, and six other subordinates of Vernet. Duncan also induced most of the settlers to leave on the  <em>Lexington.  </em>Duncan released the seven prisoners and the settlers in Montevideo, after receiving notification from the government of Buenos Aires that Vernet and his subordinates had acted under its authority.</p><p>After what the <em>Lexington </em>had done became known in Buenos Aires, the Argentine government withdrew recognition from Slacum as consul. Later, Slacum took refuge in the house of the newly arrived US Chargé Francis Baylies to avoid arrest by the Argentine police, after they discovered that he was going to fight a duel. When Baylies abandoned his negotiations with the Argentines over the  <em>Lexington  </em>affair, and asked for his passports, he appointed Slacum private secretary and part of the 'diplomatic family.' Baylies did this to give Slacum diplomatic immunity in order to protect him from the Buenos Aires police and possibly from an attempted civil suit for slander by Vernet. Slacum left Buenos Aires with Baylies and his staff on the US frigate  <em>Warren </em>.  This however, did not end his career in the US consular service. He served as US consul at Río de Janeiro, starting in 1837, and then declined a subsequent appointment as US consul at Acapulco, Mexico in 1852.</p><p>George W Slacum passed away after a long illness on 9 March 1861 at the age of 67 in his sister's home at Covington, Kentucky.</p>",

He sought a post in the colonial service and was appointed clerk to Governor <a href=\"/biographies/moody_richard\">MOODY</a> at Port Louis, arriving in the brigantine <em>Columbian Packet </em>on 23 November 1843. Slaughter was not a success: Moody wrote to the Secretary of State in November 1844 asking that he be replaced as he was of a 'constitutionally morbid ... or nervously anxious state of mind'. Slaughter had cause to be nervous: the officers of the survey ship <em>Philomel </em>had been accustomed to use his Stanley house on Philomel Street as a base on shore, (in his words) 'spitting on his carpet in his sitting room, smashing his furniture and even ... pushing him from his chair on the floor'. On 28 March 1845 he found five officers awaiting his return from church smoking cigars in a scene of wreckage. They produced a sack and threatened to take Slaughter back on board; after a scuffle, he slipped from the house and ran down Ross Road to Stanley Cottage (Dr <a href=\"/biographies/hamblin_henry\">HAMBLIN</a>'s house) with the officers in hot pursuit. Here Hamblin's mother-in-law, Mrs Louisa Longden, admitted the unfortunate Slaughter and sent his pursuers packing. The governor took a dim view of this incident and reported it to the Admiralty, who however were less concerned.</p><p>The following year Slaughter complained that his salary of £100 would not cover his expenses which amounted to £146, and later informed Moody that ' circumstances of a private nature, including the state of my health' obliged him to return to England. He left for home in September 1846, having thanked Moody for 'all the great acts of considerate kindness'. For several succeeding years he wrote to the Colonial Office seeking employment but received discouraging replies. In the 1881 census he was living in Devon.</p>",

        "body": "<p>manager, was born near Bolsover, Derbyshire on 23 June 1880, the third of the eight children of Dr John Slaughter and Edith Slaughter, née Jarvis. The early death of his father meant that money was too short to allow him to study medicine, and after two years on a dairy farm he sailed for Patagonia and joined the Waldrons and Wood farm at Delgado. Here he learnt every aspect of sheep farming, which also included hunting pumas and bartering with Twelshe Indians for guanaco skins, as well as such unpleasant tasks as plucking wool from disintegrating sheep carcasses. He soon proved himself a good rider and was allowed to choose his own colts and break them himself - which entailed staying in the saddle until the bucking ceased - a skill for which he became renowned.</p><p>In 1908 he agreed to help a Chilean company with a sheep drive northwest through the Andes towards Lake Cochrane. Slaughter met up with the drovers on the River Baker: their flock had dwindled from 20,000 to 16,500 after three months on the trail. Descending the river, with repeated crossings, the sheep were caught by a flash flood with only 20 miles to go, and 12,000 drowned. Keeping two of the drovers (who were wanted for bank robbery) Slaughter camped out through a harsh winter, before returning by ship to Punta Arenas where he learnt that the Chilean company had gone bankrupt. He then went on leave to England.</p><p>In 1909, he went to run Waldrons' lands in the Matto Grosso in Brazil. It was a wild area, beyond the railhead, with Indians, squatters, a corrupt police force and tropical diseases afflicting men and horses. Deals in cattle were all for cash and Slaughter was an unusually good judge of character, who would advance money to buyers to acquire cattle for him. Although not normally a fighter, he led the workers from the railhead against the police who were brutal and corrupt. The police were routed and law and order restored. In 1914, he returned to England to enlist in the XVI Lancers and was wounded in France. He was then commissioned in the Glosters and served out the war, becoming a captain.</p><p>Still affected by malaria, he did not return to Brazil, but accepted the post of Camp manager for the Falkland Islands Company, based at Darwin. Slaughter arrived in 1919, and was soon engaged to Muriel, the daughter of George <a href=\"/biographies/bonner_george\">BONNER</a> at San Carlos. They married in 1921 and had two children: Dick (b1922) and Eileen (b1923). As babies they were carried on horseback and from the age of four rode on <em>cojinillas  </em>(sheepskins). Although there were no roads, Slaughter imported a Model T Ford and pioneered motoring south of Stanley. (The car featured on a Falklands stamp of 1988). Sometimes in summer he would drive as far as Mount Pleasant and then complete the journey to Stanley by horse. Family fishing picnics often ended with the shepherds coming with horses to tow the car out of soft ground. In 1925 the Irish yachtsman, Conor <a href=\"/biographies/obrien_edward\">O'BRIEN</a>, stayed at Darwin and through him Slaughter ordered a boat for the FIC - the <em>Ilen </em>, later sailed down to the Islands by O'Brien himself, arriving early in 1927.</p><p>The family left the Falklands in 1931 and the following year rented a farm in Gloucestershire. But prices were poor and in 1937 Slaughter sold up. In 1939 he managed a farm in Herefordshire originally to export Corriedale rams for Reginald <a href=\"/biographies/pole-evans_reginald\">POLE-EVANS</a> and Robert Greenshields. The war put a stop to this, but he farmed on until 1948, when he retired. He settled by the Debden estuary in Suffolk, where the sailing was good. On 20 March 1962 he died at Wickham Market in Suffolk. He had been a highly respected employer, able to do any task he asked his men to do. He was quick tempered but never harboured a grudge and had a dry sense of humour. His horsemanship, both in the hunting field and abroad, was legendary.</p>",

        "body": "<p>medical officer, was born in Fraserburgh, Scotland, on 2 November 1912. His father, Dr Robert Slessor, was a local physician, and he had one brother and two sisters. He was educated at Fraserburgh Academy, Aberdeen Grammar School, Kiel University, Aberdeen University and Trinity College Dublin, gaining bachelors degrees in medicine and surgery.</p><p>Before the war, Slessor worked in Plymouth, in Berlin, and as a gynaecologist at the Rotunda Hospital in Dublin where he became its assistant master. He joined the RNVR as a surgeon lieutenant-commander in October, 1941 and served eighteen months aboard the destroyer HMS <em>Wanderer </em>, during which time he was mentioned in despatches for skilfully amputating a seaman's leg during a storm. In April 1943, Slessor was appointed to the WRNS Hospital in Vincent Square, London, becoming deputy to the former polar explorer Surgeon Commander EW 'Ted' Bingham who was its officer-in-charge.</p><p>When Bingham became commander of the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey in 1945, he asked Slessor to be his second-in-command and to set off to Labrador almost immediately to buy a second batch of sledge dogs to boost the small stock that Bingham himself had selected for Operation Tabarin* at Hope Bay in 1944. Slessor and his companion, Tom O'Sullivan, knew nothing about dogs, or sledging, but they did their best in buying dogs from various coastal settlements, and in getting fifty-four of them, plus ten newly born puppies, to Port Stanley aboard <em>Trepassey </em>. On New Year's Day, 1946, Slessor stepped ashore to begin a long association with the Falkland Islands.</p><p>In 1946 he was medical officer in the team that built, and wintered at, the first British base on Stonington Island. There, he cared for both dogs and men, and led a pioneering traverse along the crest of the Antarctic Peninsula as far north as the Antarctic Circle. The highest mountain in that area is now known as Slessor Peak, and he was awarded the Polar Medal for his services. His Antarctic diary, now in BAS Archives, hints at, without revealing, the burden of ill health and the anxieties of leadership that Bingham carried that year.</p><p>His liking for the Antarctic, his experience, discretion and judgement made him the ideal person to accompany and guide Bingham's successor, Vivian <a href=\"/biographies/fuchs_sir\">FUCHS</a>, on the latter's introductory tour of the Dependencies at the end of 1947 and in early part of 1948. Fuchs wrote of him: 'He was a sturdy active man, who always found something that needed doing and then did it. His equable temperament admirably suited our rather strange conditions. Purposeful, sensible, helpful; never did he overplay his hand'.</p><p>Such a man also found the Falkland Islands much to his liking, and in 1948 he returned once more, as senior medical officer to the government of the Falkland Islands and Dependencies. He warmly supported Governor <a href=\"/biographies/clifford_sir\">CLIFFORD</a>'s acquisition and use of aircraft for medical purposes, and he enterprisingly used his Kiel connections to recruit German camp-dentists at a time of shortage in Britain. As SMO, Slessor was responsible for the King Edward VII Memorial Hospital, and for its medical staff. His many years of public service as deputy governor, member of the ExCo and LegCo, and of Stanley Town Council, were recognised in the award of the Coronation Medal in 1952 and the OBE in 1957. He is remembered as a caring doctor and a good administrator, a good host, and the man who cut quite a dash in his Rolls Royce motor car. Governor <a href=\"/biographies/haskard_cosmo\">HASKARD</a> recalled that Slessor 'knew just about everyone, but was strictly professional in keeping his own counsel, a man regarded with respect and affection'.</p><p>On 7 September 1951, in Dublin, Slessor married Sheila Margaret Brough, a nurse whom he had known at the Rotunda. They had no children and she died on 10 May, 1956. Despite this loss, he remained in the Islands until he retired on 31 May 1968 and was given the kind of ceremonial send off aboard RMS <em>Darwin </em>which is normally accorded only to departing governors.</p><p>He made a new home in Javea, Spain, where he was a keen gardener, an enthusiastic walker, and an exceptional host. He died on 8 July 1985, after walking in the Cairngorms, and was cremated in Aberdeen. His ashes were interred in Port Stanley cemetery, alongside those of his wife.</p><p><a href=\"/biographies/arrowsmith_sir\">See Image 12</a></p>",

        "body": "<p>FIC colonial manager, was born in East Wemyss, Fife, Scotland on 28 October 1928, the only child of James Sloggie and Agnes Sloggie, née Smith. He was educated at Dumfries Academy, gaining his Scottish Highers in 1946. After a short period with the Clydesdale Bank he was conscripted into the Kings Own Scottish Borderers and later the Royal Engineers serving as a cartographer in the Middle East for most of his two years service. Back in civvy street, again with the Clydesdale Bank, and dissatisfied with career prospects, he applied for and gained a post with the Standard Bank of South Africa, working in London before being transferred to Nairobi, Kenya in December 1951, where he was put in charge of a department. Postings to Dar es Salaam, Lindi and Mtwara in Southern Tanganyika followed: where he thoroughly enjoyed life, sailing, swimming and fishing in the wonderful waters of the East African Coast. In 1955 he was again posted to Nairobi where he met and married Noeline, elder daughter of Noel <a href=\"/biographies/biggs_bernard\">BIGGS</a>, late of the Falkland Islands. They had two daughters, Allison (b1956) and Fiona (b1959). In 1957 he joined Kenya Co-operative Creameries as accountant and in 1962 was transferred to Uganda Creameries in Kampala, Uganda. With life becoming increasingly difficult after independence, he noticed an advertisement in the East African Standard. The Falklands Islands Company was looking for an assistant manager in Stanley. Frank <a href=\"/biographies/mitchell_francis\">MITCHELL</a> of London Office flew to Entebbe for the interview resulting in the family leaving East Africa in 1964.</p><p>Passage to the Falkland Islands was on board RMS <em>Arlanza </em>to Montevideo and onward by RMS <em>Darwin </em>to Stanley. The family arrived together with the new governor Cosmo <a href=\"/biographies/haskard_cosmo\">HASKARD</a> and his wife. Captain White, Master of the <em>Darwin </em>told Sloggie that the large welcoming crowd for the new governor were mostly Noeline's relatives curious to see the man she was bringing home! Quickly settling into the Falklands he enjoyed the varied life, learning how the FIC worked and meeting farmers and the local people, and sorting out the relationships! His first four year tour saw many changes and one or two excitements. Always a keen rifle shot, he joined the Falkland Islands Rifle Association and during his leaves in 1968 and 1974 formed part of the Islands team at Bisley.</p><p>Whilst on leave in 1968 he was offered the position of colonial manager in Stanley. He accepted, and held the post for the next six years. He and his family moved into Stanley House which had been the residence of all colonial managers since it was built in 1870 and provided a wonderful setting for the hospitality and entertaining that the job required. During these years the Islands and the Company were in a state of flux. The British Government was encouraging Argentina to take an active interest in the Islands resulting in visits from many 'experts', politicians and journalists from both the United Kingdom and Argentina. The FIC steamer was withdrawn. The Argentines were invited to provide a temporary airstrip and air connection to take her place. Sloggie was appointed to ExCo by Governor <a href=\"/biographies/lewis_ernest\">LEWIS</a>. He was very involved in the various negotiations, always with the real interests of the Falkland Islands much in mind and not happy about the way things were going.</p><p>In 1974 the Company decided to abolish the position of colonial manager and to close Stanley House. After much heart-searching Sloggie decided not to return to the Islands at the end of his leave. He joined the National Farmers Union as a group secretary, firstly in Yorkshire and then in Suffolk where he remained until he retired. He loved the work and soon gained the friendship and respect of everyone he met. He retired in 1993 and enjoyed eight very active years wood-turning, sailing and travelling, before succumbing to cancer. He died in Bury St Edmunds on 28 June 2002.</p>",

His first ship was the <em>Courageux </em>, which he joined in May 1810.</p><p>In 1832 Smith was first officer on the <em>Tyne </em>, Captain <a href=\"/biographies/hope_charles\">HOPE</a>, when she visited the Islands and on her return from Peru he volunteered to become British resident at Port Louis. Without instructions and with only a boat's crew of four sailors, he was taken from Río de Janeiro to the Islands aboard the survey ship <em>Challenger </em>. He landed on 9 January 1834 and hoisted the flag the next day to a 21 gun salute from the <em>Challenger </em>. He found a dismal scene: <a href=\"/biographies/rivero_antonio\">RIVERO</a> and the gauchos had murdered <a href=\"/biographies/vernet_louis\">VERNET</a>'s senior colonists and the survivors had taken refuge on an island in Berkeley Sound. On 12 January Smith set out with a posse of marines and officers from the <em>Challenger </em>, but despite a long and difficult search found none of the offenders. A second search, helped by six marines left by <em>Challenger </em>, captured the four remaining gauchos who were shipped to England.</p><p>Smith proved an energetic and capable administrator who was prepared to use his own funds to promote development. 'I am in fact with regard to the few inhabitants, everything', he told Admiral Hamond, commanding the South American station. 'I have to supply them with all the necessities of life from a reel of pins to a poncho'. He did however expect to be allowed to seal on the Islands and a dispute arose with the Admiral who refused to allow Smith to ship his sealskins on a naval vessel and forbade him to engage in trade. Smith protested:</p><blockquote><blockquote>I am too poor and have too large a family to throw my time and money away in recovering the property of another [ie Vernet] and I have no other way of remunerating myself than taking a proportion of seal-skins. After 25 years I have only a Lieutenant's commission, a few honourable scars and I hope an untarnished name.</blockquote></blockquote><p>He was also outraged to find that the British consul in Río had granted the captain of the <em>Susannah Ann </em>permission to seal on the Falklands - in protest Smith tendered his resignation, without effect.</p><p>When Admiral Grey visited in 1836, he was impressed by the progress of the settlement. Smith had collected a small gaucho posse and there were 200 tame cattle with calves on the hills around Port Louis. The settlers were generally contented. Smith was in touch with Vernet who was trying to recover his property, which included the horses essential to the life of the colony. In 1835, being forbidden to engage in trade, Smith appointed his son Hugh as Vernet's agent, but the latter never recovered his property during Smith's time, and indeed precious little thereafter.</p><p>On 6 April 1838, Lt <a href=\"/biographies/lowcay_robert\">LOWCAY</a> took over as resident and Smith returned to London. He sought compensation from the Colonial Office and wrote to the Secretary of State, Lord John Russell, detailing his expenditure and achievements. He was denied a meeting with the junior minister and coldly told to apply to the Admiralty for help. It was poor recognition for one who, in his own words: 'found it [East Falkland] a waste and a wilderness, recent scene of a horrid massacre. Instead of making or avoiding difficulties, I hope I did as became me, I surmounted those I met. Ambition had some share in it, but the good of my country was the mainspring...'</p><p>In December 1844 Smith was appointed in command of the sloop <em>Rattler </em>, which the following year was fitted with a screw propeller and took part in a series of trials against the paddle-sloop <em>Alecto </em>, to determine the most effective method of propulsion. These culminated in a tug of war in which the <em>Rattler  </em>clearly triumphed. Smith was promoted captain in 1846. In 1853 he was appointed in command of the iron screw ship <em>Simoon </em>for service in the Black Sea - the Crimean War was about to break out. Smith was commended for his zeal and activity, but died on board his ship at anchor in Varna Bay (Bulgaria) on 19 August 1854 - probably from cholera.</p><p>Smith married Eliza on 19 October 1832, but he had probably been married before, as his son Hugh was at least a teen-ager when he joined Smith at Port Louis in the mid-1830s.</p>",

Governor <a href=\"/biographies/kerr_thomas\">KERR</a> describes him, with irritation, as:</p><blockquote><blockquote>a mischievous agitator, who has obtained an ascendancy amongst some of his fellow carpenters and a few of the labourers in Stanley by persuading them that they have grievances which might be redressed by a combination for that purpose. The well-disposed and peaceable inhabitants of the settlement look upon the movement with distrust and dislike...</blockquote></blockquote><p>The Reform Club launched a number of petitions to the Governor and to the Secretary of State, who were both unsympathetic. Among other points, the Club asked for representation in LegCo.</p><p>Smith was prominent among the lists of petitioners for many years and was a stone in the shoe of government. He dropped the name of an Irish MP, Swift MacNeill, with whom he was in contact and in 1890 the latter asked a question in parliament, taken up by the <em>Belfast Telegraph </em>, critical of governor Kerr. Indignantly, Kerr denounced Smith in LegCo on 10 May 1890:</p><blockquote><blockquote>how a mean obscure, illiterate and despicable individual may in his craving for notoriety and in his ignorant and misdirected malice become the cause of infinite trouble and annoyance to innocent and honourable persons...</blockquote></blockquote><p>When the Volunteers were formed in the 1890s Smith became a second lieutenant.</p><p>Smith died on 23 December 1917 of heart failure and senile decay; his wife died the following year. Both are buried in Stanley cemetery. Smith was the first of a series of humbler colonists agitating with little success for a fairer share in government.</p>",

        "body": " <p>sealer and writer, appears to have been born in Lewisham, near London, about 1801. The early death of his father and problems with his widowed mother's family resulted in his running away and adoption by a band of gypsies. Next, as a ships' boy, he went to sea and remained a sailor for the rest of his life. His vessel became involved in the Napoleonic Wars and, after being captured and recaptured, he ended up aboard  <em>Hindoustan </em>with the Royal Navy in which he describes much action during the Peninsular War (1812-1815). But he deserted in Portsmouth, went to London, and joined  <em>Norfolk </em>on a sealing voyage to South Georgia in 1815.</p><p>At the beginning of this voyage he wrote:</p><blockquote><blockquote>Until now, I, and many of the boys had been in total ignorance with regard to the ship's port of destination or the nature of her voyage. Some of us had still cherished the idea that the ship was bound to the coast of Africa, and this was strengthened by listening to the frequent conversation which the men held about killing huge elephants with lances and shooting them.</blockquote></blockquote><p>On arrival at South Georgia he describes many bays and anchorages several of which may be identified from Captain <a href=\"/biographies/cook_james\">COOK</a>'s place-names, but a few are difficult to determine. His account of the island is good and includes descriptions of the glaciers, mountainous terrain, and severe weather.</p><p>Details of the Elephant Seal industry are excellent, especially the calendar, which begins after winter with the 'Pupping-Cow Season' in October, the 'Brown-Cow Season' follows, then the 'Young-Bull Season', and the 'March Bull Season'. Smith notes 'the season for seal commences in December and lasts through the three winter [sic] months'. Construction of shallops and the difficulties of their deployment in smaller bays and transport of blubber to the ship are described.  <em>Norfolk </em>wintered in South Georgia for 1816. At last a full cargo was obtained and  <em>Norfolk </em>departed for London in December 1816 with 3500 barrels of Elephant Seal oil and 5000 Fur Seal skins. Smith commented: 'I suffered much with the severity of the cold, which affected my feet to a great degree. I had neither shoes nor stockings having previously worn them out'.</p><p> <em>Admiral Colpoys </em>was his next sealer, aboard which Smith began a voyage to South Georgia in May 1817 as an apprentice, but was wrecked there in November, with almost a full cargo of Elephant Seal oil aboard. He, and the rest of the crew were taken back to London by a ship belonging to the same owners in early 1818.</p><p>After a refit  <em>Norfolk </em>, accompanied by a schooner <em>Ann </em>, sailed again in June 1818 with Smith aboard as a seaman. The events of this voyage involved his survival from the wreck of a sloop, probably at Cooper Bay in South Georgia. Sealing has become, by this time, less profitable in South Georgia, so an exploratory voyage to the South Sandwich Islands was made in the 1818-19 summer. Smith's description is brief, but notes one of the volcanic peaks - 'one of nature's lighthouses, planted in the midst of a distant ocean by that unseen hand, to serve as a beacon to the fearless mariner'. No seals were found so the islands were of no interest to the captain and after three days  <em>Norfolk </em>returned to South Georgia. Here a replacement shallop was purchased and Smith was aboard her working in the Bay of Islands when he suffered another wreck 'which so affected the Captain that he was near to putting an end to his existence'. Smith then spent the 1819 winter on South Georgia. Bad luck continued for, after an unsuccessful voyage, he was back in London to find the ship and cargo in the hands of creditors. Circumstances were such that he wrote: 'I was under the necessity of pledging my clothes from time to time to procure food'.</p><p>Despite these unfortunate vicissitudes Smith was now an experienced Antarctic sealer and went aboard  <em>Hetty </em>accompanied by  <em>Sprightly </em>. In 1819 the South Shetland Islands had been discovered and a major 'seal rush' began as they abounded with highly profitable Fur Seals. The vessels first visited the Falkland Islands for a fortnight to take water and shoot geese, pigs, and cattle. Smith commented: 'These islands are worthy of cultivation, as they possess good, rich, and extensive tracts of land'.</p><p>On arrival at the South Shetland Islands problems of finding suitable landings and opposition from other sealing gangs arose. Nevertheless their efforts were 'crowned with abundant success, by the discovery of several beaches along the coast, which were thronged with these animals [Fur Seals] in every direction'. Smith's account describes conflicts between different sealing gangs, with British and American sealers fighting at Robbery Beaches on Livingston Island. His near drowning and the effects of seal bites did not dampen his enthusiasm for this voyage which obtained a full cargo and should have been very profitable. Sadly on return to London in 1821, he found the seal pelt market glutted and, for himself and the crew <em> </em>'the amount of their wages reduced to a mere trifle'.</p><p>That was the last of his sealing voyages but he then joined the somewhat similar whaling trade working first in the Pacific Ocean, becoming involved in the wars of independence of Chile and Peru. His first voyage was very profitable, but he was relieved of his earnings by a thief in London. Subsequent voyages were to New Zealand, just in time to become involved with the Maori Wars of which he gives good descriptions. More whaling voyages took him to many Pacific islands and the coasts of Africa from where he 'washed up' in the Massachusetts whaling port of New Bedford, after a serious chest injury from being crushed by an oil barrel.</p><p>Weakened by these events, Smith took employment ashore. After two years in New Bedford he attended lectures by a preacher 'which labor eventually resulted in the conversion of my heart to God.' Thus he came to join the Christian Labor Academy but, for financial reasons, was unable to continue there. His autobiography ends around 1838, reporting increasing debility, probably tuberculosis. This book has a very long title:</p><p> <em>A Narrative of the Life Travels and Sufferings of Thomas W. Smith comprising an account of his Early Life, Adoption by the Gipsys; his Travels During Eighteen Voyages to various parts of the World, During which he was five time Shipwrecked; thrice on a Desolate Island near the South Pole, once on the coast of England and once on the coast of Africa. He took part in several Battles on the coast of Spain and Peru and witnessed several others; was once taken by Pirates, from whom he was Providentially Delivered and placed in a small boat and set adrift at a great distance from land, without the means for conducting her to the shore, he afterwards took part in Four Minor Engagements with Savages near New Guinea </em>.</p><p>It was published in Boston, Mass, in 1844, probably posthumously. His origin and early life are described but there are discrepancies: some perhaps from failings of memory, but after a highly adventurous life, Smith may have had other reasons for not being entirely open. His adventures tally well with historical facts. Thomas W Smith was one of the very few literate 'below decks' men from the sealing period of Antarctic history. His fascinating autobiography is one of the earliest accounts of the Dependencies of the Falkland Islands and a very good source for the sealing industry.</p>",

        "body": "<p>American sea captain and consul, was born in Providence, Rhode Island. James W Smyley, a ship's master who visited the Falklands in the 1840s may have been a brother. WH Smyley's letters, with their eccentric spelling and grammar (which have been generally corrected in this essay), suggest that he had little formal schooling. He must first have come to the south Atlantic in the crew of a sealing or whaling ship during the 1820s - in 1850 he wrote that he had spent 22 years of his life 'mostly from South Shetlands to the River La Plata'.</p><p><strong>Smyley and Vernet</strong></p><p>In December 1829 the  <em>Bellville  </em>from Massachusetts arrived in the Islands. Louis <a href=\"/biographies/vernet_louis\">VERNET</a> chartered the ship for cargo work, but she was wrecked on Tierra del Fuego, and the crew made their way back to the Falklands in a small shallop constructed from the wreck's timbers, arriving on 30 May. A group of men from the  <em>Bellville, </em>with Smyley among them, were wandering around the Falklands, presumably sealing, and Vernet arrested them briefly before taking them into his service. (The US minister in Buenos Aires, Francis Baylies, mentioned Smyley among those arrested when he protested to the Argentines.) Smyley and others signed an agreement to work for Vernet building a shallop on Eagle Island. This vessel, the  <em>Aguila </em>, or  <em>Eagle </em>, was captured by Captain <a href=\"/biographies/lynch_william\">LYNCH</a> of the USS  <em>Lexington </em>when he approached Port Louis in December 1831.</p><p>In November 1831, just before the destruction of Port Louis by the  <em>Lexington </em>, Vernet issued Smyley with a document commissioning him as branch pilot for Port Louis, Port William, Choiseul Bay and 'for other ports, bays and waters under my jurisdiction'. A document which makes no reference to the Argentine government which had appointed Vernet  <em>commandante </em>of Port Louis, but one which confirms that Smyley was already an experienced navigator in Falklands waters.</p><p><strong>Sealing and Antarctica</strong></p><p>Smyley's first voyage as ship's master was in the schooner  <em>Sailor's Return </em>which left Newport, RI, on 3 July 1836 and made good time southwards by keeping close into the corner of Brazil (rather than sailing across to the coast of Africa and then back). Smyley hunted seals in the Falkland Islands and the South Shetlands. A second voyage in 1837 ended with the  <em>Sailor's Return </em>wrecked on a reef off the coast of Brazil. In April 1839 he sailed south again as master and part owner of the schooner  <em>Benjamin de Wolf  </em>and reached Port Egmont in only 41 days. After sealing in the Islands and again on the coast of Patagonia, Smyley returned with 1,375 fur seal skins and 150 hair seal skins - not an enormous haul. In 1840-41 he made a repeat voyage in the  <em>Benjamin de Wolf </em>. On both voyages, the British naval officers in charge at Port Louis reported Smyley's presence with concern.</p><p>His next voyage in the 125 ton schooner  <em>Ohio </em>proved to have some scientific significance. Smyley left Newport on 14 July 1841, sailed down to Staten Island {Isla de los Estados} and then across to the South Shetlands. On Deception Island in February 1842, Smyley recovered the maximum and minimum temperature thermometers left by HMS  <em>Chanticleer </em>(Captain Henry Foster) in 1829. When Smyley picked up the maximum thermometer, the indicator slipped making the reading unreliable. But the minimum one produced a reading of -5 degrees Fahrenheit, and until 1895 this was the lowest temperature recorded in Antarctica.</p><p>As Smyley left Deception, the Island erupted: 'the South Side of the Isle was all on fire, there being 13 volcanoes and many other places where you might pick up Sinders [sic], the water was boiling hot in many places in the harbour'. His description of the event was borne out by accounts of an eruption in 1969, when twenty vents erupted along a great fissure five miles long.</p><p>On leaving Deception, it appears that Smyley sailed south-west, possibly as far as 66 degrees south sailing through the Pendleton Strait to reach Cape Horn. His sealing cannot have prospered as he picked up a return cargo of coffee in Brazil, reaching New York in July 1842.</p><p>In September 1842, Smyley set off once more in the  <em>Ohio </em>, accompanied by the  <em>Sarah Ann </em>, a 60 ton schooner. He was part owner of both vessels. He sealed off the Río Negro in Patagonia and reported that despite keeping careful watch in the long summer days he had seen no sign of La Agle Shoal. But the  <em>Ohio </em>was wrecked on the coast of Río Negro on 27 March 1843, 'with bare time to save my crew and only succeeded in doing so by taking part of them on the spars of the vessel nine miles,' wrote Smyley later. Later that year Smyley shipped supplies from Río to the garrison in the Falklands on the  <em>Sarah Ann </em>.</p><p><strong>A bold adventurous man...</strong></p><p>The establishment of British rule in 1833 and the arrival of a lieutenant-governor in 1842, should have restricted his sealing around the Islands. But unless a naval vessel was present in Falklands waters, Smyley was free to act as he pleased. His reputation certainly alarmed Governor <a href=\"/biographies/moody_richard\">MOODY</a>, who wrote to the British admiral at Río de Janeiro in October 1845, that Smyley was 'a bold adventurous man of high courage and little enough of principle'. Moody noted that Capt Grey in HMS  <em>Cleopatra </em>had tried to capture Smyley, who had robbed the Isla de Lobos near Montevideo. It was possible Smyley would try to capture the colonial chest at Stanley.</p><p>The classic description of Smyley's methods comes in a letter to the Secretary of State, WE Gladstone, of 10 July 1846 from the magistrate WH <a href=\"/biographies/moore_william\">MOORE</a> (who was embroiled in a commercial dispute with Smyley): he alleged that Smyley had intimidated the governor; that he had defied Royal Navy captains; that he had sealed illegally on the Isla de Lobos; and that he had donned British uniform to hoodwink an American sealer into handing over his catch. But Governor Moody had already had a private talk with Smyley in June 1846. The latter had:</p><blockquote><blockquote>Deposited with me...a great number of papers and singular documents giving me a curious insight into his past and present proceedings in these seas. These documents ...remove much of the bad impression I confess I entertained towards this individual and strengthened my opinion of his activity, skill, courage and enterprise.</blockquote></blockquote><p>This did not prevent Moody from writing sharply to Smyley on 8 June, requesting him to close the gunports and unload the two guns on his ship  <em>Catherine </em>as they were causing 'uneasiness to many'.</p><p>Smyley had continued shipping supplies from Río Negro on the Coast to the infant colony, using first his schooner  <em>Sarah Ann </em>(60 tons), then the  <em>Catherine </em>(74 tons) and finally the barque  <em>Christiana  </em>(252 tons), which he had bought in Stanley.</p><p><strong>Marriage</strong></p><p>On 29 March 1839, Smyley married Evelina J Chafee, daughter of Otis Chafee in New York. She died on 23 June 1847 and is buried in Island Cemetery, Newport. His second wife, Catherine Clapp, accompanied Smyley when he settled in Stanley. They had two daughters there: Evelina Jane (b1852) and Catherine Rebecca (b1858). A son, William Horton Smyley, was baptised in Stanley in 1859, but presumably born in the United States during the family's absence from the Falklands between 1854 and 1856. Smyley rented Seal Island from government in 1857 and at his death owned two half acre sites in Stanley.</p><p><strong>Consul and Commercial Agent</strong></p><p>In February 1851, Governor <a href=\"/biographies/rennie_george\">RENNIE</a> reported that Smyley entered his office wearing diplomatic uniform to announce that he was the Commercial Agent of the US Government. He had indeed been appointed by the US Secretary of State Daniel Webster on 12 September 1850 during his visit to the States. He was also appointed US Consul at Río Negro in Argentine Patagonia, but noted that the dictator of Argentina, General <a href=\"/biographies/rosas_juan\">ROSAS</a>, did not wish to accept consuls outside the capital, Buenos Aires. Smyley was always conscious that his post was an expense to his government: 'it is all out go and no in come'. He received a salary of $500 a quarter which he seldom drew as American Bills of Exchange were rarely accepted in Stanley.</p><p>Smyley reported shipping movements, shipwrecks and import figures to Washington, while his deputies, first JB <a href=\"/biographies/whitington_john\">WHITINGTON</a> and then JM <a href=\"/biographies/dean_john1\">DEAN</a>, both leading figures in the colony, corrected his spelling and brushed up his prose style. Fortunately they did not blunt his vigorous style, usually directed at the colonial government or, as he described it in 1854: 'the despotic power which here exists'. As for Governor Rennie: 'that despotic governor ... seemed to throw every obstacle in my way', while his son who served as a magistrate 'has not common sense and not as much brain as a cabbage'.</p><p><strong>The Germantown Incident</strong></p><p>Three years after his appointment, early in 1854, Smyley was to confront Governor Rennie in a series of incidents resulting from the governor's determination to make American ships' captains subject to the colony's laws. In February HMS  <em>Express </em>was sent to arrest two American whalers for killing wild cattle in West Falklands. Smyley, who had been warned by the governor on 23 January that he intended to take the American ships at New Island to task, had summoned the USS  <em>Germantown </em>, a powerful frigate with a fiery captain, NF <a href=\"/biographies/lynch_william\">LYNCH</a>, from Montevideo. Shortly after Lynch's arrival, the whalers  <em>Hudson </em>and  <em>Washington </em>were shepherded into Stanley harbour by HMS  <em>Express </em>. Smyley took Lynch to call on the governor and a heated exchange followed. Lynch loaded his guns and trained them on the courtroom; the American whaling captains escaped with light fines.</p><p>Smyley was closely involved with a second dispute in 1854. An American, Captain Bernsee, had lost his ship the  <em>Courier </em>wrecked near Bull Point in Lafonia on 1 April. To pay his crew, he sold the wreck and contents at auction and was then arrested for breach of the auctioneer's ordinance. Smyley had been present at the illegal sale (though he did not report this to Washington) and had advised Bernsee that he might have problems. Bernsee was released after two and a half months mild confinement (Smyley dined with him many nights - champagne was sent in) and sailed for Montevideo on 17 August. On 23 August, Captain Lynch paid a second visit to Stanley to enquire into the Bernsee case. He exchanged ill-tempered letters with the governor, who declined to see him; again threatened to bombard the settlement; and finding Bernsee already released, left after three days.</p><p>Smyley had left with the crew of the  <em>Courier </em>for Montevideo in June. His relations with Rennie were at breaking point. The governor 'has shown his inveterate hatred to me and all my countrymen' wrote Smyley. Since the  <em>Germantown  </em>had left in March, Smyley felt he had been 'like a target to be shot at'. He resented American sailors being fined for killing animals which their predecessors, not the British government, had placed on islands. He challenged British authority outside the town of Stanley and assured the magistrate, <a href=\"/biographies/montagu_algernon\">MONTAGU</a>, that the American flag would soon wave over West Falkland. For his part, Rennie believed that the accredited agent of the United States was abetting the lawless acts of his countrymen.</p><p>From Montevideo, Smyley left for home later in 1854, having decided that it was not worth returning to the Islands while Rennie was governor. In October 1856 he returned to Stanley: 'my reception was very flattering and everyone in the colony gave me such a hearty welcome'. The new governor, TEL <a href=\"/biographies/moore_david\">MOORE</a>, was a naval captain, as was his successor <a href=\"/biographies/mackenzie_james\">MACKENZIE</a>. It was understandable that they got on better with Smyley than Rennie had. But increasingly, Smyley's major service to his country and to the whole south Atlantic region became the rescue of shipwrecked sailors from the shores of the Falklands, Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego.</p><p><strong>The Work of Rescue</strong></p><p>In October 1851, as the captain who knew these shores best, Smyley was approached by Samuel <a href=\"/biographies/lafone_samuel\">LAFONE</a> in Montevideo to find and assist the Patagonian Missionary Society (PMS) party led by Captain Allen <a href=\"/biographies/gardiner_allen1\">GARDINER</a>, which had been landed by the Beagle Channel in 1850. In foul weather Smyley sailed around Staten Island, first discovering the shipwrecked crew of a Danish ship, the  <em>Alladen </em>. Then, in Spaniard's Harbour on the north shore of the Beagle Channel, he found the possessions and bodies of three of the seven missionaries. But before he could investigate further, he was forced to put to sea by a sudden change in the wind and had to sail north to leave the Danes on the coast of Patagonia and to re-provision at Montevideo. Returning south he recruited fresh crew at the Falklands and set off again for Tierra del Fuego. But on the second trip the weather was no better and he could find no trace of the party.</p><p>Smyley undertook a succession of cruises along the coasts of South America and the Falkland Islands. In 1857 he rescued the crew of the American ship  <em>Great Republic </em>and helped to bring her safely into Stanley Harbour (where he complained prices were extortionate). In 1858 he rescued the sole survivor of the Belgian ship  <em>Leopold </em>from the Jason Islands; he was to receive a telescope from the King of the Belgians in thanks. In 1859, when the  <em>Dolphin </em>was shipwrecked on the Coast of Patagonia, he observed that if the crew should fall into Indian hands:</p><blockquote><blockquote>I may have much trouble to ransom them... as for the character of these Indians perhaps I know them better than any man living - and the better you know them the more you dread them. I have been their guest at one time and their prisoner at another.</blockquote></blockquote><p>His most well known exploit was the rescue of the sole survivor of the PMS party on board the  <em>Allen Gardiner </em>. In March 1860 Smyley sailed to Tierra del Fuego in search of the  <em>Allen Gardiner </em>. He found the ship at anchor, deserted and later he discovered the cook, Alfred Coles, who alone had survived the attack of the Fuegians. It had been a hectic mission - 'I did not even take off my clothes from the day I left until I returned' - but it won him great acclaim. The Royal Humane Society awarded him a medal; the Patagonian Missionary Society presented him with a Bible.</p><p>Reporting his 1851-2 rescue attempts to Washington, Smyley complained of the expense, but added:</p><blockquote><blockquote>...as there is no other person here who owns or keeps a vessel, it falls very hard on me but yet how can I refuse. It is not alone for our countrymen but for all nations and often my will is better than my means &amp; in the next place we have so little communication with any place. It may be considered we are almost out of the world.</blockquote></blockquote><p>Smyley's relations with the manager of the FIC, Thomas <a href=\"/biographies/havers_thomas\">HAVERS</a>, a commercial rival, were unhappy. In 1857 Havers reported to his head office in London that Smyley had been stealing cattle in Lafonia and on Saunders Island. Smyley had carried off one prospective witness, but was eventually brought to trial and convicted of killing one bullock and fined £2. Havers continued:</p><blockquote><blockquote>This man has an expensive vessel here kept for no ostensible use, he comes and goes as he pleases and no-one cares to ask him how he earns his living. He and I are on quite good terms notwithstanding the trial and yet I know him to be little better than a pirate, being well acquainted with some extensive robberies he has committed ...The people here are all more or less afraid of Smyley and it is not easy to induce anyone to speak out ...</blockquote></blockquote><p><strong>Last Years: 'one of our best consuls.'</strong></p><p>In March 1861 he told the State Department that he wished to place his children in a school in America ('we are in a den of corruption' in Stanley) and warned that 'my health has been very poor of late'. His doctors had told him to leave the Islands and get some rest. But that same month the British admiral visiting Stanley greeted him warmly and was delighted when Smyley offered to pilot HMS  <em>Ardent </em>to New Island. He was granted six months leave the following year but by then the American Civil War had broken out, with the real risk of conflict with Britain. He could not leave his post: 'I keep my vessel well manned and with three months provision aboard ready to slip from her moorings and proceed off Cape Horn to notify all our vessels'. He sent his wife and children home and noted that the government 'treat me with every respect, but at the same time they watch me like a cat would a mouse'. In February 1864 he reached Montevideo, but returned to Stanley to help an American ship laden with arms for San Francisco, which was leaking. Finally he sailed north again, leaving Montevideo for the States in June 1864 in his ship the  <em>Kate Sargent.  </em>At the end of 1865 he wrote that he had been received 'with great civility in the Treasury and the State Department and on my arrival in New York I received a most flattering reception from the New York underwriters'. He asked for a small steam launch which he could carry south on his ship for use in rescue work, but nothing came of this.</p><p>In April 1866 he was back in Stanley, and in August he proposed to sail to Río Negro as the town was likely to come under attack from Indians and was poorly defended. There is no sign that he went. On 2 March 1868, JM Dean reported to Washington that Smyley had died of cholera in Montevideo on 13 February. The FIC manager FE <a href=\"/biographies/cobb_frederick\">COBB</a> noted:</p><blockquote><blockquote>The  <em>Guerri </em>è <em>re </em>has brought news of the death of Captain Smyley of cholera in Montevideo, just as he was about to return to the Islands. Much regret has been expressed here at this event and all flags, government ones included, have been flying half mast high as a token of respect. Captain Smyley was for many years a strong and inveterate enemy of the company and Mr Lane, but to me personally he had always shown a friendly feeling and more than one act of kindness and civility on his part have caused me to join in the general regret for his loss.</blockquote></blockquote><p>A US admiral, Davis, came south to arrange Smyley's affairs and A <a href=\"/biographies/bailey_arthur\">BAILEY</a> and JM Dean were his executors. He owned two houses in Stanley and two schooners. His wife had remained at his home in Flushing, NY, since early in the Civil War.</p><p>In 1863 a State Department official had noted on one of his despatches: 'he is one of our best consuls, though as you will see he has not had a college education. He keeps a schooner employed in looking for shipwrecked seamen in the Straits...'</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Smyley is one of the most remarkable characters of the early days of the colony and indeed in the history of Patagonia and Antarctica. Apart from his despatches to Washington and his official correspondence with Falklands governors, little that he wrote has survived - but then he was a man of action, not words. He lives in the impression he made on others, as a bold and skilful mariner, who moved from youthful escapades to mature philanthropy and eventually near-respectability. He deserves to be better known, both in the countries of the south Atlantic and in his native land. He is remembered by Smylie's Channel in West Falkland and Smylie's Creek in East Falkland</p>",

        "body": " <p>mariner, explorer and writer, was born at Poole, Dorset on 27 November 1817. His father, a naval officer who had served at Trafalgar died in 1826 and his mother, née Barker, took the family abroad, leaving William behind at the Royal Hospital School, Greenwich. At 13 he was apprenticed to a merchant brig bound for Calcutta and experienced the worst excesses of cruelty and discipline at sea. He had an unsuccessful period working in Australia and returned to England in 1836. Snow joined the Royal Navy, found it not to his liking, was a troublesome seaman and was eventually discharged (apparently after jumping overboard to rescue a colleague from a shark) after a year's service off Africa. On his return to England he married and embarked on unsuccessful ventures such as running a hotel in Australia and a club in Italy. He augmented meagre earnings by writing for the papers and acting as clerk and translator.</p><p>After a year in America where he became transfixed by the fate of the Franklin Expedition, Snow returned to England in 1850 and persuaded Lady Franklin to appoint him as purser, doctor and chief officer on the <em>Prince Albert  </em>in one of many unsuccessful searches for Franklin. Snow did not get on well with his fellow officers, but wrote the official, well received, account and for years afterwards badgered the Admiralty to send him on further expeditions in search of Franklin.</p><p>Captain Allen <a href=\"/biographies/gardiner_allen1\">GARDINER</a>, the visionary behind the Patagonian Missionary Society, had planned to establish a mission station on one of the Falkland Islands and purchase a vessel to traverse between there and the coast of Patagonia. The Society eventually was granted a lease on Keppel Island and the 86 ton schooner <em>Allen Gardiner </em>sailed from Bristol in 1854 with Snow in command arriving at Keppel in January 1855.</p><p>Snow's journals give a valuable early account of the vegetation of the Falklands before the introduction of grazing stock. The beaches along the north-east coast of Keppel are described a 'being fringed with Tussac, Fachinal and Balsam Bog' and the flat area between Cove Hill and Robinson's Point was covered with 'plentiful Tussac'. On the afternoon of 5 February, the day of the 'official' landing ceremony, Snow allowed the crew and settlers a general holiday. Three of the men wandered up through the main valley on the Island and, despite Snow's repeated earlier warnings, one of them, John Watts, threw a lighted paper on the ground and started a small fire, which quickly spread out of control in the dry grass. The fire continued to spread for several days, particularly all round the slopes of Cove Hill. Eventually it threatened the construction of the small settlement and Snow and his party were forced to move across to the other side of the creek. Snow described his view of the fire just before they made the decision to move the settlement:</p><blockquote><blockquote>before us, the whole valley was one awful mass of flame, all burning bushes with thousands of little dancing fires, were coming with remarkable rapidity towards us ... scores of the globular bog-balsams were glowing with livid fire, while the fachinal and other shrubs crackled in the flames.</blockquote></blockquote><p>During all this, more alarming thoughts were going through Snow's mind concerning the impending disaster that might befall the whole venture, and indeed the whole Society! He recounts:</p><blockquote><blockquote>I knew the state of funds at home, I knew that all was with us ... were our present supply; or even the timber, to be consumed by this terrible conflagration, there would then be an entire stop to the work. Dispirited at hearing nothing but disasters [a reference to Gardiner and his companion's death by starvation off Tierra del Fuego, 3 years earlier], the public would not come forward to assist any more.</blockquote></blockquote><p>Snow and his party dug a firebreak across the narrow isthmus to isolate the piece of land they were on, from the rest of the island and hence the fire.</p><p>The following week was spent building a six-roomed house planned as a temporary dwelling, so care was taken to avoid using timber intended for the permanent house. In the event, the party stayed in the house for almost nine months before moving to the site of the permanent station (the present settlement).</p><p>The fire took almost five weeks to burn out and only one or two parts of the Island escaped. Watts was eventually taken to Stanley, tried and found guilty of arson. Although he was fined the statutory £20, Snow's appeal on his behalf had the sum reduced.</p><p>Snows' journals are of considerable historical value as they contain detailed accounts of the establishment of the mission, his journeys to neighbouring islands, the natural history, and the town of Stanley. In relation to apportioning blame for the fire, once the temporary dwelling was established, Snow took great pains to hand over authority of the station to the doctor and superintendent, Ellis and his 'land party', and from then on regarded them as distinct from his 'ship's party'.</p><p>This enabled Snow to write to the Governor on 13 July (from Saunders Island):</p><blockquote><blockquote>As to the destruction by fire of the Tussac and boxwood on Keppel Island I must inform you that neither myself or ships crew, or any person under <em>my </em>authority, have done aught, directly or indirectly to injure any of the land, or material, or prohibited articles on Keppel ... and in relation to the fire (not caused by any of the party under my own immediate control) I will immediately communicate with Mr Ellis, the superintendent of the land party who will no doubt, give you full information on the subject .... As <em>Allen Gardiner </em>, her crew and myself are entirely distinct ... and separate from the land party, in regards to the duties of the missing station .... I shall be considered free from all responsibility or liability as to what may have occurred or may yet occur on Keppel Island.</blockquote></blockquote><p>He goes on to dispel any rumour that the party was interested in moving to Saunders Island, his own presence there being to beach and repair his vessel.</p><p>He seems to have been a difficult man to get on with and when the Reverend GP <a href=\"/biographies/despard_george\">DESPARD</a> arrived on 30 June 1856 to be superintendent, he and Snow differed strongly in their views on how the mission should be run. Indeed Snow was at variance with the Society from the time of his arrival in the Falklands, having firm views of his own on the administration of the station and the missionary effort to South America. On 29 September 1856, soon after Despard's arrival, Snow was dismissed from his command of the <em>Allen Gardiner </em>and was forced to return to England where he continued to appeal against his treatment by the Society for many years. He eventually lost a three year lawsuit and this cost him the profits from his book <em>A Two Years Cruise off Tierra del Fuego the Falkland Islands etc </em>(1857) on the cruises of the <em>Allen Gardiner. </em>His account of the region and the early history of the British colony must be considered his most valuable legacy to the Falklands. A charming painting of Keppel Island attributed to him has been presented to Stanley Museum.</p><p>He went to America where he lived near New York, writing and editing books. On his return to England he continued to dwell on the fate of Franklin and the last 20 years or so of his life were spent compiling volumes of indexes, of notes and of biographical records of Arctic voyages. He lived out his last years in poverty, and died on 12 March 1895 at Bexley Heath.</p><p>Snow was a man of strong feelings, which he liberally put in print, often landing himself in trouble. He railed against the Geographical Society for many years and Sir Clement Markham in particular. Markham was, however, gracious enough to recount in his obituary of Snow in the <em>Geographical Journal </em>: 'The enthusiast had many good qualities and was grateful for any kindness .... It is a melancholy story, and ... I for one am glad to say all that can be said of good for a brother Arctic'. JK Laughton wrote in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography:</p><blockquote><blockquote>Snow's unsettled life, his series of enthusiasms (including emigration, telegraphy, early closing of shops, and total abstinence), his disagreement (which spilled into print and the courts as well as into unpleasant accusation) with almost all in authority, and above all his obsession with the Franklin search, suggest mental disorder; and suffering from this he could not achieve success, despite his intelligence, talent as a writer, and skill as a mariner.</blockquote></blockquote><p>He is most honestly summed up by the historian AGE Jones: 'Snow was not a success. But he was a trier after a poor start and many disappointments. Many men would have given up but he kept trying to the end'.</p>",

        "body": "<p>mariner, was born at Darwin on 19 November 1915, the third child of Frank Pinkney Sollis, mason, and his wife Catherine Mary Sollis, née Axon. Jack's childhood was spent in camp at Goose Green and Port Louis, where he became fascinated with boats, spending much of his leisure time messing around in dinghies or on the farm cutter boats. This fascination was to lead him to spending his entire working life at sea; initially, at the age of fifteen, on the sailing ketch  <em>Perfecto Garcia  </em>(which belonged to 'Cracker' <a href=\"/biographies/davis_john1\">DAVIS)</a> and during the 1930s on the vessels belonging to the Falklands Islands Company Ltd, SS <em>Fitzroy </em>and SS  <em>Lafonia </em>. After his marriage to Maude Duffin in 1940, he served as coxswain on the Falkland Islands Government launch  <em>Alert. </em>It was for this work that he was awarded the British Empire Medal in 1946, in recognition for the often arduous task of providing the Falkland Islands Defence Force outposts of Charles Point, Mount Lowe, Tussac Point and Ordnance Point with the supply of provisions, mail and liberty (leave) for the duration of hostilities. This service was carried out regardless of weather conditions or time of day and his award reflected his total devotion to duty. On the arrival in February 1948 of the newly acquired government vessel MV  <em>Philomel,  </em>Jack joined her as coxswain. In 1949 he was promoted to master and served in this capacity until the  <em>Philomel </em>was replaced in 1967 by the purpose built MV  <em>Forrest </em>.  Jack took over as master on the new vessel and commanded her for the rest of his working life. In 1977 he was awarded the MBE in the Queen's Birthday Honours. During the morning of the Argentine invasion, 2 April 1982, he had the  <em>Forrest  </em>in Port William acting as picket boat and reporting the progress, as seen by radar, of the imminent invasion force. Jack Sollis retired from Government service in 1983 and was overcome by illness and untimely death while on leave in England in May 1985. His ashes are interred in Stanley cemetery.</p><p>During his seafaring days around the Falklands he was well known and respected by all who knew him, be it farm residents or members of the Royal Marines who used his vessel for passage. In 1977 the commanding officer of the Falklands detachment wrote to thank government for the 'invaluable service' which Jack Sollis had rendered to the Royal Marines, with 'his vast experience of these coastal waters'. He commented that the Islands were lucky to have Jack Sollis as master of the  <em>Forrest </em>. In his response the chief secretary wrote 'Your remarks concerning Jack echo, as you know, the views of us all here'.  Jack Sollis was equally liked and respected by his crew, who much admired their skipper for his good sense of humour and vessel handling capabilities. He was also a keen gardener which was reflected in the overall tidy appearance of his property at 20 Drury Street, always kept immaculate by the his labours and those of Maude. Sollis Rock, just south of Sedge Island, is named after him.  In the words of one Royal Navy hydrographer, 'Jack was the friend and patient counsellor of a succession of Surveyors in HM Ships <em>Protector  </em>and  <em>Endurance </em>. Even after his retirement, they came to his door to discuss their work at the start of a new surveying season. It is fitting that one of the maritime dangers to which he drew their attention now bears his name, ensuring that his contribution to the Admiralty Charts will be remembered as long as men voyage in these waters'.</p>",

Then he worked as a gunner with the <em>Telegraph </em>expedition in areas around Svalbard (Spitzbergen). During the summer season in the north in 1905, he was a gunner on the whalecatcher <em>Hauken </em>while his brother Søren Sørensen was gunner on <em>Ørnen </em>. The factory ship was <em>Admiralen </em>. At the end of the season in 1905 they returned to Sandefjord. The owner, Kommandør Christensen, had decided to send <em>Admiralen </em>and the two whale catchers to the south. Bernt and Søren both followed as gunners. The expedition started in the areas around the Falkland Islands, and later on they arrived at South Shetland. On one occasion <em>Hauken </em>did not have enough coal to get back to <em>Admiralen  </em>and the crew had to use furniture to make steam.</p><p>In 1907 Bernt and Søren Sørensen were two of the main shareholders in the new company A/S Tønsberg Hvalfangeri. The two brothers were employed as gunners on board <em>Karl </em>and <em>Mathilde </em>- the two whale catchers. In 1916 Bernt was badly hurt in an accident. The rope to the harpoon was lashed around his leg, and he was dragged overboard and under water as the gun was fired. He was rescued but his thigh muscle was torn off. He was lamed and this was his last season as a gunner. He stayed at his home called <em>Borgheim </em>until he died in 1924. Two small islands at the northeast side of South Georgia, used as a landmark, are named 'Søren and Bernt' after these two brothers.</p>",

        "body": "<p>Norwegian gunner and whaling manager, was born in Tjølling, now part of Larvik, in Norway on 17 February 1875. Like many young boys at the time he went to sea at only 15 years of age - first on board <em>Hvide Stjerne </em>, catching bottlenose whales in the Arctic Sea, then for one and a half years on the merchant ship <em>Aviemore.  </em>In 1892 he signed on the sealer <em>Jason </em>as harpooner searching for whales in Antarctic waters under the command of CA <a href=\"/biographies/larsen_carl\">LARSEN</a>. When Sørlle returned in 1893, he started navigation school, got his mate's certificate in 1894 and skipper's certificate in 1897. From 1894 until 1901 on board <em>Capella, Forsete </em>and <em>Mariane </em>, he caught bottlenose whales in the Arctic Sea.</p><p>In 1903 Sørlle left for the Faeroes where the company A/S Suderø had built a shore station in 1901, serving as gunner on the company's whale catcher <em>Suderø </em>. For several seasons he was the best gunner on the Faeroes whaling ground.</p><p>When the floating factory <em>Fridtjof Nansen (I)  </em>owned by A/S Sandefjords Hvalfangerselskab in the autumn of 1906 set off for the South Georgia whaling ground, Sørlle accompanied the expedition as gunner on board <em>Suderø </em>, one of the two catchers. Before whaling started however the floating factory foundered just off South Georgia on what is now called the Fridtjof Nansen Bank. In the chaos following the shipwreck, Sørlle saved several crewmen from certain death. (Over the years he saved 37 lives and was awarded the Norwegian lifesaving medal).</p><p>In the 1907/8 whaling season Sørlle once again was gunner on board <em>Suderø </em>when the new mother ship <em>Fridtjof Nansen (II)  </em>began operations from Stromness Harbour at South Georgia. In the 1908/9 and 1909/10 seasons he was whale gunner on board <em>Samson </em>, another of the mother ship's catchers working the South Georgia ground.</p><p>In addition to being an excellent gunner, Sørlle proved he had good leadership ability and this was noticed by the managing director of A/S Sandefjords Hvalfangerselskab, Peder Bogen. In 1910 he was appointed manager on board the floating factory <em>Svend Foyn  </em>owned by A/S Sydhavet, another company managed by Bogen which operated at the South Shetlands whaling ground. After two seasons as manager on <em>Svend Foyn </em>, Sørlle was called back to A/S Sandefjords Hvalfangerselskab and given the important mission of building the company's shore station at Stromness Harbour while at the same time he was to manage whaling operations.</p><p>He was manager at Stromness Harbour for all seasons from 1912 until 1931, except for the 1917/18 season when he was manager on <em>Svend Foyn I </em>at the South Shetlands and the 1918/19 season, which he spent in the company's offices in Sandefjord. On 20 May 1916, he welcomed Ernest <a href=\"/biographies/shackleton_sir\">SHACKLETON</a>, Frank Worsely and Tom Crean back to civilisation after their epic journey from Elephant Island. 'Who the hell are you?' he at first asked the dirty and exhausted arrivals, but then, recognising Shackleton, offered boundless hospitality.</p><p>Under Sørlle's management, Stromness Harbour enjoyed continuous development, especially in the 1920s. In 1931 when the station was closed down following the owners' decision to go pelagic with their new floating factory <em>Vestfold </em>, Stromness was a top rate modern operational station. With acute powers of observation and a gift for balancing the demands of owners and labourers, Sørlle made Stromness Harbour a peaceful place compared to the other stations at South Georgia during the troubled years after World War I. His decisions favouring the labour force were not always applauded by the managers of A/S Sandefjords Hvalfangerselskab (from 1920 A/S Vestfold after a merger with Hvalfangerselskabet 'Ocean' A/S), but they were always accepted.</p><p>After the station was closed down in 1931, Sørlle went back to Norway and Sandefjord for good.

        "body": "<p>German admiral, was born in Copenhagen on 22 June 1861. He was the youngest of five sons of Reichsgraf Rudolf von Spee from a Catholic Prussian family and his mother Fernande Tutein was Danish. He entered the Imperial German Navy at the age of 16 as a cadet and thereafter rose inexorably through the ranks as the German Navy expanded to meet the challenges of the Reich's territorial expansion in Africa and the Far Fast. Tall, of military bearing, von Spee was a commanding figure, blue-eyed with wavy hair, bushy eyebrows and a beard. He married in 1889 Baroness Margarete, daughter of Baron von der Osten Sacken of the House of Wangen and they had three children, two sons, Otto and Heinrich, and a daughter, Huberta.</p><p>He was made port commander of German Cameroon in 1887/8 and was appointed flag-lieutenant of the <em>Deutschland </em>in 1897, serving in the Far East until 1899. He took part with the international force in suppressing the Boxer rebellion and saw his first action. Later he became involved in weapons development before being appointed chief of staff of North Sea Command in 1908. Made a rear-admiral in 1910 he was appointed to the coveted position of commander of the East Asiatic Squadron in 1912 and promoted vice-admiral.</p><p>Life in the Far Fast in the pre-war years was socially demanding but von Spee did not allow this to distract him from his prime responsibilities and he kept his squadron at a high level of competence by vigorous training. The long distance from home necessitated continuity of service and this led to high morale and confidence, crucial factors in his successful move across the Pacific following the outbreak of war when he was pursued by the navies of five nations, Britain, Australia, New Zealand, Japan and Russia. Von Spee had detached one of the cruisers from his squadron, the <em>Emden </em>, to wage independent attacks on allied shipping, mostly in the Indian Ocean, which it did very successfully until sunk by HMAS <em>Sydney </em>. It must be said that the initiative was not von Spee's but that of the <em>Emden </em>'s captain but nonetheless he made the assenting decision promptly despite wishing to keep his squadron intact. The fundamental problem in moving a naval squadron vast distances in those days was coaling and von Spee managed this brilliantly, staying within international law and yet managing to keep his pursuers guessing his whereabouts.</p><p>A British squadron commanded by Admiral <a href=\"/biographies/cradock_sir\">CRADOCK</a>, comprising his flagship, the old cruiser HMS <em>Good Hope </em>, another old cruiser HMS <em>Monmouth </em>, the modern light cruiser HMS <em>Glasgow </em>and the armed merchant cruiser HMS <em>Otranto </em>sailed from the Falklands to confront von Spee off the coast of Chile in the Battle of Coronel. They were ostensibly supported by the elderly battleship HMS <em>Canopus  </em>but she was slow and unreliable and took no part in the action. In the one-sided battle <em>Otranto  </em>withdrew as she was out of her class and only <em>Glasgow  </em>escaped, <em>Good Hope </em>and <em>Monmouth </em>both being sunk with all hands. Cradock is on record as stating at Government House in Stanley that he did not expect to survive the battle with the German squadron. The humiliation of the defeat shook confidence in the Royal Navy at home and led to jubilation in Germany. There were recriminations with Cradock alleged to have disregarded instructions not to accept action unless supported by the <em>Canopus </em>. He was a brave man and a friend of von Spee's from their time in the Far East together but he was hopelessly outclassed in the range and speed of his ships and the experience and efficiency of the crews.</p><p>The Germans had much support in South America and von Spee and his squadron were feted in Valparaiso. Von Spee, however, retained his dignity and was very mindful that his own position remained precarious. At one function a toast was proposed to the damnation of the British Navy but von Spee, ever conscious of the vicissitudes of war and the quality of his opponents, would have none of it and walked out.</p><p>In the Islands news of the defeat at Coronel was greeted with alarm. A telegram was received on 6 November 1914 from the Admiralty warning them to expect an attack by the German squadron and instructing them to destroy all stores likely to be of use to the enemy. The governor was convinced that von Spee would wreck the Wireless Station and burn down Stanley. The Volunteers were mustered and instructed to resist an attack but to remain out of reach of the ships' guns, a seemingly impossible task. Women and children as well as many elderly persons were evacuated, surplus stores removed, papers and records concealed and shipping moved to isolated parts. The Islanders felt defenceless with HMS <em>Glasgow </em>and HMS <em>Canopus  </em>ordered to Montevideo to await reinforcements although the latter was ordered back to Stanley as a defence vessel.</p><p>Surprisingly von Spee did not sail promptly from the Pacific despite his correct assumption that powerful British forces would be sent to avenge the Coronel defeat. He had replenished his coalbunkers for the long journey home but ran into severe weather rounding Cape Horn resulting in the loss of his coal reserves carried on deck as well as damage to his ships. He considered it fortunate that they encountered the four masted British barque <em>Drummuir </em>laden with coal but the ensuing delay in finding a suitable haven for transferring the cargo and making good the storm damage proved crucial in the forthcoming battle. Von Spee consulted his senior officers on whether to proceed directly to the River Plate area or to divert to the Falkland Islands to destroy the British naval base there. Although the majority favoured bypassing the Falklands, von Spee ruled against them believing that the destruction of her only base in the area would disrupt Britain's naval power and enhance his own chances of reaching his home base.</p><p>In the event, a powerful British squadron under the command of Vice-Admiral <a href=\"/biographies/sturdee_sir\">STURDEE</a> arrived at Port Stanley on 7 December 1914 and was coaling the following morning when the vanguard of von Spee's squadron was sighted. Ironically, it was the <em>Canopus </em>which fired the first shots in the Battle of the Falkland Islands in which the Royal Navy fully avenged the defeat at Coronel. Four of the German warships were sunk, the only one to escape being the <em>Dresden </em>which was eventually located and destroyed off the west coast of South America. Von Spee put up a brave and valiant resistance but was hopelessly outgunned and the outcome was inevitable although he did make an unsuccessful attempt to save his light cruisers by sacrificing his two armoured cruisers.</p><p>Von Spee lost his life in a battle which he had foreseen, remarking when presented with flowers after his victory at Coronel that they would go well on his grave. His two sons also died in the battle, one on the <em>Gneisenau </em>and one on the <em>Nurnberg </em>. The two battles had been fought with great bravery and honour on both sides but with grievous casualties many of which resulted from complying with naval traditions such as continuing to attack stricken vessels because they could not or would not strike their flags.</p><p>It falls to few leaders to win the respect of both sides in battle. In a little over five weeks Admiral Graf von Spee, Commander of the German East Asiatic Squadron, inflicted upon the Royal Navy at the Battle of Coronel its first defeat in over a century and then, at the Battle of the Falkland Islands on 8 December 1914, suffered an overwhelming defeat and lost his life. Modest and chivalrous in victory, in defeat he displayed the qualities of a great leader with bravery, tactical awareness and the unreserved support and loyalty of his men, at the same time earning the respect and admiration of his opponents<em>.  </em></p><p>Almost exactly twenty five years later a German pocket battleship named after von Spee, the <em>Admiral Graf Spee </em>, was sunk after a battle off Montevideo on 17 December 1939 by a British flotilla commanded by Commodore <a href=\"/biographies/harwood_sir\">HARWOOD</a>.

        "body": "<p>airline pilot, was born in Liverpool on 7 February 1925, the son of William Henry Spencer, a motor racing engineer, and his wife Agnes, née Wilkinson. He was educated at Liverpool Collegiate. He was still at school on the outbreak of World War II, but volunteered for the Fleet Air Arm as soon as he was old enough, having trained briefly as a commercial artist. He served in the Far East where he was shot down and taken prisoner, fortunately just before the Japanese surrender. Spencer left the navy in 1946 with a report from his commanding officer that he was 'a keen and efficient officer, who has done good work instructing in the Aircraft Handling School.' In 1948 he was recruited to establish an air service in the Falkland Islands.</p><p>In November 1948 he and an engineer landed from the RRS  <em>John Biscoe </em>with two crated ex-army Auster aircraft and the Falkland Islands Government Air Service was born. The planes were assembled and first test flown from Stanley racecourse on 19 December. Islander opinion was sceptical about the project, but on Christmas Eve an emergency call came from North Arm where a six-year-old girl, Sandra Short, was seriously ill with peritonitis and needed hospital treatment. Her father, Archie Short, had carried her into the settlement on horseback, a four-hour ride from their house at Lion Creek. Spencer agreed to pick her up, asking that a landing strip should be marked out with sheepskins and a fire lit to show wind direction. Despite appalling weather, the flight was a success and Sandra's life was saved. Governor <a href=\"/biographies/clifford_sir\">CLIFFORD</a> wrote to thank Spencer for his 'ready response to the recent call for help for Sandra Short, despite the fact that it meant alighting on an unprepared ground which you had not previously seen'. The incident was reported in  <em>The Times </em>and in 1953 a dramatised version of the event in the form of a radio play called 'The Good Tidings' was broadcast by the BBC.</p><p>The idea of an air service had been vindicated. Spencer spent a further four years establishing FIGAS. In 1949 he was awarded a bonus by the Falkland Islands Government 'in recognition of the outstanding diligence and efficiency with which he has carried out his duties in the last year' . In 1950 he converted the service to float-planes, using Austers and a Norseman. When he left in January 1952, the Air Service was a Falklands institution and Government viewed his departure with great regret. A reference written for him refers to the 'far from ideal' flying conditions in the Falklands:</p><blockquote><blockquote>The weather is harsh and high winds are more the rule than the exception. The Government's air service started literally from scratch and Mr. Spencer had constantly to improvise and exercise his considerable ingenuity. The ground organisation was rough and ready and much of the work of this fell to be done by him too. Mr. Spencer's energy, determination and equability of temperament overcame the many difficulties which were encountered....he has had to make his own decisions about flying ...and the soundness of his judgement in these matters is proved by the fact that during his service here he has only had one very trivial accident, when no-one was hurt.</blockquote></blockquote><p>On his departure from the Islands Governor Clifford applied to the Colonial Office for a special gratuity to be paid to Spencer:</p><blockquote><blockquote>for his excellent work...initiating the internal air service.....He has at all times displayed the most commendable care and has given evidence of a judgement remarkable for one so young - he is only 27 now. The popularity which the air service has achieved locally is due almost entirely to the energy and enterprise which he has shown and the confidence which he has rightly inspired. <em> </em></blockquote></blockquote><p>Spencer flew for British European Airways for a while, but then transferred to Aden Airways becoming chief pilot and operations manager in 1964. However bush flying became increasingly dangerous as the political situation worsened, and in 1967 he returned to the UK to fly for Britannia Airways. He married Mary Walker in 1954: she predeceased him. He died on 20 October 2005.</p><p>Air travel transformed internal communication in the Falkland Islands and to Vic Spencer belongs most of the credit for its successful introduction. He was a true pioneer.</p>",

He commanded the paddlewheel steamer USS <em>Michigan </em>on the Great Lakes in 1855-57. Although born in the South, he remained loyal to the Union during the Civil War during which he commanded three ships in the Gulf and South Atlantic blockading squadrons and, in command of USS <em>Pawtuxet </em>, actively participating in the bombardments and landings at Fort Fisher in 1865. Both before and after the war, he commanded warships on the Pacific Coast and went on to command the Navy Yard at Mare Island in San Francisco Bay, 1865-69.

        "body": "<p>RC monsignor, was born on 13 January 1912 in Newcastle upon Tyne, one of four children of Alfred Spraggon and Sarah Spraggon, née Martin. At the age of 22 he joined the Mill Hill Missionaries Junior Seminaries, Freshfield (Liverpool) and Burn Hall (Durham), then due to the war, completing his studies at Lochwinoch in Renfrewshire. He was ordained a priest on the Feast of St Peter and St Paul, 29 June 1945, by Archbishop Donald Campbell in St Andrew's Cathedral Glasgow and appointed to Buea in British Cameroons. At the request of the Chaplain's Department - Army he was appointed chaplain to the Gold Coast West African Field Force in 1951. Here he worked for the well being of the military and their families until Ghana's independence, retiring with the rank of major and an MBE. He often referred to the African junior officers who later tried to restore order in their countries as 'good men'.</p><p>From 1954 till 1971 Spraggon was engaged in organising mission appeals in England and Wales and in North America, becoming organising secretary in Freshfield. The end of 1971 brought an appointment to the Falkland Islands with the right to succeed Monsignor James Ireland (who had served in Stanley from 1952). This also included the care of the 'Stella Maris' seamen's hostel in Montevideo, (which was then the link to the Falklands, via the RMS <em>Darwin </em>). It was while there that he had to conduct and arrange a service for those who died on board a Blue Funnel Line ship and their families. The incident left him with a fear of fires - especially unattended ones.</p><p>The early 1970s were a changing time for the Islands, especially with the Joint Declaration of Buenos Aires of 1 July 1971, regarding communications and mutual understanding. Msgr Ireland retired in 1973 and Fr Spraggon became the second Prefect Apostolic of not only the Islands themselves, but also of South Georgia and the British Antarctic Territories. Though not an 'ordained' bishop his power and authority were equivalent, except for 'ordaining'. He set about his office with vigour. Not only did he press continued teaching of religious knowledge in both junior and senior schools, but he had many a debate with several farm managers over education for the children of their work force, remarking 'What was wrong with an educated shepherd - perhaps they leave because they want to be educated'.</p><p>The second Vatican Council's changes put into effect by his predecessor were continued with renewed vigour. Hospital visiting was a daily event even on a Sunday - not only were Catholic families visited but those of other denominations. This also held good on the ecumenical side. Many joint services were conducted in a warm and friendly spirit, though when he had to be firm he was.</p><p>Contact with the vice-commodores of LADE and the heads of <em>Gas del Estado </em>and YPF brought its positive and negative aspects on both the political and religious sides. He made it clear that the Islands were British and that the people were British and wished and demanded to remain so. The mutual understanding was listening and working together for the benefit of both peoples and countries. On the 'religious' side he had often to inform the many visitors to the house that he - as monsignor - came under the Vatican directly and not Buenos Aires. An incident in 1981 when a visiting Argentine dignitary the Bishop of Entre Rios breached protocol by wearing his pontificals in the Islands while Spraggon was away led to a difficult situation. On his return Spraggon had to explain the situation as best he could, a grave misunderstanding on the part of the dignitary, but the monsignor's assistant had been in charge in his absence and the monsignor was still the prefect. In spite of these problems, relations within the Islands were cordial.</p><p>During his early years Spraggon's parents had died and he had been brought up by John and Kitty Anderson, from whom he had learnt the butcher's trade. In Cameroon he had kept pigs, in the Islands he would keep cattle. His cutting up of a quarter or half was a joy to behold - and his handling of the carcass showed a robust frame but belied a none too healthy body which he managed to hide so well. Sausages, brawn and soups were also his forte. His plans for a small herd of cattle ended as he watched cow and calf fall to some hungry soldiers in 1982. Rivalry entered the house building late in 1981 when Spraggon began the new presbytery and LADE their new house. Who would win? The slower but solid construction of Monsignor was still a-building on 2 April 1982 and its first residents were Argentine soldiers.</p><p>April 2 1982 saw a big change in the Islands - Spraggon's remarks to the visiting Argentine military invaders that they should leave, otherwise even the penguins would, were a mark of his future role. In full regalia Monsignor now strode around - talking, visiting, reassuring people all would be well. As Papal Representative on the Islands he enjoyed a unique position with the Argentine occupation power and especially with a former acquaintance, Brigadier Carlos Bloomer-Reive, first LADE representative, who was now the liaison officer between the military and civilians and often put his own future on the line. Many soldiers came to the house and on leaving were told, if asked why, to reply that they had been to confession. Three serious incidents occurred during this period which brought the monsignor into contact with General Menendez. The first the general was able to resolve immediately - the release of the young men held by the military. With regard to the other two - the transfer of prominent citizens and families to an unknown destination and the incarceration of the Goose Green residents - the general was unable to do anything. The monsignor warned him that he was in the Falkland Islands where people enjoyed peace and freedom, not in the dictatorship of Argentina and not to treat people with contempt.</p><p>His joy at the victory of the British forces was immense, but tinged with sadness at the death of so many young men. Clearing up the mess and the burial of the dead followed. He spent many hours in the cold hills with the undertakers searching for bodies, eventually culminating in the burials at Blue Beach and Darwin. The calls on his time were intense. Recovering from an aneurism he was caught in the hospital fire at KEMH on 10 April 1984 and was the last to be brought out - presumed to be dead. This incident left him very weak and even more afraid of unattended fires. Together with another survivor he was airlifted to Britain on Good Friday for treatment. He never really recovered, though he hid his frailty very well. His holiday at home in the (English) summer of 1985 was wonderful: encompassing all he had wanted to do and more, were his words coming down from the airport at Mount Pleasant to Stanley. Ten days later, on 27 September a second aneurism in the presbytery proved fatal. Perhaps another life lost to the war or the hospital fire. The superior general of the Mill Hill Mission, Bishop de Wit, officiated at his funeral at St Mary's. It was followed by interment at Stanley cemetery in the presence of many dignitaries and people and his faithful parishioners.</p>",

        "body": "<p>salvationist and clergyman, was born in Stanley on the 24 February 1924, son of a Norwegian sailor named Ole Albert Stevensen and his wife, Alice Maud Stevensen, née Rowland. His father had jumped ship, from an inbound whaler, in Stanley; hiding in the peat stacks until the ship left. Albert Stevensen's life in the Falklands was uneventful apart from two life-changing events. Through the ministry of Forrest McWHAN he came to know Jesus Christ as his personal saviour when in his mid-teens. The second was the outbreak of World War II, and the garrisoning of the Falklands. He volunteered to join the British forces, with other young Falkland men, and left the Falklands in 1944, returning only once for a short visit thereafter.</p><p>Their journey to the United Kingdom took nearly two months via the west coast of Africa, and Stevensen, no Viking, was seasick for much of the time. He was in uniform within a week of landing, and attended a reception on the 30 March 1944 at the Colonial Office, with his comrades. Of his service career his time in Jerusalem was especially significant, and on demobilisation he sought the full-time Christian ministry that he knew to be his vocation. On the 14 May 1948 he was commissioned into the Salvation Army in a ceremony at the Royal Albert Hall. On the same day Forrest McWhan led a service at the Tabernacle in Stanley to mark the event, and at which a letter from Stevensen was read. Most of his Salvationist career was based in East Anglia, and this may have been because, with no other British geographical ties, he had seen RAF service there. In this peripatetic ministry he met his wife, Madge (Margaret) Hill, also a Salvationist, and they married on 29 July 1950. They had two sons.</p><p>Then a further career change took place. He joined the Church of England and after training at Wycliffe Hall Oxford in 1961 he was ordained priest in 1963 and took up the demanding role of chaplain at Brixton Prison from 1964 -70. He had contact with some of those he met in that ministry for the rest of his life, and could count a number of successful conversions during these six years. Such a role could not be endured for long and his next step was to parish ministry at St Stephen's Wandsworth. In doing so he became the first and only Falklander to be a Vicar (and probably the only Salvation Army captain and prison chaplain too). Retirement at 64 was occasioned by heart problems that finally resulted in one of the first quadruple bypass operations to be carried out in Britain. He and his wife retired a few miles from Wandsworth to a house owned by one of their sons. Stevensen was a fine preacher, often adding tales of his childhood in the Falklands to his talks to the children in church, and a kind and generous man. He was proud of his Falklands heritage, and much enjoyed the annual reunions in London. He died on 7 January 1996 in Wimbledon, following a stroke. His wife died on 19 February 1999.</p>",

        "body": "<p>foreign secretary, was born on 6 November 1906 at Bromley, Kent, the only son of Robert Wallace Stewart DSc and Eva, née Blaxley. He was educated at Christ's Hospital Horsham and St John's College Oxford. After a spell as a teacher, he entered the army during World War II, emerging as a captain. He was elected MP in 1945 and when Labour were re-elected in 1964 was appointed secretary of state for education. He married Mary Henderson in 1941.</p><p>Stewart was secretary of state for foreign affairs from 22 January 1965 to 11 August 1966 and then again from 16 March 1968 to 19 June 1970. The post became secretary of state for foreign <em>and commonwealth </em>affairs on 17 October 1968 with the merger of the Foreign Office and the Commonwealth Relations Office. On 16 December 1965, UN General Assembly Resolution No 2065 was passed inviting the governments of Argentina and the United Kingdom to 'proceed without delay with negotiations with a view to finding a peaceful solution to the problem [of the Falklands]'. This launched a series of negotiations between the two governments during Stewart's two periods in office. The Argentines had raised their claim with Stewart when he visited Buenos Aires in January 1966 on the first ever visit to Latin America by a British foreign secretary and been rebuffed, although he still had to deny that he had discussed sovereignty on his return. HMG hoped to remove the mixture of government measures and general awkwardness by which Argentina obstructed travel and trade between the Falklands and the mainland.</p><p>When George <a href=\"/biographies/brown_george\">BROWN</a> resigned on 16 March 1968 he left Stewart the awkward political situation following the revelation of the Memorandum of Understanding to Falklands councillors and the brouhaha which followed their telegram to the House of Commons. Stewart was to spend considerable time and effort in the House defending the British Government's position in the ongoing talks between British and Argentine officials, preferring, despite his preoccupations with Vietnam, Rhodesia, the EEC and the Cold War, to come to the House himself rather than send a junior minister. He was aware of Conservative strength of feeling on the Falklands issue, once the Government's negotiating stance had been revealed. In a debate on 26 and 28 March 1968, much was made of Councillors' message. Opposition speakers asked why sovereignty should be discussed at all, if there was no intention to cede it, why there was such secrecy and why the Islanders were not being consulted. Stewart's defence was that, like it or not, sovereignty had to be discussed with the Argentines if there were to be any talks at all, and that talks were necessary both because the UN Resolution required them and to improve Islanders' communications with the mainland. He pointed out that the governor was able to take ExCo into his confidence and that such discussions were more likely to achieve agreement if conducted in secret. The object of the talks was 'to secure that there is a satisfactory arrangement ... only if it were clear to us that the Islanders regarded such an agreement as satisfactory to their interests'. Transfer of sovereignty could only be considered on that basis.</p><p>Suspicion was reinforced by rumours of what Lord <a href=\"/biographies/chalfont_alun\">CHALFONT</a> had said on his visit to the Islands in November 1968. This was reported to both Houses on 3 December, to critical receptions from the opposition. On 11 December a cabinet decision was taken to abandon negotiations on the basis of the Memorandum because of the Argentine refusal to accept that it should contain a statement that a transfer of sovereignty should be subject to the wishes of the Islanders. That day Stewart made a statement in the House about the progress of talks stating that there was 'a basic divergence' over the British government's insistence that no transfer of sovereignty could be made against the wishes of the Islanders but that talks would continue on this basis. He rejected suggestions that there was pressure on Islanders to change their wishes. The exchanges on the Falklands in a wide-ranging foreign affairs debate the next day followed a similar pattern.</p><p>Thereafter talks continued without prejudice to each country's position on sovereignty under the 'sovereignty umbrella'* until, on 21 November 1969, letters were sent by the British and Argentine representatives at the United Nations to the Secretary-General stating that 'the two Governments have continued negotiations and that, although divergence remains, special talks will begin early next year to promote free communications and movement in both directions between the mainland and the islands'. Both sides would continue their efforts towards 'a definitive solution to the dispute'. This begged the question of what that would be and once again whether sovereignty should be discussed. Stewart conceded in the Commons that Britain had abandoned the position that sovereignty was not for discussion. When Sir Frederick Bennett said that the Argentines were only interested in improved communications in the hope of a change of heart by Islanders, Stewart replied that it would be 'quite foolish' if, because the Argentines held this view, we sought to prevent improvement.</p><p>In his autobiography <em>Life and Labour </em>(1980) Stewart, referring to Gibraltar and the Falklands, wrote:</p><blockquote><blockquote>Some day, some historian may argue that Britain was short-sighted to maintain a running dispute with two important countries for the sake of tiny territories with few inhabitants, the more so as there were no major strategic or economic issues involved... It seems to me, however, that if Britain, or any other country, behaves as if she would do anything for a quiet life no matter what happens to people who have trusted her, this will not create an atmosphere favourable to peace.</blockquote></blockquote><p>Stewart was concerned about the United Kingdom's relations with Latin-America generally and took a considerable interest in trade, but that did not stop him standing up for the Falklands. The Memorandum of Understanding and the commitment to discuss sovereignty which went with it were a difficult hand to play. He appears to have coped as well as anyone could.</p><p>Stewart retired from Parliament in 1979 and accepted a life peerage. He died in London on 10 March 1999.</p>",

In 1937 he arrived at the Falkland Islands when his registration date for that year enabled him to function as colonial dentist, a Government appointment which at that time allowed private practice additional to the requirement to treat Government employees and their dependents free of charge. He thus became a member of the staff of the King Edward VII Memorial Hospital then headed by the senior medical officer, Dr George Kinnaird.</p><p>Still's scientific contributions to the history of health in the Falkland Islands were noteworthy and the most important of these was his disproving the allegation that Islanders were constitutionally subject to excessive bleeding so that all Falkland Islanders undergoing surgery suffered excessive blood-loss after operations. This myth was widespread so that Still was told before he left England that there were many haemophiliacs in the Islands. He therefore, during his three-year tour, examined the records of 1500 dental patients of whom 1200 had had dental extractions and found that only three showed evidence of such a tendency and none were true haemophiliacs. Nor did patients in the hospital theatre show evidence of excessive bleeding after general surgery in this period, despite the allegations of severe problems in this respect by Dr Innes Moir, principal medical officer, in his report for 1932. Still's investigations were in part included in Dr Kinnaird's annual Medical and Sanitary Report for 1939.</p><p>From 1943 to 1949 Still practised in Lagos, Nigeria, returning to Colchester in 1950.

Theirs was a large family of thirteen children. Stirling was the second son; a younger brother, Thomas, was to accompany him during the first three years spent on Keppel Island. Stirling's early experience of school was brief and soon ended as the result of a severe illness. For several years he lived at home, and was allowed to roam freely in surrounding countryside. He was then sent to an uncle to be tutored privately, and at the age of 18 gained entry to Exeter College, Oxford, where he gained a classics degree in 1851. While there, Stirling was introduced to Captain Allen <a href=\"/biographies/gardiner_allen1\">GARDINER</a>, soon to go out to the Beagle Channel in his vain attempt to bring the Christian faith to the Indians.</p><p>In 1852 Stirling was ordained deacon in the Church of England and served as assistant curate at St Mary's, Nottingham for the following two years. On 14 July of the same year he married Louisa Jane Phinn, daughter of Dr Phinn of Bath. Ordained as priest in 1853, he moved to Holy Trinity Parish, Nottingham as assistant to Prebendary TM Macdonald. During these years Stirling continued his interest in the attempted Christian mission to the Indians of Tierra del Fuego, and in 1857 was appointed full-time Secretary of the Patagonian Missionary Society. By that time the Rev G Pakenham <a href=\"/biographies/despard_george\">DESPARD</a> had begun his work as superintendent of the Mission on Keppel Island, which was to end so disastrously in 1859 with the massacre of eight members of the mission party at Wulaia, Navarin Island.</p><p>Despard and his family returned to England in 1862 and soon afterwards Stirling, with his wife and two daughters, Eleanor Maria (b1854) and Gertrude Louisa (b1860), sailed out to the Falkland Islands in the mission schooner <em>Allen Gardiner </em>as the second superintendent of the Keppel Mission. Arriving at Keppel on 30 January 1863, he found William <a href=\"/biographies/bartlett_william\">BARTLETT</a> in charge of the mission farm, and Thomas <a href=\"/biographies/bridges_thomas\">BRIDGES</a> responsible for the Indians.</p><p>Stirling then began a series of voyages in the <em>Allen Gardiner </em>to visit the Beagle Channel, Santa Cruz and Carmen de Patagonia where missionaries under his care were stationed. During his absences, Mrs Stirling, who had never enjoyed robust health, suffered from anxiety about his safety, from lack of sleep and the effects of winter's tempestuous weather. Stirling decided to move his wife, by then in very poor health, and daughters to live at Carmen de Patagones near the mouth of the Río Negro in Patagonia. They arrived there in August 1864, but Mrs Stirling died on 16 October 1864 from the effects of her illness. Stirling returned to Stanley with his daughters, leaving them in the care of Dr and Mrs William McClinton. Later in 1865 he set sail for England in the <em>Allen Gardiner </em>, taking with him the girls and four Indian boys. They arrived in Bristol on 11 August.</p><p>For a second time Stirling offered to go out to South America as superintendent of the Mission. He travelled out alone in January 1867, arriving at Keppel on 23 March. Almost immediately he set out with Thomas Bridges for an extended visit to the Indians of Tierra del Fuego. On his return to Keppel, he began to plan what turned out to be the first permanent stay by a European on the shores of the Beagle Channel. Stirling decided that the best way to gain the trust of the Tierra del Fuego Indians was to live among them. So in January 1869 he settled down close to the site of present-day Ushuaia, on the shores of the Beagle Channel, living in a sectional hut erected by the crew of the <em>Allen Gardiner </em>. He passed the next seven solitary months among the Indians, gaining their friendship, until the mission vessel called again with a letter that called him to London to be consecrated bishop of the Falkland Islands.</p><p>The ceremony took place on 21 December 1869 in Westminster Abbey. The year 1871 was occupied by his primary visitation of the diocese, and it was not until 14 January 1872 that Stirling was enthroned in St Thomas's Church, Stanley, by the Rev Charles <a href=\"/biographies/bull_charles\">BULL</a>. Now that Stirling's responsibilities extended to the care of all the work of the Anglican Church in South America (with the sole exception of British Guiana), the time he spent in the Falkland Islands was far less. Notwithstanding, Stirling retained his official address as Keppel Island, where the work initiated by Despard continued until the early years of the twentieth century.</p><p>Stirling married for the second time a widow, Lucinda McClymont, the daughter of Andrew and Julia Miller, on 3 May 1888 in Buenos Aires. She died in London on 11 December 1923.</p><p>It was after the peat slip of June 1886, which destroyed St Thomas's Church and the school, that Stirling launched an appeal to build a fitting cathedral for Stanley. The necessary funds were raised in the Falkland Islands, in England and in Buenos Aires. The foundation stone was laid by Stirling and Governor <a href=\"/biographies/kerr_thomas\">KERR</a> on 6 March 1890, and the cathedral was consecrated by Stirling on 21 February 1892. In 1900, at the age of 71, Stirling resigned his episcopate and retired to live in England. From 1901 to 1920 he was Assistant Bishop of the Diocese of Bath and Wells, and a Canon of Wells Cathedral. He died, aged 94, on 18 November 1923, and was buried in the precinct of the Cathedral.</p><p>In assessing Stirling's life and impact, there is no doubt that throughout the 38 years he spent in and around the Falkland Islands he exerted a strong leadership, not only in the church, but also in the wider community. He was a support to all, from governor to shepherd. He stood for the highest Christian ideals. He won the respect and esteem of all that came in contact with him, and his practical abilities and his robust spirituality impressed those who knew him. He was a true father in God to all those who were within his pastoral care. 'I fancy myself God's sentinel', he wrote, 'stationed at the southernmost outpost of His great army'.</p><p>The anniversary of Stirling's consecration as Bishop was commemorated in 1969 by the issue of four Falkland Islands stamps.</p>",

        "body": "<p>sea captain was born around 1654, probably the son of John Strong and Barbara Houlditch of Totnes, Devon. In 1678 he married a widow, Mary Hulcombe, who already had a daughter, and in 1689 Agnes, a daughter of Captain Abraham Holditch. He had no children.</p><p>His early career is unclear, but he was boatswain and then mate of the <em>Welcome </em>around 1680. He became chief mate on the <em>James and Mary </em>in 1687 during her successful expedition to recover treasure from a Spanish ship wrecked off Hispaniola, and her captain in 1689. A Royal Warrant in that year, naming him commander of the <em>Welfare </em>, authorised him to seize French ships and required him to transmit intelligence to the Admiralty. Trade was another purpose, but primarily he was to recover treasure from a Spanish ship wrecked in 1654 off the coast of Ecuador. Observations by Richard Simson, dedicated to the Earl of Radnor, supplement Strong's terse journal.</p><p>The <em>Welfare </em>was London built, about 270 tons, with 40 guns and a crew of 90, including officers and divers from the 1687 expedition. Strong sailed on 12 October 1689 and on 27 January 1690, having been forced south, he sighted land then known as Hawkins Land. Simson records quizzically that 'the inhabitants were exceedingly numerous. The pengwins gave us the first reception...mustered in infinit numbers they seemed to salute us with graceful bows...expressing their curiosity and good breeding'. He also noted eagles and 'hawks which though they had long wings suffered themselves to be taken up by our men'. A young fox (warrah) was kept until it jumped overboard. Simson concluded that 'if not quite destitute of wood the Islands would make a noble plantation. It bears good Herbage and a great variety of land and sea fowle'. Strong sailed into a sound '24 fathoms of water 3 leagues wide'. Noting that there were many good harbours he anchored several times for water and provisions. His landing is believed to be the first made on the Falkland Islands. One of the landing parties returned with 'Pengwins and other fowls and seals'. Strong cleared the Sound on 1 February, observing 'it is about 17 leagues - Fawkland Sound as I named it'.</p><p>The <em>Welfare </em>headed for the Magellan Strait, spending over three months battling through, and duly reached the area of the wreck, but failing to locate it reluctantly turned and headed for home, reaching North Shields (Northumberland) on 14 June 1691. The failure was aggravated by the loss of 22 men who died at sea or were killed or captured by hostile Spaniards, but trading and the capture of two French ships was some compensation. The ship's sponsors however lost an estimated £12,000.</p><p>Strong respected and was respected by his men. He was tough - 'the only man to hold out against the cold' - and brave with presence of mind. His employers had trusted him to keep account of the treasure from the Hispaniola wreck and although he was later arrested on a charge of embezzling silver from it, he was discharged after examination. He was suspicious of the Indians in the Magellan Strait and, while treating them civilly, described them as not to be trusted. But he misunderstood the superficial courtesy of the Spaniards and believed that they were trustworthy - until he lost eleven men who were being feasted on the coast when they were suddenly attacked by hostile Spaniards.</p><p>Strong died at Corunna (Spain) on 11 November 1693. In his will he left the residue of his estate valued at over £1000 to his wife Agnes, after bequests to her family and to his step daughter. His wife was buried at Littleton (Middlesex) in October 1749.</p><p>A memorial commemorating Strong's landing was unveiled near Port Howard in 1990.</p>",

        "body": "<p>admiral, was born into a naval family on 9 June 1859 at Charlton, London SE. His father was Captain Frederick Rannie Sturdee RN and his mother Anna Frances the daughter of a Colonel Hodson, the marriage taking place on board HMS  <em>Waterwitch  </em>at St Helena. He was educated at the Royal Naval School, New Cross, before entering the Royal Navy at the age of 12 on  <em>Britannia </em>. A midshipman at 14, Sturdee was promoted to full lieutenant before his 21st birthday, specialising in gunnery and later as a torpedo officer during service in the Mediterranean, North America and the West Indies.</p><p>His career continued its unabated progression through to the outbreak of war in 1914 when he was Chief of Naval Staff under the First Sea Lord, Prince Louis of Battenberg. At this point Sturdee's career was thrown in doubt by two events, first the resignation of Lord Louis because of his supposed German connections and second, the naval defeat at Coronel off the west coast of South America. Prince Louis was succeeded by Lord Fisher who despised Sturdee, probably because of an earlier peacetime clash between Fisher and Admiral Beresford in which Sturdee supported Beresford under whom he had previously served. The defeat at Coronel, which resulted in the loss of HMS  <em>Good Hope </em>, Admiral <a href=\"/biographies/cradock_sir\">CRADOCK</a>'s flagship and HMS  <em>Monmouth, </em>was the first sustained by the Royal Navy for over a century. Fisher blamed Sturdee for the defeat which was, however, surrounded by controversy. Admiral Graf von <a href=\"/biographies/spee_maximilian\">SPEE</a>'s German East Asiatic Squadron, which inflicted the defeat, was based at Tsingtao, China, at the outbreak of war in August 1914 and was ordered to proceed to the Pacific although one of his ships, the  <em>Emden </em>, was detached to attack Allied shipping in the area, which it did very successfully. Von Spee's remaining squadron comprised the armoured cruisers <em>Scharnhorst  </em>(the flagship) and the  <em>Gneisenau </em>and the light cruisers  <em>Nurnberg </em>,  <em>Leipzig </em>and  <em>Dresden </em>. The ultimate destination of the squadron was the west coast of South America where there was a strong German presence and much pro-German sentiment. The British naval presence in the area was limited and mainly comprised ageing and obsolete warships, the old battleship  <em>Canopus </em>which was unreliable in operation and slow in speed, the obsolete cruisers  <em>Good Hope </em>and  <em>Monmouth </em>and the modern light cruiser  <em>Glasgow </em>. The low priority given to the area stemmed from the need to spread British naval presence over vast areas to counter the threat to Allied shipping perceived as resulting from any break-up of the German squadron into independent units as occurred with the  <em>Emden </em>. A scheduled detachment to Admiral Cradock of an effective warship was thus cancelled. Late in October 1914 Cradock sailed from Port Stanley with his flagship  <em>Good Hope, Monmouth, Glasgow </em>and the armed merchant cruiser  <em>Otranto </em>, having made known in the Falklands that he did not expect to survive the battle he anticipated would ensue. What is not clear is whether he was then fully aware of his terms of engagement authorised by the Admiralty which required him to engage the enemy only with the support of the  <em>Canopus </em>which, predictably, was again deemed to be unseaworthy with engine trouble. In the event Cradock met and engaged off Coronel, Chile, on 1 November 1914 von Spee's squadron of five modern warships manned by experienced professional seamen. Cradock detached the  <em>Otranto </em>from the battle because of its ineffectiveness and the only other survivor was the  <em>Glasgow </em>whose superior speed proved vital.  <em>Good Hope  </em>and <em>Monmouth </em>were lost with all hands, a savage blow to British naval prestige.</p><p>This was the situation faced by the Admiralty in London with Sturdee, to his credit, advocating the detachment from the Grand Fleet of fast capital ships to form the backbone of the squadron needed to avenge Coronel though this was initially opposed by Admiral Jellicoe. However, a firm decision was made by Winston Churchill, First Lord of the Admiralty, and Lord Fisher, First Sea Lord, to detach the fast, powerful battle cruisers  <em>Inflexible  </em>and <em>Invincible </em>to form the nucleus of the British squadron and to join up with Admiral Stoddart's cruiser squadron at the Abrolhos Rocks off the Brazilian coast. Time was of the essence and when it was reported that both battle cruisers could not be made ready to sail before Friday 13 November Churchill issued an order under his own hand directing the ships to sail on Wednesday 11 November with a proviso that if work on them had not been completed the workmen must travel on the warships and be repatriated as and when opportunity arose. The significance of this decision will be seen later.</p><p>It remained for the commander of the squadron to be appointed. Fisher's dislike of Sturdee had led him to inform Churchill that he could no longer serve with Sturdee as his chief of staff. Churchill's response was to appoint Sturdee, who had been promoted to vice-admiral in December 1913, as commander-in-chief South Atlantic and Pacific with his objective the destruction of von Spee's squadron. This was an effective solution to the personal problems besetting Fisher and Sturdee which had not been eased by Sturdee remarking that he had originally proposed the detachment of capital ships. The clashes of personality between senior figures again surfaced at the Abrolhos Rocks when Captain John Luce of HMS  <em>Glasgow </em>, anxious to sail to the Falklands and to avenge Coronel urged Sturdee to advance his sailing date for the Falklands. A somewhat surprised Sturdee did, in fact, do so by one day, another highly significant decision.</p><p>The British squadron arrived in the Falkland Islands on 7 December 1914 and commenced coaling, initially of  <em>Bristol  </em>and <em>Glasgow </em>. At this stage defence of the Islands was limited to the old battleship  <em>Canopus </em>which, following the defeat at Coronel, had been alerted by  <em>Glasgow </em>at sea and had sailed back to Port Stanley but stopped only briefly. She was, however, ordered back to the Falklands to act as guard ship with her 12 inch guns, only to cause alarm and consternation among the population when her smoke was seen and thought to be from the German squadron.</p><p>Coaling was incomplete when the following morning lookouts on Sapper's Hill sighted the approaching German ships and alerted Sturdee who calmly finished dressing and took breakfast. The vanguard of the German squadron comprised the armoured cruiser  <em>Gneisenau </em>and the light cruiser  <em>Nurnberg </em>and their immediate reaction to receiving a salvo from the concealed  <em>Canopus </em>has intrigued naval strategists ever since. It was a very fine day with excellent visibility which meant that once the British squadron was out of the harbour and in pursuit of the German warships the result was not in doubt. It is argued therefore that the best opportunity for Admiral von Spee was to use his surprise arrival to attack in the confined waters at a time when the British warships were coaling and two of the cruisers had engines under repair. Von Spee, however, ordered immediate withdrawal once the distinctive masts of the battle cruisers had been observed. His available intelligence was below normal standards because the arrival of the battle cruisers was known to German interests on the east coast of South America but the news had not reached von Spee. His captains were not all in favour of an attack on the Falklands and if the Islands had been bypassed it is possible that he could have broken through to his home port. The German squadron had also been delayed by bad weather rounding Cape Horn which had resulted in loss of coal reserves being carried on deck.</p><p>Of the five German warships four were sunk, the only survivor being  <em>Dresden </em>which remained a potential threat until the following March when she too was sunk. Over 2,300 German naval seamen were lost whereas the British losses were in single figures. The success fully restored the Royal Navy's standing and brought widespread acclaim to Admiral Sturdee but Fisher believed that his tactics were flawed and that  <em>Dresden </em>should not have escaped. von Spee was, however, an outstanding tactician and at times outmanouvered Sturdee; but the British Admiral was also an able commander and tactician and used his advantages in speed and range to the full. He had also anticipated that von Spee might sacrifice his two armoured cruisers in order to give the light cruisers a chance of escaping. If anyone was to blame for the escape of  <em>Dresden </em>it might be Captain Luce of  <em>Glasgow </em>whose diligence in pursuing his immediate quarry to the bitter end might well have been a reflection of his determination to avenge Coronel.</p><p>It is generally acknowledged that the victory was the most significant and convincing naval action of World War I and although Fisher attempted to delay his return to the UK, Sturdee arrived to a hero's welcome and was fêted everywhere he went. He was created baronet and awarded a grant of £10,000, a substantial sum in those days. He was befriended by a grateful King <a href=\"/biographies/george_v\">GEORGE</a> V and this stood him in good stead in his continuing conflict with Fisher which had flared up following an acrimonious exchange of cables after the battle.</p><p>Given the critical time factor, Sturdee was a 'lucky admiral' for a number of reasons. Churchill had advanced the date of departure of the  <em>Invincible  </em>and the <em>Inflexible  </em>by two days. Any delay would have been disastrous, particularly for the Islands. Churchill had used Sturdee's appointment as C-in-C to resolve a dispute with Fisher. On the voyage south, Captain Luce urged Sturdee successfully to advance the date of sailing from the Abralhos Rocks (Luce reminded Sturdee of this following the action and received the same frosty reaction as Sturdee himself had received from Fisher in relation to the battle cruisers). The German squadron's arrival at the Falklands was delayed by bad weather and von Spee failed to attack upon his surprise arrival at Port Stanley. Finally the weather on 8 December 1914 was perfect.</p><p>Sturdee had, however, achieved his objectives and his career went from strength to strength. Upon his return to Britain he was appointed to command the Fourth Battle Squadron and took part in the Battle of Jutland. He achieved the ultimate rank of Admiral of the Fleet in 1921.</p><p>Admiral Sturdee had but a short retirement, dying at his home in Camberley, Surrey on 7 May 1925 at the age of 66 but not before he had played a major role in the preservation of HMS  <em>Victory </em>. He had married Marion Adelaide Andrews on 23 September 1882 and there were two children, a son, Lionel Arthur Doveton Sturdee (1884-1970) who later became a rear-admiral, and a daughter, Margaret Adela Sturdee who married CM Staveley who also became a rear-admiral. Their son, William Staveley, (1928-1997) became an admiral of the fleet, a remarkable family achievement of service and devotion for which Britain has much to be thankful. At Sturdee's funeral which took place at St Peter's Church, Frimley, there were no less than eight admirals as pall bearers, one of whom was Sir Richard Phillimore, the commander of  <em>Inflexible  </em>at the battle.</p><p>Sturdee features in a commemorative stamp set of 1989, marking the Battles of the Falkland Islands and the River Plate.</p>",

        "body": "<p>naval officer, hydrographic surveyor and farmer, was born on 18 November 1810 at Tregew in the parish of Mylor on the banks of Falmouth Harbour, the eldest son of Captain Thomas Ball Sulivan and Henrietta, née James. On 4 September 1823 Sulivan entered the Royal Naval College, Portsmouth, where he passed with distinction. His first appointment as a midshipman was to the  <em>Thetis </em>, where he remained until 1828, when she came into Río de Janeiro at about the same time as one of her former lieutenants, Robert <a href=\"/biographies/fitzroy_robert\">FITZROY</a>, was promoted in command of the  <em>Beagle </em>. At FitzRoy's request, Sulivan joined the  <em>Beagle  </em>on 15 December 1828, but in view of his approaching examination for lieutenant, his stay on board was short. On 12 February 1829 he joined the  <em>Ganges </em>and on 12 April the  <em>North Star </em>, for passage home. On 29 December 1829 he passed for lieutenant and on 3 April 1830 he was promoted lieutenant and, at FitzRoy's request, was again appointed to the  <em>Beagle,  </em>remaining in her during her famous voyage, during which he formed a lifelong friendship with Charles <a href=\"/biographies/darwin_charles\">DARWIN</a>.</p><p>On board the  <em>Beagle </em>Sulivan made two visits to the Falklands in 1833 and 1834. On her return to England in November 1836, at the end of her round the world voyage, Sulivan was placed on half-pay. On 14 January 1837 he married Sophia, the third daughter of Vice-Admiral James Young; eight children were born to the couple. In December of that year he was appointed in command of the schooner  <em>Pincher </em>for service on the west coast of Africa, but a few weeks later, again at the recommendation of FitzRoy, he was appointed in command of the cutter  <em>Arrow </em>to carry out surveys in the Falkland Islands. Sulivan arrived in Berkeley Sound on 15 October 1838. In spite of poor health he surveyed Port William, Stanley Harbour and Port Harriet, followed by Port Fitzroy, which he named after his former commanding officer, Port Pleasant and Kelp Lagoon, the eastern part of Choiseul Sound and nearby inlets. At the end of the southern summer Sulivan made for Río de Janeiro, from where he was invalided home, arriving in England in June 1839. The fact that he was attacked in the Falklands by a wild cow and severely shaken must have affected his health. Lieutenant William Robinson of the <em>Stag,  </em>wearing the broad pennant of Sulivan's father, Commodore Thomas Ball Sulivan, was appointed to the  <em>Arrow  </em>in his place. Sulivan was awarded £100 for his work in the  <em>Arrow </em>. On his return to England, Sulivan wrote an account of the climate and soil of the Falkland Islands, which was published in  <em>The Nautical Magazine </em>in 1841. His second in command, Lauchlan Bellingham <a href=\"/biographies/mackinnon_laughlan\">MACKINNON</a> also wrote an account of the  <em>Arrow </em>'s six months in the islands.</p><p>On 14 May 1841 Sulivan was promoted commander and on 2 April 1842 he was appointed in command of the brig  <em>Philomel </em>to continue the survey of the Falklands. He arrived at Berkeley Sound on 14 October 1842, where he found a party of officers which Captain James Clark <a href=\"/biographies/ross_sir\">ROSS</a> had left behind to carry out magnetic observations, Ross himself having sailed a month previously for St Martin's Cove in Tierra del Fuego. The only improvement that Sulivan found in Port Louis was a small house built by Mr JB <a href=\"/biographies/whitington_john\">WHITINGTON</a>; he remarked that Whitington's sheep 'have stood it so well, it shows the climate is well adapted to them'. Shortly after his arrival, Sulivan set off on a cruise, which took him nearly round both islands, returning to Berkeley Sound on 22 November, having climbed most of the hills to establish triangulation stations. On his return Sulivan found the  <em>Terror </em>and  <em>Erebus </em>at anchor in Port Louis, which enabled Ross to acquaint him with the exact position of Burdwood Bank, in the expectation that Sulivan would carry out a more accurate examination of the bank than Ross himself had been able to do.</p><p>On 1 April 1843 Sulivan returned to Montevideo, a month earlier than intended as a schooner bringing provisions for him had apparently been lost. Here, on 1 June, he was joined by his wife and his three daughters who had come out in the Falmouth packet in spite of the fact that South America at the time was in a state of insurrection. During the months that Sulivan was at Montevideo he carried out various surveys in the River Plate. On 6 November Sulivan returned to Berkeley Sound, taking his family with him in view of the unsettled situation in Montevideo. He was in time to assist Governor Richard Clement <a href=\"/biographies/moody_richard\">MOODY</a> move the settlement from Port Louis to Stanley, a move with which Sulivan agreed. During this visit Sulivan surveyed Burdwood Bank, as suggested by Ross. Sulivan's eldest son James Young Falkland was born at Port Louis on 16 March 1844; he was thought to be the first British subject born in the islands. Sulivan returned to Montevideo on 11 May 1844.</p><p>On 26 October 1844 the  <em>Philomel </em>sailed again for the Falklands, with Mrs Sulivan and her family on board. It appears that Mrs Sulivan set up home in Stanley during this visit since she made a small botanical collection from the vicinity of Stanley during one of the  <em>Philomel </em>'s visits to the Islands. Sulivan remained in the Islands until the following April during which he ran a line of deep sea soundings as far as Cabo Virgenes in Patagonia, entering Río Gallegos to water ship. He also sounded round Beauchêne Island and even managed to land on it.</p><p>Shortly before leaving the Falklands Sulivan encountered difficulties with Governor Moody, which he was forced to report to his senior officer, Commodore JB Purvis, in Montevideo. Moody had dismissed his private secretary, Murrel Robinson <a href=\"/biographies/robinson_murrell\">ROBINSON</a>, from his post. However, shortly after Robinson's dismissal he was received on board the  <em>Philomel </em>by Sulivan and his officers as he had always been. As a result Moody wrote to Sulivan stating that it was his wish that Sulivan and his officers should not continue to associate with Robinson. This Sulivan was not prepared to do as he felt he was not obliged to interfere in what he considered were matters of 'the most private nature'. A further disagreement between them arose when Moody attempted to send two mutineers on board the  <em>Philomel </em>for passage to Montevideo with a warrant for them to serve a twelve-month sentence in England. Sulivan at first declined to accept them saying that it was impossible to make a prison out of his ship. Eventually a compromise was reached and the prisoners were accepted on board without a warrant. Sulivan may additionally have been concerned that his wife and four children would also be on board for the passage to Montevideo.</p><p>Sulivan arrived back in Montevideo on 19 April 1845. At first his time was occupied in completing his charts of the Falklands and adding to his surveys of the River Plate. However, on 28 August active operations were begun by the combined British and French squadrons against General <a href=\"/biographies/rosas_juan\">ROSAS</a>, in which the  <em>Philomel </em>was to take part. In consequence Mrs Sulivan, with her children, returned to England. Sulivan took a prominent part in the ensuing conflict, which resulted in him being promoted captain on 18 November 1845.</p><p>When the promised command of another ship was not forthcoming and Sulivan saw no prospect of employment at sea, he began to suffer in health. In consequence he obtained leave from the Admiralty to go abroad for three years. Instead of going to the south of France, as advised by his doctor, Sulivan decided to go out to the Falklands instead, taking his family with him. In 1848 he chartered a sailing ship, taking with him some good stock animals. Mrs Sulivan and her family set up home in a house in Stanley, built by Sulivan, and now known as Sulivan House. While Sulivan was farming in the Falklands, Henry Norton Sulivan was born on 25 January 1846. For a time he was nursed by 'an Indian princess, descended from a royal South American line, a Diana of the chase' who was surely Antonina ROXA.</p><p>In 1850 HMS  <em>Rattlesnake </em>, Lieutenant Charles Yule, returning to England from a surveying voyage to the east coast of Australia, called at Stanley. (Thomas Henry Huxley, assistant surgeon on board the  <em>Rattlesnake </em>described Mrs Sulivan's house as black and unpromising.) After leaving Stanley, Yule took the  <em>Rattlesnake </em>to Berkeley Sound, where her naturalist, John Macgillivray, accompanied Sulivan in order to watch his gauchos, one of whom was named Andrez Pelaluya (presumably <a href=\"/biographies/the_pitaluga\">PITALUGA</a>), catch some cattle required for the ship with lasso and  <em>bolas </em>*. The two landed on Hog Island, where Sulivan's herd of eleven hundred cattle and some horses had been kept during the winter to feed on the tussock grass fringing the shore. Sulivan's establishment was on the mainland opposite, reached by a ford at low water. When his three years's leave was about up, Sulivan returned to England in the autumn of 1851. Sulivan considered tussock grass ( <em>Poa flabellata </em>) to be of the greatest value and introduced it to a Scottish landowner who planted it in Stornoway, where it answered all expectations. Unfortunately it did not survive owing to the neglect of the injunction 'not to let the cattle feed on the plant', but to cut it for them.</p><p>With the outbreak of the Crimean War, Sulivan was appointed in command of the tiny paddle steamer  <em>Lightning </em>to assist the Baltic fleet under the command of Vice-Admiral Napier 'for surveying and pilotage duties'. This culminated in Sulivan making a survey in the face of the enemy of the approaches to Bormarsund, the Russian fortress in the Åland Islands, which led to its capture by allied forces. Sulivan's last service afloat was in command of the paddle steamer <em>Merlin,  </em>for service in the Baltic in 1855. In July of that year he was made a CB. He was made a Rear-Admiral in 1863, a Vice-Admiral in 1870 and an Admiral in 1877. In 1869 he was appointed a KCB. He died at his home in Bournemouth on 1 January 1890.</p><p>Sulivan was a staunch supporter and committee member of the Patagonian (later the South American) Missionary Society and was their nautical adviser. Together with friends, he raised enough money to fit out the mission schooner  <em>Allen Gardiner </em>and establish the society's local headquarters in Keppel Island, their main house being named Sulivan House in honour of their committee member. When the Rev G <a href=\"/biographies/despard_george\">DESPARD</a> was about to return to Tierra del Fuego, Sulivan wrote to the Hydrographic Office asking for an advance proof of the Keppel Island chart for him. The Sulivans' eighth child was named Allen Gardiner after the missionary Captain Allen <a href=\"?q=node/195\">GARDINER</a>, who died on the shores of Tierra del Fuego in September 1851.</p><p>Sulivan was an outstanding officer both as a surveyor and for his strategic grasp in time of war, which earned the admiration of all who knew him. A humane and amiable man with strong Christian principles he was reluctant to engage in hostilities on Sundays and on one occasion in the Baltic declined to bombard defenceless Russian infantry on humanitarian grounds. He is remembered by Sulivan House in Stanley, residence of the colonial secretary and later the chief executive. He also features in a set of Falklands stamps celebrating naval surveyors.</p>",

He and his older brother Len were educated at the Government School, Stanley. His father Sid was well known as the Radio Telephone operator, keeping remote farm settlements in touch with Stanley at a time when there was no inter-island telephone link.</p><p>Phil Summers began his working life as a messenger for the Electrical and Telegraph Department in August 1942, rising to clerk by 1944. In 1950 he was in the Posts and Telecommunications Department, then moved on to the Public Works Department in 1952. During this time part of his duties involved taking wages in cash to the government peat cutters wherever they were working, and to the lighthouse, where new accommodation for the lighthouse keeper was under construction. He was promoted to senior clerk in 1960.</p><p>Summers was married in 1949 to Dorothy Constance Sadler-Smith (Dot) and they had five children, Peter (b1949), Brian (b1950), Tony (b1952), Kelvin (b1953) and Una (b1960).</p><p>Summers was a long serving member of the Falkland Islands Defence Force, joining as a band boy in 1943 and rising to the rank of major in 1978. He was in command of the force from then until his retirement in 1983. During the royal visit in 1957 he acted as chauffeur to the Duke of Edinburgh. Summers was also a volunteer in the Fire Brigade.</p><p>In the early 1950s Summers led a very popular six piece dance band called the Melody Makers, obtaining sheet music of the latest dance tunes from England. In partnership with Ken Mills he also had 'the radiogram', described as a modified radio and record player, with microphone and two ex army loudspeakers, which produced music from 78rpm records for dances. This venture brought in much needed extra funds for both families. Summers also spent some evenings working as technician and announcer in the Broadcasting Station, and helped out as projectionist at Joe Booth's cinema in the Parish Hall.</p><p>In March 1967 Summers was appointed acting administrative officer at Grytviken, South Georgia for eight months, accompanied by his wife and the three youngest children. On his return to Stanley he joined the Treasury as senior clerk and in 1973 was promoted to deputy financial secretary. In 1981 he was appointed deputy chief secretary, a post he held until his retirement in 1983, when he and his wife left the Falkland Islands to live in England. Not content to rest, Summers then worked as accountant two days a week in the Falkland Island Government Office in London, until his death.</p><p>The church was an important part of his life, and Summers was a church warden at Christchurch Cathedral for many years. Until the 1970s the diocese included South America and in 1976 Summers went, with Desmond <a href=\"/biographies/king_desmond\">KING</a> and Leslie Halliday, to meet Donald Coggan, the Archbishop of Canterbury, at Lambeth Palace to discuss the split in the diocese, when the Islands became directly linked to Canterbury. After his retirement to England Summers continued his personal contribution to the church as a member of the Falkland Islands Cathedral Restoration Committee.</p><p>Summers' rapid rise in government service was due to his exemplary record, integrity and sheer hard work. The amount of other community based activities he packed into his spare time was exceptional, in an age when it was necessary to do everything for yourself, including cutting peat for fuel and growing vegetables. He died at his home in Market Deeping, England in 1991.</p>",

        "body": "<p>ornithologist and ecologist, was born in Broughty Ferry, Dundee, Scotland on 26 June 1947, the eldest son of Dr Ronald Summers and Doris Summers, née Bulloch. He went to school at Morgan Academy, Dundee, and was an undergraduate at St Andrews and Aberdeen Universities. His PhD was a study of Flounders on the Ythan Estuary north of Aberdeen. He married Judith Ann Dunnet in May 1974 and carried out postgraduate studies at Cape Town University (1974-1977).</p><p>He arrived in the Falkland Islands on 25 September 1977 and joined the Grasslands Trials Unit (GTU), which was investigating ways to improve Falklands' wool production. His role was to investigate the extent to which Upland Geese were affecting the wool industry. At the time, the Upland Goose was seen as a major competitor of sheep, and bounty schemes for killing geese were in operation. Although most GTU staff were based in Stanley, Summers and his wife were accommodated in a semi-detached cottage at Darwin.</p><p>The Upland Goose is a member of a small group of wildfowl called sheldgeese, all of which occur only in South America. There was a dearth of knowledge about the basic biology so, on the recommendations of and under the supervision of Professor George <a href=\"/biographies/dunnet_george\">DUNNET</a>, the work revolved round making descriptions about the life history of the birds. Basic demographic parameters were also measured: productivity, survival rates and numbers. Most of the studies were carried out near Darwin. However, there were longer trips to Cape Dolphin and Volunteer Point to round up moulting geese for marking. The results of the studies were reported in several scientific publications, and summarised in a book ( <em>The Upland Goose </em>) co-authored with Jim McAdam, an agronomist with the GTU. His knowledge of sheldgeese was expanded by trips to Argentina and Peru, where he studied Andean Geese, and led to him writing the species accounts for  <em>Bird Families of the World  </em>(Kear 2005).</p><p>At Goose Green, Dennis Middleton expressed an interest in the goose study. Middleton also taught Summers how to  <em>bolas </em>* geese, and they regularly went on outings to trap and ring geese. There was also a famous discussion about whether White-tufted Grebes could fly, an argument that was put to the test by catching one and launching it into the air - it didn't, or was it that it couldn't? The unfortunate bird was returned to the stream. Middleton continued observations on marked Ruddy-headed Geese which led to a joint publication on population turnover in geese in a scientific journal.</p><p>It was during their stay in the Islands, that Judy Summers gave birth to their son Mark (b1978) in Stanley. After leave in 1979, the family returned to Darwin. However, the second tour was cut short by Judy's illness, from which she did not recover. Her death effectively terminated his studies on the Upland Goose, though Summers did return for a short spell in August 1980 to tie up loose ends.</p><p>Summers continued to work on birds in England for the Ministry of Agriculture Fisheries and Food between 1980 to 1990 on Starlings and Brent Geese (both pest species), and latterly in Scotland with the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds on a range of birds of conservation concern, particularly in pine forests. He was re-married in May 1994 to Bozena Kalejta, a Polish ornithologist. They have one child Amanda, (b1995).</p>",

        "body": " <p>farm manager, was born near Bishop Auckland, Co Durham on 9 May 1870, the son of William Swinhoe and his wife Annie Elizabeth, née Fletcher. Ernest was educated at the National School in Maryport when the family moved to Cumberland in 1880. Nothing is known of Ernest's early working life until his brother was married in 1899 at St James's Anglican Church, Punta Arenas, Chile on 28 October. Although Ernest's name is not recorded as a witness on the marriage certificate, he was probably present at that service, and he may have emigrated to Chile in the early 1890s when he would have been in his early 20s. The Chilean historian Mateo Martini described Ernest Swinhoe's situation in 1905 as 'a well established resident of Patagonia, having been for many years a farm manager in the employ of Mauricio Braun', a Russian entrepreneur who in 1893 had founded an  <em>estancia </em>'Caleta Josefina' and later established a range of business interests under the name of Braun &amp; Blanchard at Punta Arenas and extending north into Argentina. It is possible that Swinhoe became involved in these developments.</p><p>Swinhoe first apparently became interested in South Georgia in 1903, when with a group of other landowners and farm managers, he responded to a public offer from the Falkland Islands Government, originally dated 1900, for interested parties to take a lease of the Island. The group had approached Charles A Milward, the British vice-consul in Punta Arenas, with the objective of obtaining a grazing lease of the island together with mineral rights and consent to undertake sealing. The lease proposed by the government would run for twenty-one years with the right for renewal for a further similar period. There would be a £10 annual licence fee for sealing and a £200 deposit as security. In addition a percentage of the net annual profits had to be made to the government, while a sum of £5,000 was to be expended on works or stock during the first five years.</p><p>Preliminary negotations for the lease were not begun until March 1905, when the South Georgia Exploration Company Ltd, registered in Punta Arenas, was born. Ernest Swinhoe, then some 35 years of age, became its manager. Being Chilean, the company caused the Falkland Islands Government some misgivings. The president of the company was Richard Lion and among its shareholders was Henry Kelway, an ex-Falkland Islands colonist. But there was some suspicion in British circles that they were acting as front men for 'less desirable' Chilean nationals. The rules of the company stated it was to have at least twenty and not more than thirty members, each of them subscribing 250 pesos or £16 5s 6d (£16·27). Swinhoe, Kelway and James Winther were named as those to explore South Georgia.</p><p>Swinhoe chartered the  <em>Consort </em>, 92 tons, a dandy-rigged sailing vessel which sailed from Punta Arenas in July under her master F Schwarz and nine crew (six of whom were Chileans) carrying stores, equipment, and a nucleus of stock, 24 sheep, three mares and one stallion. The  <em>Consort  </em>arrived at Port Stanley on 19 July. There, final arrangements for the lease were confirmed with Governor <a href=\"/biographies/allardyce_sir\">ALLARDYCE</a>, who reported to the Colonial Office that a two-year lease had been granted to the company.</p><p>Sailing from the Falklands on 31 July, <em>Consort  </em>sighted South Georgia on 9 August and sailed along the east coast of the Island to look for the best landing place, anchoring briefly in Possession Bay. Swinhoe arrived in Cumberland Bay on 14 August in the depths of the South Georgia winter and a small whaling steamer flying the Argentine flag came over to see them. Swinhoe was astonished to learn that an Argentine company had already set up a whaling station on the Island. He sailed into Grytviken, where the expedition pitched their tent, landed their animals and made contact with Captain Lauritz E Larsen, the Norwegian under-manager of the whaling station.</p><p>During the one and a half months that the expedition remained at South Georgia an uncomfortable relation existed between the two parties. Larsen asked Swinhoe if he intended to stay, while Swinhoe protested that his company, at great expense, had taken out a lease for the whole island and was dismayed to find Larsen killing both seals and whales. Eventually, before leaving, Swinhoe handed Larsen a written protest dated 28 September, requesting his company to withdraw from the 'South Georgia Islands' and having deduced that the Island was not suitable for his intended purpose, sold off his stock to the Norwegians.</p><p>On his return to Port Stanley on 10 November, Swinhoe reported the existence of the Argentine whaling company to the Colonial Government. The net result was a period of intense and delicate diplomatic negotiations in Buenos Aires, London, Port Stanley and Punta Arenas coupled with an inspection visit by a British warship HMS  <em>Sappho </em>to South Georgia in early 1906. The outcome was that the Argentine company was requested to take out a lease for the area of land they had occupied at South Georgia. As for the South Georgia Exploration Company Ltd, they also negotiated a new lease, on similar terms to the Argentine company, with the intention of also entering the whaling trade. The company, however, lacked both whaling expertise and money. Eventually, in December 1908, having failed to raise more capital in both Punta Arenas and Buenos Aires, Swinhoe and his fellow investors sold their lease, with the consent of the Falkland Islands Government, to a Norwegian whaling company for £1,500.</p><p>Little more is known of Swinhoe's life. He was granted Chilean naturalisation letters at Punta Arenas in 1913, but no record has been found of his having married or died in Chile.</p>",

        "body": " <p>The Tabaris Highlanders were a group of volunteers from the Anglo-Argentine community who arrived in Stanley shortly after the beginning of World War II, intending to assist in the defence of the Falkland Islands in the event of an attack by the German Navy. They had responded to much worrying comment in the Argentine press at that time on the possibility of German warships blockading transit through the Cape Horn route to Australia, New Zealand, and the Far East. Most Highlanders were either ex-regular soldiers or OTC members (according to one version), or former and practising rugby players (according to another). From the colonial secretary's files in Stanley we know that when the group (33 in all) arrived in the Falklands on 27 September 1939, six were rejected on medical and other grounds and returned to Buenos Aires almost immediately. Unfortunately, the 'commanding officer', a Major Morrough, was one of those rejected.</p><p>The remainder were enrolled in the FIDF, with Ronald Campbell made sergeant as their group commander and Thomas Dawson Sanderson as corporal. They left the Islands on 8 December 1939, once the immediate danger of attack from German raiders was judged to have receded. It was no slouch time for the Highlanders: they were digging gun pits, embankments, and protection of every sort from a possible German naval attack. While they were only in the Islands for just over two months, 22 of them applied from Stanley to join the British forces.</p><p>Sanderson was president of the Argentine Rugby Club, and a general sportsman with a handicap of 2 in golf. He remembered a difficult moment receiving a formal invitation to go to a function at Government House where formal dress had been stipulated. He called the governor and explained that regretfully the volunteers had not come the Islands to be entertained and so had not brought the appropriate dress for the occasion. The invitation was cancelled.</p><p>'Tabaris Highlanders' was surely an ironic name, derived from a Buenos Aires nightclub infamous in the 1920s and 30s for the amount of money spent there by <em>estancieros </em>and businessmen on girls, wine, and betting. It did not have a particularly savoury reputation and was not considered a respectable place for women. Although most of the 'Highlanders' were familiar with it, their wives were not.</p>",

        "body": "<p>actress and singer, was born on 13 April 1871 in Stanley, the daughter of William Charles <a href=\"/biographies/terriss_william\">TERRISS</a> (an actor whose real name was Lewin) and his wife Isabel, née Lewis, whose stage name was Amy Fellowes. Ellaline was born in The Ship Hotel, now the Upland Goose Hotel, and her autobiography claims that a plaque on the door of the hotel read: 'In this house the great actress Ellaline Terriss was born'.</p><p>Her father had taken his wife to the Islands at a time when his career as an actor was not prospering, to try his hand at sheep farming, going into partnership with Captain <a href=\"/biographies/packe_robert\">PACKE</a>. Unfortunately Isabel Terriss disliked life in the Islands, and the advent of a baby daughter enabled her to persuade her husband to leave when Ellaline was only two weeks old. Her mother's views must have been responsible for the bizarre description of life in the Islands in Ellaline's autobiography <em>A Little Bit of String.  </em>Her mother, she wrote:</p><blockquote><blockquote>was one of the very first white women to go to the Falkland Islands - in an unofficial capacity - and the natives went quite wild about her. They insisted on crowning her with tufts of grass and they declared her a queen. They remembered Queen Victoria and they qualified the statement by proclaiming her Queen of their hearts.</blockquote></blockquote><p>And later describing her christening:</p><blockquote><blockquote>Everyone who was anybody was there, which meant everyone from the Governor (Colonel <a href=\"/biographies/darcy_george\">D'ARCY)</a> and his wife and as many of the natives who could get time off, which meant most of them.</blockquote></blockquote><p>It is impossible to reconcile the account which Ellaline, or her mother, gave of the excitable natives, with the stolid British townsfolk of Stanley. None of their family ever returned to the Islands.</p><p>William Terriss made a brief foray to Kentucky for horse breeding, but this failed and the family returned to England at last in 1873. His acting career finally took off and from then on his success was assured. Ellaline was not a stage struck child, despite meeting such luminaries as Ellen Terry and Sir Henry Irving. However to please her father she acted in a one-act play at home and was summoned to play the same part in the West End. She was not quite seventeen and her career was launched. Possessed of beauty, charm and confidence, she came to epitomise the Victorian and Edwardian comedy actress playing in farce, music hall, melodrama and eventually the cinema. She played in most London theatres, but her name was particularly associated with the Gaiety.</p><p>In 1891 she met a young actor named Seymour Hicks (1871-1949) who proposed to her eight days later. Refused permission to marry by her father, they eloped. The wedding was less than romantic. Two witnesses, slightly drunk, were plucked off the street for a fee of half a crown each, and the wedding breakfast - for two - was Irish stew and Burgundy. Their 56 year marriage was extremely happy: Hicks was fortunately as talented as his wife. They often acted together and she frequently played under his management. Ellaline coped admirably with her husband's occasional fecklessness and his roving eye, knowing his ultimate loyalty was to her. Their only surviving child Betty was born in 1904.</p><p>The pair continued their busy careers, touring the world and going abroad to entertain the troops during both World Wars. Ellaline made recordings of her most popular songs and later took part in two films. In 1935, she retired from the stage and Hicks was knighted later that year. Ellaline Terriss's ability to exert a soothing influence on turbulent players caused her to be nicknamed 'the Oil Can'. She wrote her first autobiography <em>Ellaline Terriss by Herself with Others </em>in 1928 and <em>Just a Little Bit of String  </em>(after the title of her best loved song) in 1953. In her fifty-year career, she met everyone from Marie Lloyd to Noel Coward, and in her books everyone is praised - given her temperament it could hardly have been otherwise. She never aspired to be a great actress in the mould of Bernhardt or Duse, but she was supreme in her chosen field: that of musical comedy. Lady Hicks died in Hampstead, London on 16 June 1971, a centenarian.</p>",

        "body": "<p>actor and colonist, was born in St John's Wood, London on 20 February 1847 the son of George Herbert Lewin, an affluent barrister and Mary, née Friend. By the time he was sixteen, Terriss (to use his stage name) had parted company with four schools; he then joined the merchant navy - that lasted two weeks. Always a practical joker, he successfully masqueraded as Prince <a href=\"/biographies/alfred_ernest\">ALFRED</a> on a brief visit to Brighton - a foretaste of acting triumphs to come. Terriss then tried tea-planting in Assam - for a few months. Back in England his first professional engagement was at the Prince of Wales Theatre, Birmingham during the 1869-70 season. His part was unpaid but gave him the chance to show off his considerable physical strength and dash. He next persuaded the distinguished actor manager Squire Bancroft to give him a role.</p><p>Terriss was a brilliant horseman and swimmer (on several occasions he actually saved lives). When swimming at Margate, he was admired by a young woman called Isabel Lewis; a walk on the promenade followed, but Isabel was due to catch the 3 pm train back to London. Terriss put his own watch back a few hours and persuaded her that the station clock, showing 5.30, was wrong. They were married soon afterwards: she was 21 and he was 23: an idyllically happy marriage</p><p>Since his acting career did not appear to be making progress, Terriss decided on a characteristically adventurous move to the Falkland Islands. He had been introduced to the <a href=\"/biographies/packe_robert\">PACKE</a> Brothers who were farming sheep in the undeveloped West Falkland. Undeterred by his total lack of experience of farming, by the primitive conditions in the Islands and by his wife's pregnancy, the Terrisses set sail in the autumn of 1870. After being confined to their hotel in Montevideo by a yellow fever epidemic and a revolution, the family embarked in the schooner <em>Foam </em>and encountered one of the southern ocean's terrible storms. The ship nearly foundered. Their daughter maintained that her parents discussed whether to drown together or whether William should shoot Isabel and then himself. Terriss behaved with great courage through the ordeal, which was compounded by a shortage of food and water, until eventually they made landfall in the Falklands.</p><p>Sheep farms in West Falkland involved camping, so his wife had to stay in the settlement at Stanley. She did not like this, nor the way of life. Her daughter Ellaline <a href=\"/biographies/terriss_mary\">TERRISS</a> was born on 13 April 1871 and Governor <a href=\"/biographies/darcy_george\">D'ARCY</a> stood as godfather. The family had been five months in the Islands, but the advent of the baby enabled Isabel Terriss to persuade her husband to leave two weeks after the birth. In any case it is doubtful how far he was committed to life there - a letter to his sister on arrival makes it clear that he was thinking of a move to South Africa.</p><p>The passage home was not without incident: the crew mutinied and it was William Terriss's negotiating skills which brought about a reconciliation between crew and captain. The latter resented Terriss's role and deprived the family of food - they had to slaughter a goat (which the governor had given them to ensure fresh milk on board).</p><p>After an unsuccessful stay horse breeding in Kentucky, the family settled in England in 1872 and Terriss's career finally did take off at the Lyceum. His talent, charm, good looks and considerable stage presence ensured his success playing romantic heroes. He was by no means an intellectual actor, but, like his daughter, supremely good at what he did and much loved by the public. Sadly the career of 'Breezy Bill', as he was known was cut short on 16 December 1897, when he was murdered by a deranged actor, Richard Prince. The country mourned; fifty thousand people lined the route to the cemetery; and the Prince of Wales was among those who sent a wreath. William Terriss died at the height of his powers.</p>",

His father died when he was two and his mother suffered from poor health so his childhood and education were unsettled. Working for a firm of builders' merchants, he volunteered for the Territorial Army and joined the Royal Artillery on the outbreak of war. He rose to battery sergeant major and was commissioned in 1942. In 1944 he was posted to East Africa, but an accident meant that he was detached from the army to work with a district commissioner. Discharged from the army he stayed in Kenya and joined the administration as a community development officer and then district officer. He became an expert in Kikuyu affairs and the origins of Mau Mau and for his service during the Emergency was Mentioned in Despatches and awarded the MBE. He was next appointed the officer in charge of African Courts, a particularly congenial post given his interest in tribal customs.</p><p>After Kenyan independence, Thompson was appointed to the Falkland Islands as colonial secretary, arriving on 23 December 1963. When Governor Sir Edwin <a href=\"/biographies/arrowsmith_sir\">ARROWSMITH</a> departed, he became acting governor from May until Governor <a href=\"/biographies/haskard_cosmo\">HASKARD</a>'s arrival in October 1964. He became acting governor on several later occasions during the absences of the substantive governor. He was also appointed magistrate with jurisdiction in the Falkland Islands, South Georgia and the British Antarctic Territory in January 1964 and acting judge of the Supreme Court with similar jurisdiction in 1965.</p><p>During his term as acting governor in 1964, the first signs of Argentine aggressiveness became apparent with sightings of the warship <em>General Belgrano </em>just outside territorial waters and the arrival on 8 September on Stanley racecourse of one 'Senor <a href=\"/biographies/fitzgerald_miguel\">FITZGERALD'</a> who planted an Argentine flag to which was attached a badly written notice exhorting the inhabitants to 'rise against your usurpers'. Reports on this to the home government brought very little response, although Thompson remembers a signal about not upsetting trade with the Argentine to which Britain was selling thousands of tractors.</p><p>The task of communicating with London was difficult with only a Morse code link, not made easier by London's sending ninety per cent of traffic in one-time pad code. This included a new draft constitution which took Thompson and the governor's secretary two days to decode! The only other communication was by ship to Uruguay and then on by airmail. The voyage time was four days and with an average of only one ship a month for eight months of the year this was not a great help. Whenever he acted as governor he was also sworn in as high commissioner for the British Antarctic Territory although he never once set foot on the ice. He twice visited South Georgia though by the time of his first visit, the last of the shore-based whaling stations had closed with a drop in the population from about two thousand to fourteen headed by an administrative officer. Ships from the Japanese whaling fleet and the Russian deep-sea fisheries still called there, but on increasingly rare occasions.</p><p>In mid term Thompson and his wife took home leave and it was during this time in September 1966 that an Argentine civil aircraft, which just happened to be carrying the Argentinian 'Governor of the Malvinas' and his retinue, was hijacked to Stanley Racecourse. In England, Thompson contacted the Foreign and Commonwealth Office only to be told that it was not a matter of any great concern which it was thought could be dealt with 'perhaps by issuing visas'.</p><p>His personal interests while in the Islands were in founding the <em>Falkland Islands Journal  </em>in 1967, improving local broadcasting and starting the collection which eventually led to the re-establishment of the Falkland Islands Museum (though this came about long after his departure). He wrote children's stories based on Falklands wildlife which were broadcast on FIBS.</p><p>After the Falklands Thompson was appointed as administrator to the British Virgin Islands in 1969, but after a few months was sent to Anguilla where a revolution <em>against </em>independence from Britain was causing HMG considerable embarrassment, especially in the United Nations. Thompson describes this two year period in his life as Gilbert and Sullivan played backwards with no-one looking at the conductor! In 1971 he was appointed governor of Montserrat and in 1974 he retired to Essex. He worked for six years in local government and helped on a voluntary basis with Talking Newspapers for the Blind.</p><p>In 1963 Thompson married Sheelah Julia O'Grady a member of the Colonial Nursing Service who had served in Palestine, Nigeria and Kenya.</p><p>He was awarded the MBE in 1954 and advanced to CBE in 1968.

        "body": "<p>biologist, was born in Coventry on 21 October 1930, the eldest of three children of Francis Oscar Tickell and Amy Louise, née Noyes. After a nomadic childhood, he attended Lawrence Sheriff School, Rugby and was conscripted for national service in the army. On release in 1950, he attended Coventry Technical College and went on to the University College of North Wales at Bangor graduating in botany and zoology.</p><p>In August 1954 he joined the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey (FIDS), attending the Air Ministry Meteorological School at Stanmore, Middlesex and sailing in the old RRS <em>John Biscoe </em>. He spent November in Stanley before being posted to Signy Island in the South Orkneys. He helped build the second Base H (Tönsberg House) and began field studies of the resident petrels. The next year he became base leader, taking part in the survey of Coronation Island with Drummond Matthews and Douglas Bridger. On 11 September 1956, with Alan Grant, he made the first ascent of Mount Nivea (4,154 feet), the highest peak in the group.</p><p>On return to the United Kingdom in the summer of 1957, he remained with FIDS, writing Scientific Report No 33 on the Dove Prion <em>Pachyptila desolata  </em>under the supervision of Dr David Lack, director of the Edward Grey Institute of Field Ornithology, University of Oxford. In 1959 he was awarded an MSc (Wales) for this work.</p><p>Encouraged by Nigel <a href=\"/biographies/bonner_william\">BONNER</a>, but with minimal funds, Tickell and Peter Cordall (ex-FIDS) put together the South Georgia Biological Expedition 1958-1959, and sailed in the Christian Salvesen whaling tanker <em>Southern Opal </em>. After camping for six weeks in Elsehul, they went to Bird Island with Bonner, helped erect the small shed that later became known as 'Bonner's Bothy' and assisted in tagging 1,700 fur seal pups. After Bonner returned to King Edward Point they remained on the island for 15 weeks, setting up field-studies of albatrosses and surveying the island. Cordall's map (1:12,500) was an essential contribution and remained in use by later scientists for over 40 years.</p><p>Funded by the United States Antarctic Research Program (USARP) of the US National Science Foundation (NSF), Tickell returned to Bird Island in 1960-61 with Harold Dollman (ex-FIDS), again helping Bonner tag fur seal pups, then working on albatrosses. The following season, while Tickell remained at Johns Hopkins University in the United States, Dollman led the third albatross expedition, accompanied by Charles F le Feuvre (ex-FIDS). Together they banded 12,690 albatrosses, giant petrels and skuas and set out more study plots.</p><p>Albatross research at Bird Island was concluded with an 18 month study of Wandering, Black-browed and Grey-headed albatrosses (1962-64) again funded by NSF (USARP) and supported by British Antarctic Survey (FIDS had been renamed BAS) and RRS <em>Shackleton </em>(Captain David Turnbull). Three new huts were built and Tickell, Ronald Pinder (ex-FIDS) and Harry B <a href=\"/biographies/clagg_harry\">CLAGG</a> (entomologist) wintered in the largest, named Lönnberg House.</p><p>While putting together that last expedition in London in 1962, Tickell had married Willow Anne Phelps. When he came home in 1964 they went back to Baltimore and Johns Hopkins University where he wrote a dissertation on the great albatrosses for an ScD (1966). Other papers followed, culminating in 2000 when <em>Albatrosses </em>was published by Christopher Helm. Tickell's memoirs of the decade 1954-64, <em>Signy to South Georgia </em>await publication.</p><p>In 1966 Tickell joined the (Scottish) Nature Conservancy as warden naturalist for Shetland and Orkney until 1969 when he went to East Africa as lecturer in zoology at Makerere University, Kampala. Other appointments followed in the University of Nairobi, Kenya, Chancellor College in the University of Malawi and the National University of Lesotho. Eventually he and his family returned home where he became a television producer in the BBC Natural History Unit at Bristol.</p>",

Returning to England in 1938, he continued his education in Luton, and won a Royal Scholarship to Imperial College (IC) in London in 1946, where he took his degree in Geology in 1949. An important influence on his geological training at IC was Robert Shackleton, a distant cousin of Sir Ernest <a href=\"/biographies/shackleton_sir\">SHACKLETON</a>, and a single-minded enthusiast for field mapping in remote places. In 1949 Shackleton was appointed as Professor of Geology at Liverpool University, and invited Trendall to start a PhD in that department. By early 1951, while he was writing his thesis, Duncan <a href=\"/biographies/carse_verner\">CARSE</a> wrote to Shackleton asking if he knew of a suitable geologist for the 6 man South Georgia Survey 1951-52, and Trendall volunteered for the position.</p><p>Trendall's initial geological work on South Georgia went well, but on 1 January 1951, he lost his footing on a steep ice slope and slid unroped into an open <em>bergschrund* </em>; his recovery from 150 feet down took many hours. Although he escaped with his life, all the ligaments of one knee had been totally ruptured, and after being sledged back to Grytviken he returned to the UK on the first available ship. Following a reconstruction operation and many months of rehabilitation Trendall's leg at last regained mobility and strength, and by mid-1953 he accepted Carse's invitation to join the second South Georgia Survey, of 1953-54. In the weeks before departure he resigned from his assistant lectureship at Keele University, completed his PhD thesis and examination, finalised a FIDS Scientific Report on his 1951-52 work, and married Kathleen Waldon, a nurse he had met in hospital, who had played a pivotal role in his rehabilitation.</p><p>The four man South Georgia Survey 1953-54 was fraught with problems, and only two members (Carse, the leader and Trendall himself) remained for the whole season. But ironically, the latter's opportunities for geological work were enhanced by these circumstances, as he was able to land with sealers extensively around the island. On return to England he wrote up a second FIDS Scientific Report before joining the Uganda Geological Survey as a field geologist. In 1962 Trendall and his family moved to Australia, where he retired as director of the Geological Survey of Western Australia in 1986.</p><p>In late 2002 Trendall was contacted by Tony <a href=\"/biographies/bomford_anthony\">BOMFORD</a>, from whom he learned that Carse was still alive, and working on the book on South Georgia that had been planned for some fifty years; and in the following year he visited Carse in Sussex. After Carse's death in 2004, with his book still incomplete, Trendall began a thorough account of the South Georgia Surveys for publication, with the encouragement and cooperation of all surviving members and Carse's widow Venetia; this is now (2006) complete.</p>",

After gaining his degree at St Catherine's College Cambridge in 1933, where he received a half blue for the half mile, and then theological training at Ridley Hall, he was ordained in 1935 as Curate in the Parish of St. Mark's, Dalston. He moved to Cambridge for a year in 1937 and was then appointed youth secretary of the British and Foreign Bible Society in 1938. He served as a chaplain in the RAF Volunteer Reserve between the years 1939 and 1946 and was captured in Java in 1942 by the Japanese, remaining a prisoner of war for three and a half years. After the War, Tucker continued to work with young people, until he moved back into parish ministry in 1957 as vicar of Holy Trinity Church, Cambridge.</p><p>In 1963 Tucker was chosen by the Archbishop of Canterbury to be the next bishop in Argentina and Eastern South America with the Falkland Islands and was consecrated in Westminster Abbey on 18 October of that year. He was the last local bishop to have jurisdiction over the Falkland Islands. Tucker was given the task of creating a Spanish-speaking, Latin American, Anglican church, which was gradually to take the place of the then immigrant, English-speaking church. He presided over the division of the diocese, with the creation of the Diocese of Northern Argentina and Paraguay in 1969. This led in due time to the formation of CASA, the Consejo Anglicano Sudamericano, in 1974, which for the first time gave a collective voice and governance to the dioceses of the southern part of South America.</p><p>Up to this moment, the senior chaplain in Stanley and his congregation still remained under the jurisdiction of the Bishop of Argentina and Eastern South America. But CASA gave its member dioceses independence from the Archbishop of Canterbury, in particular in the appointment of diocesan bishops, and it was realised that this implied that the Anglicans living in the Falkland Islands would in time find themselves under the leadership of an Argentine bishop. This provoked a strong reaction from Islanders, so that arrangements were immediately made for Anglican work in the Islands to remain under the jurisdiction of Canterbury.</p><p>Tucker made many episcopal visits to the Islands, some of which were for weeks at a time. In 1975, he retired from the Diocese of Argentina but continued as bishop of the Falkland Islands for a further year until arrangements could be made for Canterbury to assume direct responsibility. During this latter period, he did not visit the Islands. In 1975 he was awarded a CBE.</p><p>After retirement he settled in Cambridge, with his wife Kathleen, née Merry, where he continued his enthusiastic support for the church in Argentina for many years more. He also derived much pleasure in building a modest philatelic collection of the Falkland Islands. He died in Cambridge on 2 September 1992, being survived by his widow and his three children, John (b1941), Rosemary (b1946) and Susan (b1949).</p>",

After serving in various ships, he was appointed to the 46 gun ship  <em>Stag </em>, Captain Thomas Ball Sulivan (father of Bartholomew James <a href=\"/biographies/sulivan_sir\">SULIVAN)</a> on 16 December 1836, then fitting out for South America, where Captain Sulivan took charge of the Brazils Station in the rank of commodore. On 17 November 1839, in Río de Janeiro, Sulivan appointed Tyssen to take command of the 10 gun ketch  <em>Sparrow </em>in place of Robert <a href=\"/biographies/lowcay_robert\">LOWCAY</a> and as officer in charge of the Falklands.</p><p>On 19 December, Tyssen anchored off the small British settlement in Port Louis, where he landed and took up residence in Settlement House, leaving John Seccome, his senior mate, in command of the  <em>Sparrow </em>. Tyssen took charge of the settlement from Lieutenant William Robinson of the  <em>Arrow </em>, who had been temporarily in charge on the departure of Lowcay. In Port Louis the ship's company of the  <em>Sparrow </em>were employed roofing the storehouse and building a corral. On 29 February 1840 Tyssen informed the Admiralty that he had ridden over parts of the island, finding several places suitable for the plough. He also reported that according to Basilio, the c <em>apataz </em>of the gauchos, there were 40,000 head of wild cattle and 4,000 horses on East Falkland and 100 cattle on West Falkland, but that the wild cattle were more difficult to catch each succeeding year. In addition, there were 14 milking cows and 190 tame cattle in the settlement, but that there was a great need for horses suitable for riding. Only one of the settlers had a garden and they were all reluctant to build decent houses. On 17 February 1840 Tyssen sent the  <em>Sparrow </em>to search for the non-existent Aurora Islands, reported to lie east of the Falklands, and then to proceed to Río de Janeiro for provisions; from where she returned on 24 April. HMS  <em>Actæon,  </em>Captain Robert Russell, visited Port Louis from 8-16 October enabling Russell to report that Tyssen's 'ability, zeal and active exertions for the improvement of the settlement, both public and private, deserved the greatest praise'. He added that Tyssen was much troubled by the depredations of North American sealers who had established themselves in many places on the islands off West Falkland and were taking not only seals but the wild cattle that Lowcay had transferred there. On 29 October the  <em>Sparrow </em>was sent to San Salvador, with Charles <a href=\"/biographies/melville_charles\">MELVILLE</a> as pilot, and later to Port San Carlos where several corrals were built, at least one of which was for horses. In January 1841 John Bull <a href=\"/biographies/whitington_john\">WHITINGTON</a> arrived in Port Louis with the  <em>Mary Ann </em>and the  <em>Susan </em>, a number of settlers, stores and other requisites to set up an establishment. Tyssen, who had not been warned of their proposed arrival, was informed by Whitington that he was duly authorised by his brother, George Thomas <a href=\"/biographies/whitington_george\">WHITINGTON</a> to take possession of certain lands and cattle in East Falkland (granted by <a href=\"/biographies/vernet_louis\">VERNET</a> to <a href=\"/biographies/langdon_william\">LANGDON)</a> and requesting Tyssen to put him in possession of them. Tyssen could only reply that he had no authority to do so. However, he had no means to prevent Whitington from landing and establishing himself and his party in Port Louis. On 6 February Tyssen reported that some trees he had raised from seed were doing well, but that all the riding horses were in poor condition and their gear very inferior. In a further letter a month later, Tyssen said he was much concerned at the depredation of the American sealers reported by Charles <a href=\"/biographies/melville_charles\">MELVILLE</a> and by Robinson, who had warned off several of them, but to no avail. In April 1841 there were 260 head of cattle in the settlement, which Tyssen supposed would be sufficient for the coming winter since British vessels were now calling much more frequently.</p><p>On 15 January 1842 the brig  <em>Hebe </em>, master CJ Anderson, anchored in Port Louis, carrying Lieutenant Governor Richard Clement <a href=\"/biographies/moody_richard\">MOODY</a>, with twelve sappers and miners and their families. Tyssen and Moody went overland on horseback to examine Port William and meet up with the  <em>Sparrow </em>. The two returned to Port Louis overland and on 22 January Moody landed from the  <em>Hebe </em>and formally assumed his post as the first governor of the Falklands. As Moody had no transport he detained Tyssen in order to make a cruise to the westward and down Falkland Sound, leaving on 11 February, but bad weather compelled them to return to Port Louis on 4 March. On 8 March Tyssen finally sailed for England, calling at Río de Janiero on 31 March and arriving at Chatham on 16 July, where he relinquished command.</p><p>In 1843 Tyssen was appointed to the schooner  <em>Montreal </em>on Lake Erie and in 1846 to the steamer  <em>Mohawk  </em>on Lake Huron. He was placed on half pay in August 1848, but was promoted commander on 27 February 1850 and captain on 1 April 1865, when he was placed on the retired list. He died on 21 December 1893 from senile decay at Burrington, North Somerset and was buried in Holy Trinity Church. He was survived by his wife Mary. Tyssen Islands were named after him, possibly by Robinson, who surveyed Falkland Sound in 1841-2.</p>",

She was the third child and the third daughter in a family of twelve and did not enjoy good health throughout her childhood. She was educated, as were her older sisters by the Salesian Sisters. Her two older sisters entered the Salesian Congregation to become nuns and two of her brothers became priests. In April 1894, now enjoying much better health, Mary Ussher followed her older sisters into religious life, and began her formation as a Salesian sister.</p><p>In 1909 she was sent to the Falkland Islands to become head teacher of St Mary's School. She travelled on board the  <em>Oropesa  </em>which almost <em> </em>ran aground on a sandbank a short distance from the Islands. When Sister Ussher arrived at the door of the Convent on 3 June 1909, the Sisters were totally taken by surprise, as they did not know when to expect her. She was known to her pupils as 'Sister Director' and, even today, her past pupils refer to her as Sister Director.</p><p>On the night of 12 November 1912, when the RMS <em>Oravia </em>struck the Billy Rocks, and about 200 passengers were brought ashore, Sister Ussher offered accommodation in her school for a group of about 40 third class passengers, and helped by the other sisters cared for these passengers during their five day stay. Again, in December 1914, after the Battle of the Falkland Islands, Sister Ussher put her school at the service of the community by setting up emergency wards and being ready to nurse should there be any wounded brought ashore.</p><p>She developed the school curriculum for her day pupils and set up evening classes in art, needlework and Spanish. Catholic girls from camp boarded at the Convent and Sister Ussher acquired Viti Cottage so that boys also could board. The Convent also provided residential care for Stanley children if and when there was the need.</p><p>In 1937, Sister Ussher was awarded the King's Silver Medal in recognition of her many years of service to the people of the Falklands.</p><p>She was one of the group of five Sisters who left the Islands on 3 June 1942. Thinking that they might be able to return and resume their teaching when the war ended, they took only their personal belongings. They did not return. Sister Ussher died in Buenos Aires 5 May 1949. Her obituary sums up her life in the Falklands and her contribution to the whole community. She was:</p><blockquote><blockquote>...a familiar figure in the life of the colony. She was a welcome figure among the population of Stanley. Her gentle, quiet, unobtrusive manner, her prudent and unaffected friendliness won the hearts of all who came in contact with her.

She and her family lived in a beautiful rambling house close to the creek, and which looked north over a deep valley. It was here that her interest in plants began, living as she did in one of the more remote and interesting areas of the Falklands. She and her sisters were all excellent horsewomen, though the younger sisters considered it boring to ride with Elinor because she was always stopping to look at or to collect plants.</p><p>Dean <a href=\"/biographies/brandon_lowther\">BRANDON</a> married Elinor to Robert Nichol on 1 June, 1894 at Roy Cove.

On board also was Rupert <a href=\"/biographies/vallentin_rupert\">VALLENTIN</a>, and collections of marine algae, ferns and flowering plants were received from both of them at the British Museum (Natural History) in February and March 1899.</p><p>Rupert Vallentin returned to the Falklands in the summer of 1901-2, to continue his collections. He and Elinor Nichol were married in March 1904, and lived in St Ives, Cornwall, then in 1909 moved to Mawnan, near the Helford River, south of Falmouth. She had studied botany at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew and on her return to the Falklands with her husband in 1909 she spent much time making careful coloured drawings of the local plants. Before she left England it had been suggested to her that the flowerless plants that reproduce by spores (crytogamic flora) would well repay investigation, nothing of importance having been added to the Kew collection since those collected by <a href=\"/biographies/hooker_sir\">HOOKER</a>; and this she did.</p><p>The Vallentins were in the Falklands for two years, and most of her collection of more than 560 specimens of at least 143 species of flowering plants came from West Point Island, Hope Harbour, Roy Cove, Shallow Bay and Port Egmont, all on West Falkland. These included the specimens used by Elinor for her coloured illustrations. About 400 specimens of marine algae, 50 species of fungi and many lichens were brought to the UK, all being very carefully packed and in excellent condition. These specimens are now at Kew, the British Museum and Manchester University Museum.</p><p>The Vallentins returned to England in 1911, and by November 1912 plans were being made to publish a book on the flora of the Falkland Islands, copiously illustrated with coloured plates drawn from living specimens. These botanical drawings had already been exhibited in Stanley, at a general meeting of the Linnean Society London, and at the exhibition of the Royal Cornwall Polytechnic Society, and are recorded to 'have met with universal approval'.</p><p>In April 1913 their son and only child, Thomas, was born and publication plans were postponed. In 1916 Mrs. Vallentin's health broke down permanently, and later her husband decided to issue the volume, entrusting the arrangement of the drawings to Miss Smith and the descriptions to Mrs EM Cotton. <em>The Flora of the Falkland Islands  </em>was published in 1921, and was very favourably reviewed in the <em>Times </em>, <em>Spectator </em>, and <em>Western Morning News and Mercury </em>.

Rupert was educated at private schools before working in Northern Queensland as a clerk in Court. Back in England at the age of 21, Vallentin inherited 'sufficient private means to satisfy his moderate requirements'. He was particularly interested in zoology, and studied for a time at the University of Munich, Germany. After working as a marine biologist on the Clyde, he moved in 1887 to Falmouth in Cornwall where he established a small laboratory to investigate the marine fauna of the Fal estuary. He was elected a fellow of the Linnean Society of London in 1889. Vallentin wished to compare Cornish fauna with that of a similar latitude south of the Equator and chose Stanley harbour. He sailed in the SS <em>Tanis </em>on 4 October 1898. On board was a young widow, Elinor Nicol (née Bertrand). They discovered common interests in natural history, spent time at her family home at Roy Cove and made collections of flowering plants, ferns and marine algae for the British Natural History Museum. In 1899 they also brought back collections of Medusae (jellyfish), Crustacea (jointed-limbed shellfish) and Diptera (two-winged flies).</p><p>Vallentin's second visit to the Falklands was in 1901-02. He clearly showed enthusiasm for fieldwork in the Falklands when he wrote (1904) that he considered himself lucky to have 'the most southerly zoological station in the world'. Vallentin contributed six valuable chapters on Zoology and Seaweeds to the first comprehensive book written about the Falklands by Violet F <a href=\"/biographies/boyson_violet\">BOYSON</a> (1924).</p><p>On his return to England, Vallentin brought back 'a few fragments of scratched rocks from a Penguin-rookery, and also a pair of Penguin's feet'. He left these with Dr Bowdler Sharpe at the Natural History Museum pointing out that the nails on the feet fitted the markings on the rocks. This material caused discussion and dissension amongst British scientists for years. Vallentin later sent a large slab of scored rock to Sharpe, who acknowledged the 'nice block of scored stone' in April 1904 but 'did not feel so sure about the marks being the work of Penguin's feet'. A long letter from Vallentin was read and photographs exhibited to the British Ornithologists' Club (BOC) in 1905.</p><p>Vallentin said that his attention had been drawn to this phenomenon by Arthur <a href=\"/biographies/felton_arthur\">FELTON</a> of West Point Island and that 'several of the more observant settlers' had known for years that the rocks over which the Rockhopper Penguins <em>Eudyptes chrysocome </em>climbed to their colonies 'become in time scratched by the nails at the ends of the birds' feet.' His photographs of grooved rocks were examined by the Club members, including one of a Rockhopper climbing a scored rock face that is still in the archives at the Natural History Museum (1902.11.22.4). Dr Bowdler Sharpe reminded members that expert geologists had 'expressed their opinion that the scores on the rocks were caused by the action of water &amp;c. and not by the claws of the Penguins'. After discussion, BOC members generally were of the same opinion. This scoring of steep and shiny rock surfaces is now well known at Rockhoppers' traditional landing sites. Vallentin believed himself to be the first person to place this on record; he was correct while the doubting geologists and ornithologists were wrong!</p><p>He married Elinor Nicol in Cornwall in March 1904 but they did not return to the Falklands until September 1909, for his third and last visit which extended until 1911. During that period, he collected more than 180 birds' eggs; some were sent to the Natural History Museum in 1913 but the majority were given after his death by their son Thomas (b1913). The value of Vallentin's marine fieldwork a century ago is still being recognised; some of his biological specimens were used in an investigation into the effects of oxygen availability on the maximum sizes reached by more than 2000 amphipod species worldwide, published in 2004.</p><p>His ornithological knowledge was less detailed and some of his comments have since confused ornithologists and museum curators. In his 1904 paper and the chapter 'Birds' in Boyson (1924), a few species are incorrectly named while characteristics of two species are described under one name. It should be remembered, however, that when Vallentin was in the Falklands and until a year before his death, there was no published material to identify Falkland birds.</p><p>A very important contribution to Falkland natural history was his personal and financial support for the publication, in 1921, of his wife's fine watercolour paintings of Falkland flowering plants and ferns. This book is now a collectors' item, being one of the last books published with hand-coloured plates. Elinor <a href=\"/biographies/vallentin_elinor\">VALLENTIN</a> died in 1924 and following her death, the family moved to Exeter. Vallentin died in November 1934 after about ten years investigating the freshwater fauna of the Exeter Ship Canal and making the initial discovery of a species of freshwater jellyfish.</p><p>His obituary appeared in the <em>Journal </em>of the Linnean Society of London where his former colleague, JT Cunningham, commented on Vallentin's love of nature and the open air and remarked on the thorough and systematic manner in which his work had been carried out. Though shy, solitary and sensitive in his youth, he had a strong character and developed the skill of making and keeping friendships with other naturalists. He deserved great credit 'for the real services which he rendered to zoology as collector and ecologist'. This must be one of the earliest examples of the term 'ecologist' which was not in popular use until the 1960s.</p>",

        "body": "<p>Italian Roman Catholic sister, was born in Scaldasole, Pavia, Italy on 19 July 1866. We do not have any details of her early education: she learned much of practical Christianity from her parents and when at the age of twenty-three she decided to become a nun, she was a well-educated young woman.</p><p>In 1889 she joined the Salesian Sisters, sister congregation to the Salesian Fathers, in Italy. Her superiors saw in her a woman very gifted in music, languages and needlework. They also recognised in her enthusiasm and the right spirit to be able to work on the missions. Before the end of 1889 she was sent to South America for her religious formation and arrived in Punta Arenas in February 1890. Her apostolic work kept pace with her formation as a Salesian Sister, both in Punta Arenas and on Dawson Island where her work was among the Onas Indians.</p><p>Sister Veneroni came to the Falkland Islands with two companions, arriving on 31 January 1907. Fr <a href=\"/biographies/migone_mario\">MIGONE</a>, the priest then in charge of St Mary's in Stanley, had invited the Sisters to come and take charge of the school. The mission house built by Fr <a href=\"/biographies/diamond_patrick\">DIAMOND</a> was prepared for their coming and would henceforth be known as the Convent. In preparation for coming to the Falklands, Sr Rose had to learn English and sometime after her arrival she adopted the English form of her name. She is always spoken of as Sister Rose.</p><p>Sr Rose and her companions began teaching 17 February 1907. Fr Migone recorded that on that first day, there were 60 pupils present and by the end of the school year, the roll stood at ninety-five. Sister Rose's contribution to the school curriculum was music, religion, art and fine needlework. She trained the children for their annual school concerts. She also gave music lessons in the evenings and was organist at St Mary's Church throughout the 27 years she spent in Stanley.</p><p>As bursar in the convent, it fell to Sr Rose to provide food for the passengers from the wrecked RMS <em>Oravia </em>who found refuge with the Sisters in 1912 for their five-day stay in Stanley. In the Convent she was at different times the mother superior and bursar. There is a touching example of real ecumenical collaboration between Sister Rose and Christ Church Cathedral. The words of the hymn <em>Furthest South </em>were written by the Anglican canon CM <a href=\"/biographies/hobley_charles\">HOBLEY</a> and set to music by Sr Rose: for many years the hymn was sung in the Cathedral and at St Mary's.</p><p>On 31 January 1932, the Sisters celebrated the Silver Jubilee of their arrival in the Falklands. Sr Rose was in declining health and two years later returned to Punta Arenas on 18 January 1934. Back in Punta Arenas she taught music to the novices at the Salesian Formation House. She died on Punta Arenas on 29 June 1935.</p><p>For 27 years, Sr Rose devoted herself entirely to the people of the Falklands. It was said of her that she did everything she could to enthuse the Catholics of Stanley. To her pupils in school and in her evening classes she gave an appreciation of the finer things of life. In her own capacity she contributed much to the personal and spiritual well-being of the people, but it was collectively as a group that the Sisters made the greatest impact in the Falklands.</p>",

        "body": "<p>entrepreneur and colonist, was born in Hamburg, Germany on 6 May 1791, son of Jacques Vernet and his second wife, Marie, née Simon; both were of French protestant (Huguenot) origin. Vernet spoke German and French as mother tongues, later learning English and Spanish. He called himself Ludwig, Louis, Lewis or Luis according to the language he was using. His family sent Vernet to Philadelphia in 1805 to join the trading house of Buck and Krumbhaar where he stayed with Lewis Krumbhaar who became a father figure. Vernet undertook several voyages to Brazil, Portugal and Hamburg and in 1817 founded a trading house in Buenos Aires with Conrado Rücker, also from Hamburg. On 17 August 1819, he married Doña Maria Saez a beautiful and cultured 19 year-old from the Banda Oriental {Uruguay}.  From this union there were to be six children: Luis Emilio, Luisa, Sofia, 'Malvina' who was born in the Falklands, and whose real name was Matilde, Gustavo and Federico.</p><p><strong>The Falklands Connection</strong></p><p>On 1 July 1821 Vernet created a separate company and also took up slaughtering wild cattle. He also acquired an estancia just south of the Río Salado where he raised cattle. Here one of his brothers, Federico, and one of his brothers in law, Captain Antonio Saez, were killed by the native Indians. In 1819, he had lent money to one Jorge <a href=\"/biographies/pacheco_jorge\">PACHECO</a>, who was in turn owed money by the Buenos Aires government. Pacheco was connected by marriage to Bernardo <a href=\"/biographies/bonavia_bernardo\">BONAVÍA</a>, a former Spanish commandant at Puerto Soledad (Port Louis). From him Pacheco and Vernet learnt of the wild cattle on East Falkland, and in 1823, they approached the government for the right to slaughter them. This was granted on 28 August 1823 and the two put an expedition together, in collaboration with a British immigrant, Robert <a href=\"/biographies/schofield_robert\">SCHOFIELD</a>. Shortly before the expedition sailed, Pacheco and Vernet hired a retired officer Pablo <a href=\"/biographies/areguati_pablo\">AREGUATI</a> as expedition officer and local leader and on 18 December 1823, they petitioned the government to grant him the title of unpaid 'commander' - and to supply cannon. The land grant was made that same day - on condition of a proper survey. But Areguati was not given any rank - or any cannon.</p><p>This first expedition was a failure. One ship, <em>Rafaela </em>, left in December 1823 and was reported lost. The second, <em>Fenwick </em>, reached Port Louis on 2 February 1824 but found conditions very difficult. A third ship, <em>Antelope </em>, brought Schofield and Vernet's brother Emilio, but after a month Schofield, who had mismanaged everything and turned to drink, left again for the mainland causing the expedition to collapse. In July and August the expedition's employees were paid off in Buenos Aires. The total loss was nearly 30,000 pesos.</p><p><strong>Recovering the loss - the 1826 Expedition</strong></p><p>The only way of recovering this lost investment was to try again. In 1826, Vernet did so; this time handling things himself. New articles of association were signed on 25 November 1825. Vernet also made out a bogus contract ceding his grant to two British men. Vernet submitted this and Pacheco's 1823 grant document to the British vice-consul Richard Poussett for countersigning on 3 January 1826. This may have been simply notarial, but it is possibly the first indication of Vernet's fear of attack, and search for British protection. He purchased the British ship, <em>Alert </em>, and the new expedition was fitted out. It sailed on 12 January 1826. Vernet had some 200 horses left over from his cattle slaughtering activities near Río Negro. But it was 13 May, before he could get the best of these on board and not until 9 June that he landed on the Falklands. Vernet had had to land far from Port Louis just to save the starving horses and it took a difficult five day journey to reach Port Louis, on 15 June. A few days later they found 22 horses abandoned after the 1824 expedition in fine health and with these some cattle were immediately caught. Fresh beef lifted everyone's spirits - particularly the gauchos'.</p><p><strong>The 1828 Concession</strong></p><p>Over the next 14 months, Vernet chartered or bought a series of vessels to bring supplies, horses and people to his tiny settlement.  Towards the end of 1827, he bought out all the remaining shareholders in his 1826 association. From then on he was alone. In 1828, Vernet approached the government in Buenos Aires in person with a colonisation proposal. He had despaired of ever repaying the money invested in his enterprise just from cattle. Instead he wanted to exploit the fishery and particularly sealing. Government aid was not possible, because of war with Brazil, but it offered to grant him East Falkland, if he would set up a colony himself which government could encourage with privileges. This led to the grant of 5 January 1828.</p><p>In addition to East Falkland, excepting the thirty square leagues previously granted to Pacheco, Vernet had petitioned for Statenland (Isla de los Estados, by Cape Horn), the right of fishery throughout the Falklands archipelago, and along the entire coast of the Republic, and freedom from taxes for 30 years. It was a breathtaking request - nearly all of it in places way beyond the real limits of Argentine authority at the time. Nevertheless, Vernet was granted all of Statenland (from where he could get wood) and what he wanted in East Falkland, except the land ceded to Pacheco (which Vernet later bought) and ten square leagues by San Carlos Water, which the government reserved to itself. He got the right of fishery along the mainland coast south of the Río Negro, and freedom from taxes for only 20 years. A condition of the grant was that Vernet had to form a colony within three years. This put him under constant pressure to get things done quickly.</p><p>But Vernet must have known about the British claim by then. So he submitted his land grant to the British Consulate, where Vice-Consul Charles Griffiths counter-signed it on 30 January 1828. Whether Vernet saw the British minister, Woodbine <a href=\"/biographies/parish_sir\">PARISH</a>, then is uncertain but Vernet certainly met Parish in 1829.  Newspaper reports in March had revealed that a <em>presidio </em>, (a penal settlement and frontier garrison), was to be set up in the Falklands - almost certainly in the ten square leagues reserved by the government in Vernet's 1828 land grant. This alerted the British embassy to the fact that Argentina had official designs on the Falklands - it would not just be Vernet slaughtering cattle. Parish asked to see Vernet and, on 25 April 1829, he reported their conversation to the foreign secretary, Lord Aberdeen. Parish described Vernet as:</p><blockquote><blockquote>a very intelligent man who has passed three winters there, and is now returning with several colonists. To be located according to his agreement with the [Buenos Aires] Government...He would, I believe, be very happy if His Majesty's Government would take his settlement under their protection: - He sails for the Falklands with his family in about a month, and intends to pass he says some years there in promoting the objects of this colony.</blockquote></blockquote><p>Vernet also provided Parish with a copy of his grants, and a description of the people at his settlement, which Parish sent to Aberdeen as well.  There were ten white inhabitants, natives of Buenos Aires, ten seafaring men, mostly English and Americans, Vernet's brother and brother-in-law, and 18 Negroes indentured for ten years and 12 Negro girls - 52 people in all. On the basis of these dispatches, the British Foreign Office instructed Parish to protest at this infringement of British sovereignty - this was before it knew about the formal Argentine claim to the Falklands which was to be announced on 10 June 1829.</p><p><strong>The <em>Comandancia </em>and British Protests</strong></p><p>Vernet had always wanted an armed ship with which to protect the seal fishery. In 1829 he approached the Argentine government of Juan Lavalle. It had seized power quite illegally in December 1828. But the Buenos Aires governor, General Martin Rodriguez, still managed to create the Falklands a <em>comandancia </em>- on 10 June 1829. That same day Vernet was made <em>comandante politico y militar </em>(CPM - military and civil commander) of the Falklands, although his appointment was never officially gazetted - and so was not strictly legal. Either way, Woodbine Parish reported everything to the Foreign Office on 26 June 1829. Vernet continued with his pro-British stance; even inviting Parish personally to invest in the settlement at Port Louis.</p><p>On 17 September 1829, Aberdeen by then also aware of the decree creating the <em>Comandancia </em>, again instructed Parish to protest. Parish finally handed Britain's formal protest to the Argentine government on 19 November 1829. Receipt of Britain's protest was acknowledged on 25 November 1829, but no reply was ever made. Argentina was in chaos, and there were probably more pressing things to do.</p><p>While Britain had been preparing and delivering its protest, Vernet returned to the Islands in the American brig <em>Betsey </em>, Captain Oliver Keating, with his own and five other families, German and British, 23 settlers in all. They arrived at Port Louis on 14 July 1829. The <em>Betsey </em>also landed 50 muskets, gunpowder, and six eight-pound cannons - but not a single soldier. It then sailed on to Isla de los Estados, to establish a sawmill there to supply the settlement with timber. Vernet's wife soon settled in. With her were her three eldest children, Emilio, Luisa, both still very young, and Sofia, still a toddler, plus their British governess, Miss Robinson. Matilde Vernet, better known as Malvina Vernet, was born in the Falklands - on 5 February 1830. With families there, the settlement assumed an air of permanence. It was now not just a temporary operation to end when the wild cattle were exterminated. Domestication was now the plan, so the cattle could be slaughtered and sold as demand required.</p><p>But Vernet was also trying to sell off land. On 29 October he sold ten square miles of land to a British captain, William <a href=\"/biographies/langdon_william\">LANGDON</a>, who had arrived in his ship the <em>Thomas Laurie.  </em>On his arrival in Britain, Langdon wrote to the British Government informing them of his land purchase and quoting Vernet as having no objection to British occupation so long as private property were not interfered with.</p><p>A British passenger with Langdon paints a glowing picture of the Vernet household with its good library of Spanish, German and English books, and music and dancing in the evening: 'Donna Vernet, a Spanish lady, favoured us with some excellent singing  which sounded a little strange at the Falkland Isles where we had expected to find only a few fishermen.' The diaries of Vernet's wife and brother Emilio confirm this - although with all the problems of a tiny pioneer society in dangerous times.</p><p><strong>The Sealing Problem - and Arrest of the American Ships</strong></p><p>Vernet was soon joined by Matthew <a href=\"/biographies/brisbane_matthew\">BRISBANE</a>, whom he made director of the seal fishery. Vernet says in his memoirs that while the settlers working the cattle did well, those going sealing faired badly - because of the 'depredations' of foreigners. He had warned several off; but Vernet was playing a dangerous game. He did not want fishing to stop. He wanted sealers to pay licence fees. The Americans were not going to co-operate - they had fished in the Southern Ocean for more than 60 years. But Vernet needed more than money - he also wanted their ships. In his 'circular' to foreign captains he warned that their ships would be forfeit if they infringed the regulations.</p><p>In mid 1831, Vernet arrested three American sealing vessels, the <em>Harriet </em>, Captain Davison, followed by the <em>Breakwater </em>and the <em>Superior. </em>The crew of the <em>Breakwater </em>overpowered their guards and escaped back to the United States where the account of their capture was published in October 1831, causing widespread concern. President Jackson referred to it in his State of the Union Address of 6 December 1831, and promised to reinforce the American squadron in the South Atlantic to protect American interests. In the meantime, Vernet made a bizarre deal with Captains Congar of the <em>Superior </em>and Davison of the <em>Harriet </em>, dated 8 September. This allowed one ship, the <em>Superior </em>, to leave under new articles to Vernet, to go sealing on the Pacific side of Cape Horn, while the <em>Harriet </em>went for trial in Buenos Aires. The fate of the <em>Superior </em>was to be bound by the judgement on the <em>Harriet </em>. The profits would go to Vernet, if the <em>Harriet </em>were condemned, but to the vessel's original owner if they were acquitted. Vernet was mixing his supposed public role as CPM with his personal business interests as director of the colony in a very dangerous manner. He anticipated that the vessels and their contents would be declared forfeit and that he would be the beneficiary. Vernet himself took the <em>Harriet </em>to Buenos Aires for trial, leaving the Falklands on 7 November 1831.</p><p><strong>The USS <em>Lexington  </em>and after</strong></p><p>The <em>Harriet </em>reached Buenos Aires on 20 November 1831 - and Captain Davison went straight to the US consul George <a href=\"/biographies/slacum_george\">SLACUM</a> to accuse Vernet of piracy. Slacum protested to the Argentine Foreign Ministry at Vernet's seizure of the three ships and at Argentine pretensions in the Falklands. Receiving no satisfactory reply from the Buenos Aires authorities, Slacum consulted Captain Silas <a href=\"/biographies/duncan_silas\">DUNCAN</a> of the sloop-of-war <em>Lexington  </em>and on 9 December, the <em>Lexington </em>sailed for the Falklands, with a vengeful Davison on board.</p><p>Slacum believed Vernet's colony threatened not just American sealing interests but might become 'another Cuba ...and our commerce round Cape Horn exposed to robbery and destruction by adventurers and vagabonds from all quarters of the globe'. Britain was also worried about the situation and Parish reported everything to the Foreign Office on 14 December 1831, enclosing a list of ships which had called at the Falklands, 'also a paper on the climate and production of the Falklands which Mr. Vernet has drawn up at my request'.</p><p>The <em>Lexington </em>arrived off Port Louis on 31 December 1831 and spent three weeks there, during which time <a href=\"/biographies/duncan_silas\">DUNCAN</a> took various steps to reduce the ability of Vernet's colony to harm US interests - he spiked the cannons, broke the muskets and burnt the powder. Mathew <a href=\"/biographies/brisbane_matthew\">BRISBANE</a> and six of Vernet's gauchos were arrested on a charge of piracy, and Vernet's Negro slaves and European settlers were induced to leave by warnings circulated by <a href=\"/biographies/duncan_silas\">DUNCAN</a> and Captain Davison that the settlement would be threatened again by US vessels. As a result, as well as the prisoners, Duncan took about 40 people away from the islands aboard the <em>Lexington </em>. Although most of them left as a result of these warnings, some had already been keen to leave. About 20-24 people remained at Port Louis: about fourteen gauchos, two black women, one child, and five Charrúa Indians. There is no evidence that Duncan's men did any significant damage to the houses. Accounts saying that the settlement was sacked or \"razed\" are untrue. The view of the United States Government and American sealers was that no sovereignty existed in the islands, and Duncan made a declaration to that effect. Accounts vary as to the precise wording of this. Statements later in the Argentine press by witnesses reported that he declared that the Islands were \"the common property of all nations\".</p><p>After this blow to his colony, Vernet and Argentina entered into a long legal battle with the Americans over the <em>Lexington </em>'s actions. This opened when a new American chargé d'affaires, Francis Baylies, arrived in Buenos Aires in June 1832. He rejected Argentine pretensions to the Falklands on the grounds that they were British, and so justified the actions of the <em>Lexington </em>. In the course of this exchange, Vernet produced a seriously erroneous report for Argentine Foreign Minister, Vicente de Maza, that has misled historians ever since. In this Vernet claimed that Pablo Areguati had been made a governor, which was untrue, and that David Jewett (who Vernet wrongly referred to as Daniel Jewitt) had found fifty ships in the Falklands when he arrived in 1820 and had told them to stop fishing (for seals) and leave. Perhaps Vernet just confused his own activities with Jewett's. But perhaps, in such a difficult situation, he sought to justify his own actions by pretending that he was only continuing what others had done earlier. Whatever the reason, that is the origin of these myths.  </p><p>The American diplomatic mission finally despaired and left Buenos Aires in September 1832 and the Argentines prepared to re-occupy Vernet's settlement, probably as an immediate snub to the Americans. But Vernet himself refused to return. He was effectively bankrupt, and stayed on in Buenos Aires trying to get the Argentine government to press the United States to compensate him for his losses. So the Argentine Government appointed a new commandant and sent twenty-six soldiers with him. This commandant, a Frenchman named Etienne <a href=\"/biographies/mestivier_joseph\">MESTIVIER</a>, reached Port Louis on October 6 1832, in the Argentine ship <em>Sarandi </em>. Just weeks later, on 30 November, he was murdered by his own men in a mutiny.</p><p><strong>The British Return and the Port Louis Murders</strong></p><p>The British chargé d'affaires in Buenos Aires had protested to the Argentine government yet again on 28 September 1832, reminding them of Britain's claim, and objecting to the appointment of Mestivier. Then, in January 1833, Captain <a href=\"/biographies/onslow_john\">ONSLOW</a> (HMS <em>Clio </em>) landed at Port Louis and reasserted British sovereignty over the Islands. He told the tiny 26 man Argentine garrison, which had arrived with Mestivier just three months earlier, to leave, together with the ship that brought them. But Onslow urged the handful of genuine residents to stay - and most of them did. He appointed Vernet's Irish storekeeper William <a href=\"/biographies/dickson_william\">DICKSON</a> as guardian of the British flag, and then left again himself.</p><p>Vernet sent Brisbane and three others back to the Falklands in March 1833. But Brisbane, Jean <a href=\"/biographies/simon_jean\">SIMON</a> (his foreman), Dickson and two others were all murdered in the Port Louis massacre of August 1833 by some of the remaining gauchos and Indians. The reason was a dispute over payment for the construction of a corral, and Brisbane's continued use of Vernet's own paper pesos to pay the gauchos, which they so disliked. This was really the end of Vernet's operation. He could not go back himself without losing Argentine support in his claim against the Americans. Later that year, the British appointed Lieut Henry <a href=\"/biographies/smith_henry\">SMITH</a> as naval officer in charge at Port Louis and Smith, and his son later kept Vernet's cattle business going. This lasted until Lieut <a href=\"/biographies/lowcay_robert\">LOWCAY</a> took over in 1838. It is from then that Vernet dated the final loss of his business and property in the Falklands.</p><p>The years after the British re-occupation were difficult for Vernet who was effectively bankrupt. He stayed in Buenos Aires trying to use the government there to get compensation for his losses at Port Louis. But such was the chaos in Argentina that no envoy left for the United States until 1839. There Vernet's case got little sympathy. He made several approaches to the British Government. In July 1834, writing via Woodbine Parish, he offered his services to the British Government, and asked for British support to re-establish his cattle business and for Britain to either pay for the damage to Port Louis, so his claim on the United States could be forgotten, or support his claim on the United States. Britain was unwilling to do either.</p><p>Parish supported Vernet as the best qualified person to develop the Islands and Vernet reminded Parish of their dealings before the British returned in 1833:</p><blockquote><blockquote>I rely much on the foundation of the opinion you gave me several times ... That my individual rights and grants would be confirmed by H.B.M in case of taking possession of those islands. I trust herein upon the generosity of your Government.</blockquote></blockquote><p><strong> But the British Government was not interested.</strong></p><p>In 1835, Vernet asked Britain for permission to return to the Islands and for £4,000, or even £2,000, with which to re-establish his cattle business, but without success. In 1836, Vernet proposed a deal with a Uruguayan General, Antonio Lavalleja, to re-finance his cattle business in the Falklands. The British minister in Buenos Aires disliked this idea and Vernet quickly abandoned it.  Later still, in 1838, Vernet sent a formal petition to the British Government to confirm his land grants, and to allow him to continue with his cattle business. It was all turned down, and Vernet was just given permission to go to the Falklands to take away his moveable property.</p><p><strong>The Worm Patent - Vernet in Europe</strong></p><p>In the 1840s Vernet developed a preservative for hides, a major Argentine export, often spoiled by worm, <em>polilla </em>. Vernet was granted Argentine and Uruguayan patents for this. He made the equivalent of ten thousand pounds by marketing it.  Financed by this money, Vernet sailed for Britain to press his case for compensation. On 7<sup></sup>May 1852, he presented his claim totalling £14,296 (about £28,000 with interest) to the British government. The wheels of the British government ground slowly, and Vernet's 1852 petition was sent out to the Falklands for the governor's comments. Only in 1856 did Britain make its first compensation offer. It would not, of course, recognise his claim to land, which depended on his grant from the Buenos Aires government. The cattle had been wild, and Vernet clearly had no real title to them either. His buildings were largely left by the Spanish, and were in very poor condition by 1833. But the British government did accept Vernet's claim for his horses, at only £20 per horse. The British offer was a total of £2,400, of which it proposed to withhold £850 against possible claims on Vernet from the Falklands - some of his paper currency was still there. Vernet rejected this in December 1856 and refused a later more forthcoming deal.</p><p>While in Europe, Vernet also visited his birthplace Hamburg looking for help in his claim against Britain. It was no use. The city government there replied that his parents had considered themselves French and had not taken Hamburg citizenship. Vernet also went to Paris, claiming that he had never taken out Argentine citizenship, to seek French help, again without success. In both Hamburg and France, he also promoted another South American land settlement scheme, in Bolivia, on land owned by Colonel Manuel-Louis de Oliden. It all fell through because of doubts over access, frontier disputes and the financial crisis caused by the Crimean War.</p><p>On 1 February 1858, an embittered Vernet finally accepted the British offer of £2,400, of which only £550 would be withheld. But the question of whether Vernet would waive other claims dragged matters on until May. Vernet had just received news of the death of his wife in Buenos Aires and was deeply depressed. He considered that his waiver of further claims was being extorted from him. After accepting the £1,850, and waiving further claims, he tried to reopen the matter in June 1858. But Britain held him to his waiver and immediately rejected this.</p><p><strong>Last Years</strong></p><p>Vernet returned to Buenos Aires ruined financially. But he had not given up and turned his attention to his claim on the United States where his daughter Malvina, had married an American named Greenleaf Cilley. They began lobbying the Argentine minister in Washington but without success.</p><p>The Falklands had effectively been forgotten by the Argentine government after the 1849 Convention of Settlement with Britain. In 1868, while Vernet was still alive, the Argentine government granted Isla de Los Estados, part of Vernet's 1828 grant, to the Argentine explorer and sailor, Luis <a href=\"/biographies/piedra_buena\">PIEDRA BUENA</a>. On 9 October 1869, Vernet signed a contract with his eldest son Don Emilio Luis Vernet, for him to pursue Vernet's various claims: against the USA (for the <em>Lexington </em>raid), against Britain (for unsatisfactory compensation), and against Silas E Burrows, owner of the <em>Superior </em>for non-fulfilment of the contract signed by Captains Davison and Congar back in 1831.</p><p>Vernet's contract with Emilio mentions him 'being old and requiring tranquillity' and he died on 17 January 1871 at his house in San Isidro, just outside Buenos Aires. He was buried in the Recoletta cemetery, Buenos Aires, beside his beloved wife, to be later joined by his sons Carlos and Emilio and his daughter Malvina.</p><p>But the Vernets persisted with their family claims. In the 1870s, hoping to increase their inheritance, Emilio and Carlos successfully petitioned the Argentine government for compensation for the loss of Isla de Los Estados. They also tried to get compensation for the loss of East Falkland - although this was not forthcoming. Then in 1884, they did get support from the Argentine government of President Julio Argentino <a href=\"/biographies/roca_julio\">ROCA</a> who reopened both the <em>Lexington </em>claim on the United States and the Falklands claim on Britain. The Argentine claim on the US was rejected by President Cleveland in 1885.</p><p>The grudge against Britain led to the 'Affair of the Map' in 1884 when the Falklands were included in a map of Argentina being prepared by the Argentine Geographical Institute. This led to British protests and marked the first step in the resurrection of the Argentine claim to the islands.</p><p>Louis Vernet impressed almost everyone who met him as a man of intelligence, charm and organising ability. But he could be highly authoritarian too. Although he is celebrated on Argentine stamps as a patriot, specialist Argentine historians consider him a traitor, because of his dealings with Britain, both before and after the British return to the Falklands. He was not always truthful in what he said, and his falsehoods have sometimes misled historians. Some Argentine historians even consider him to have been something of a cheat, and he certainly was mainly motivated by the prospect of making his fortune. This was what led him to seize American ships, which he hoped would become his property. This was folly. He must have known that the US maintained a squadron in the South Atlantic, and were likely to defend interests which dated back decades before his own arrival on the scene. His settlement, which had just begun to prosper, was destroyed as a result. This involved the fledgling Argentina in a dispute with the US which the Buenos Aires government had not sought. Apparently somewhat unwillingly, it then had to support Vernet, to protect its sovereignty claim. In turn, the British government then had to act to protect their sovereignty claim.</p><p>It is clear that Vernet's colony was essentially a personal venture and he looked to north European investors to settle the Falklands - not Argentines. He was prepared to place his colony under British protection, but once he had obtained an Argentine grant of land, Britain could not recognize his holdings. He is remembered by Mount Vernet west of Stanley.</p>",

He joined the Cartagena college of midshipmen in 1778 and on graduating he took part in the war against Britain , during which he was present at the capture of Minorca and took part in the blockade of Gibraltar. He was part of the escort of a convoy to Río de la Plata in 1783-4 and next sailed round the world in the frigate  <em>Astrea, </em>under the command of Alejandro <a href=\"/biographies/malaspina_alejandro\">MALASPINA</a> . This led to his selection as a sub-lieutenant for Malaspina's voyage to the Pacific . He was on board the  <em>Descubierta  </em>when Malaspina visited Port Egmont on West Falkland in December 1789 and again when Malaspina made a second visit in January 1794. During the voyage he was promoted first to junior lieutenant in 1789 and to senior lieutenant in 1793.</p><p>On the expedition's return to Spain, he served in the  <em>Pelayo </em>in the war against France. In 1796 he was promoted junior captain in command of the  <em>Descubierta </em>to carry mercury ores to the River Plate, where he was attached to the naval forces on that station. From there, in 1798 and again 1800, he was detached with his ship to the Falkland Islands to act as <em>comandante gobernador </em>or commandant of the Spanish settlement at Puerto de la Soledad (Port Louis). On 13 November 1799, during his preparations in Montevideo for his first tour of duty at Puerto de la Soledad, Viana reminded Viceroy Marqués de Avilés that Luis de <a href=\"/biographies/medina_torres\">MEDINA Y TORRES</a>, whom he was to relieve, had included two spare anchors, 120 fathoms of cable and a hawser, in his requirements for provisions and stores. While assuming that this equipment would be provided before the  <em>Descubierta </em>sailed for the Falklands, Viana informed the viceroy that it was on sale in the market at Montevideo adding that it was essential for the safety of the ships stationed in the Falklands but also, as experience had shown, it was needed to enhance their ability to render help in emergencies to Spanish ships of the Lima trade, which were often obliged by stress of weather to seek refuge in Puerto de la Soledad. On 28 November Avilés ordered that this equipment should either be supplied to the  <em>Descubierta </em>from the royal stores or purchased for her in the market at Montevideo.</p><p>In 1801, after leaving the  <em>Descubierta, </em>he was a member of the commission charged with fixing the borders between Spain and Portugal. In 1804 he was appointed <em>sargento mayor </em>of Montevideo and in <em> </em>1806-7 he took part in the defence of that city against the British. In 1811 he joined the revolutionary army against Spain with the rank of lieutenant-colonel and the same year he was promoted colonel in the garrison of Buenos Aires, later being promoted to the army rank of brigadier-general. He died in Montevideo in 1820. His diary,  <em>(Diario del viage explorador de las corbetas españoles Descubierta y Atrevida en los años de 1789 á 1794) </em>, giving brief details of Malaspina's two visits to Port Egmont, was published in Montevideo in 1849 'by Francisco Javier de Viana and other sons of the author', with a reprint in two volumes published in Montevideo in 1958.</p>",

Her father was a captain with the Lamport &amp; Holt Shipping Line and sailed the South American run between Liverpool and Buenos Aires. He was rarely home and Marjorie, as the eldest of five children and the only daughter, spent her teen years helping to raise her younger brothers.</p><p>She trained as a primary school teacher and then worked at various schools in Liverpool's working class districts during the 1930s. Here she strove to foster the potential in every child. With the end of the war in sight, she decided it was time to spread her wings and in 1945 accepted a three-year contract as the deputy head of the Stanley Primary School. She met Dick <a href=\"/biographies/vinson_richard\">VINSON</a> and at the end of her contract, they got married and she moved to North Arm as the manager's wife.</p><p>Her life experiences of helping in her own home, caring about the welfare of the children she taught, through to the resourcefulness required to live through the war, all equipped Marjorie for living in the Camp. She mastered the challenges and chores of domestication Camp style and ran a very productive kitchen and a welcoming home. The only Camp activity that she never enjoyed or mastered was riding a horse.</p><p>Marjorie never stopped being a teacher at heart and she always had time for children and the welfare of the Camp community. When the travelling teacher was not in the settlement, the children would go to the 'big house' every morning for school lessons. Her kitchen doubled as a clinic where all sorts of minor ailments were treated from applying hot poultices to boils to dispensing medicines and administering injections. Likewise with her tough love approach to caring, when the doctor at Darwin was called out, he always knew the three hour journey was necessary.</p><p>Her own two sons, David (b1950) and Kenneth (b1952) attended the same classes as the rest of the farm children until they were old enough to go to boarding school in England in 1962.</p><p>In 1964 the Vinsons moved to Darwin. The Camp manager's position requires a husband and wife team and the Vinsons were such a team and were able to compliment each other's abilities. Marjorie capably organised the house and an increasing amount of entertainment. The escalating sovereignty dispute with the Argentine increased both interest in the Islands and the number of official visitors. While acknowledging the difficulties, Marjorie was always a good ambassador for the Islands.</p><p>She was elected onto the LegCo in 1964 as one of the Camp representatives - the first elected woman member of council. Here she promoted improved opportunities for education for Camp children and the welfare of the community. At the end of her three-year term of office she was awarded the MBE for her many services. She was not one for airs and graces and received the award at a small ceremony at Government House.</p><p>Her husband retired in 1971 and the Vinsons returned to England and settled in Datchet, Buckinghamshire. Marjorie's eyesight unfortunately deteriorated but she never complained and always welcomed visitors to their home. The taking of Smoko was a tradition complete with a spread of home baking and a fair amount of reminiscing about life well-lived on the Islands. She died on 30 November 2000 at Datchet.</p><p><a href=\"/biographies/arrowsmith_sir\">See Image 12</a></p>",

        "body": "<p>farmer, was born at Yaxley, Suffolk on 16 December 1912, son of George Vinson and Ellen, née Mortlock. The family were modest East Anglian farmers and the young Vinson went to the local school. Unfortunately, he did not like school and left when he was 14 to help on the family farm. Looking for better opportunities, he went to the Falklands when he was 16 and worked on Saunders Island. His mother's younger sister, Jessie, had married Will Benny, one of the co-owners of Saunders. Life there was fairly tough but Vinson saw the opportunities in the Falklands and when the Bennys sold Saunders Island and moved on to South Africa, he stayed behind.</p><p>Vinson started his formal employment as a cadet at Port Howard (1932 and under the tutorship of Reginald <a href=\"/biographies/pole-evans_reginald\">POLE-EVANS</a> learned the skills of sheep farming. Vinson then joined the FIC in 1939 and worked on several farms including Walker Creek, Port Stephens and North Arm. In 1947 he was appointed manager of North Arm. In 1964 he was appointed Camp manager and moved to Darwin. In 1971 he retired and returned to England after living and working for over 40 years on the Islands.</p><p>Although he had failed to achieve at school, Vinson did have an excellent sense of logic. He always enjoyed being on top of the farm's figures and the challenges of dinner-table conundrums. This combined with a wily stockman's eye and an appreciation of the outdoor life made him an ideal sheep farmer. Throughout his career he worked at improving the sheep stock, the quality of the wool and the size of the clip. Through his farming genes and the Pole-Evans tutelage, he had developed a keen eye for good stock and he gave a lot of time and attention to selecting the stud flocks and checking the quality of the animals and the clip. At North Arm there was a small race between the holding pens at the back of the shearing shed and during any afternoon in shearing, he could be found there checking the quality and the consistency of the different flocks as they passed through the shed. When he moved to Darwin he applied his energy to improving the stud flocks on all the Company farms. For several years the Goose Green stud flock was kept at Burnside where he could keep a personal eye on it. In addition to a programme of selective breeding he also arranged for stud rams to be bought in to further improve the breeding stock and ultimately the clip.</p><p>Although a Camp man through and through, Vinson did have to go into Stanley to have his appendix removed. While convalescing after the operation, he met Marjorie Downs, one of the infant school teachers and they got married in 1948 at Christ Church Cathedral. Although the wedding was a low key affair and not a single photograph was taken, it was a very sound relationship in which they were able very successfully to complement and support each other, raise a family and contribute to the farm and the Islands community.</p><p>Vinson enjoyed every aspect of Island life especially riding and working with horses. In the spring, it was getting out into the Camp on horse back for lamb marking, seeing the young lambs and the satisfaction of good lambing figures. In summer, it was gathering and moving of sheep to and from the shearing shed. In the quieter winter months, he liked to tame his own horses and make and repair horse gear using the local untanned leather. He was a typical pioneer of his day and was renowned for fixing, renovating and reusing everything around the farm.</p><p>Vinson also enjoyed the Islands' wild life and was a keen photographer. When at North Arm, a favourite family holiday was to take the farm's fencing caravan, pulled by a tractor, and go down to Bull Point to see the penguin rookeries and the seal colonies.</p><p>On retiring to England in 1971, the Vinsons settled in Datchet, Buckinghamshire. Although commuter belt rather than rural village, its close proximity to London and the airport proved to be ideal. They were able to meet and host many Falkland Islanders on visits 'home' and so continue to keep in touch with their many friends on the Islands. After a long and active retirement, he died on 25 April 1996 in Datchet.</p><p><a href=\"/biographies/vinson_marjorie\">See Image 352</a></p>",

        "body": "<p>colonist, was born at Marridge Hill near Ramsbury in Wiltshire, to a family of prosperous sheep-farmers who had been established in the area since the sixteenth century. He was the third and youngest son of John Waldron and his wife Jane, née Martin. In 1866 his elder brother, James <a href=\"/biographies/waldron_james\">WALDRON</a>, visited the Falklands to examine the potential for sheep farming. As a result of this visit, both James and Henry took out leases on land around Port Howard. In September 1867 they arrived in the Falklands on the barque  <em>Diana, </em>carrying all the materials necessary to establish a settlement.</p><p>In 1874, once things at Port Howard were on a firm footing, Henry took out the lease of Beaver Island and gradually began to spend more and more time there. He bought the island outright in 1886 and continued to live and work there even after James returned to England in 1889. He was appointed a Justice of the Peace in 1881 and took his duties very seriously.</p><p>Henry Waldron never married and had (and perhaps cultivated) a reputation as an eccentric. When Governor <a href=\"/biographies/allardyce_sir\">ALLARDYCE</a> visited Beaver Island in 1906 he wrote of his host:</p><blockquote><blockquote>The leasee is a pleasant elderly hospitable, unmarried, gentleman of a bygone generation, but I should say that he was neither a very practical nor an ardent sheep farmer. He expressed himself as extremely glad to see us but not altogether surprised as he had dreamt that we were coming.</blockquote></blockquote><p>After World War I, Henry Waldron travelled back to England and died there on 11 August 1919, from the effects of a heatwave. An affectionate obituary in the  <em>Falkland Islands Magazine </em>of November 1919 gives a vivid picture of this unusual man, speaking of his skill as a cook, ' <em>a connoisseur and an artist in matters culinary', </em>his fascination with <em> </em>legal texts, ' <em>which he read and studied with engrossing interest',  </em>his belief in homoeopathy,  <em>'he was never happier than when he was able to use his knowledge for the assistance of the sick' </em>and his kindness, ' <em>no one derived more genuine delight from the spending of his money on giving pleasure or assistance to others'.  </em>Allardyce's opinion of Henry Waldron's farming credentials is supported by the obituarist: <em> 'Mr. Henry cared more for the development of his own theories than he did for the amassing of wealth and no one can accuse him of over stocking or failing to improve his land by fencing and by planting grass and tussock. His farm was his hobby'.  </em>In summary, the obituarist recorded that  <em>'the news of his death in England ... was received with universal regret. ...We had all grown to admire his loveable nature, full of generosity, kindliness and originality and we recalled with pride the prominent part played by him in the life of the Colony for over fifty years'. </em></p><p>Though far from the conventional image of a pioneering sheep farmer, Henry Waldron clearly made a great contribution to life in the Falklands in the early days of settlement. In addition to establishing with his brother one of the most notable farms on West Falkland, he successfully put his own less worldly ideas into practice on Beaver Island. He must have brought, to a society necessarily preoccupied with the constant physical struggle for survival, a refreshing breadth of vision, a wider dimension which enriched the life of those around him.</p><p><a href=\"/biographies/terriss_william\">See Image 340</a></p>",

When he was in his thirties he travelled to Australia, New Zealand and South America to find a suitable place to establish a new sheep farm and in August 1866 applied for seven sections of 6,000 acres each on West Falkland. Although this was an application in excess of the amounts allowed by law, Governor <a href=\"/biographies/robinson_sir\">ROBINSON</a> recommended its acceptance, partly to counter-balance the holdings of the FIC. Waldron arrived at Port Howard in September 1867 on the barque  <em>Diana </em>with Exmoor sheep from England and Merinos from Montevideo. Timber buildings arrived in sections (one of which is still standing at Port Howard). James Waldron's notebook for 1866/67 survives, giving insights into some of the difficulties he encountered.</p><p>Although the FIC refused to sell him sheep, his estates prospered. Governor <a href=\"/biographies/darcy_george\">D'ARCY</a> wrote in his Blue Book report of 1872: <em>'The islands are better adapted for sheep rather than for cattle. This discovery was made by Mr.Waldron of the West Falklands and is now universally recognised. </em>'</p><p>In 1876  FE <a href=\"/biographies/cobb_frederick\">COBB</a> reported to the FIC's directors:</p><blockquote><blockquote>mr w has doubtless spent thousands of pounds in starting his place and has a good deal to show for his money, though in my opinion his expenditure had often been lavish and in many instances ill-considered. ...altogether his establishment must be fully worth £200,000.</blockquote></blockquote><p>Governor KERR thought highly of him and suggested him as a possible councillor (though he does not appear to have entered either council). In 1883 Kerr noted that JL Waldron took first place in West Falkland:</p><blockquote><blockquote>unlike most of the other sheep-farmers, who were for the most part adventurers, he embarked a large capital in establishing and stocking his stations; he is a man of large and enlightened views and by his considerate and liberal treatment of his shepherds and labourers he sets an example.</blockquote></blockquote><p>In addition to initial help in establishing Port Howard from his younger brother Henry, James also had the support of his elder brother John, who lived at Port Howard for a time with his wife, Ellen. One of their daughters, Ellen Elizabeth, married Edmund Matthews, who later took over the management of Port Howard. Other members of the Waldron family established successful farms in Patagonia.</p><p>Waldron left the Islands on 8 June 1889, and returned to live at Marridge Hill. He died in Bournemouth on 2 March 1901. He was married to Mary Palmer of Newbury. They had no children. A large fireproof safe in the Cathedral vestry in Stanley is inscribed 'In Memory of JL Waldron from his Widow and Friends'.  Another memorial to Waldron in Christ Church Cathedral reads 'This Tablet is erected by the Employees of Port Howard Station. In Memory of a good and kind employer'. Port Howard remained in family ownership until 1990 and is still run as a successful large farm, one of the few original estates not to have been subdivided.  </p><p>James Waldron brought to the early days of farming on West Falkland a confidence in the future of sheep that proved invaluable. His family background gave him both the experience and the capital necessary to back his judgement. His faith and investment contributed much to the development of the industry.</p>",

He has two brothers, James Hubert Wallace (b1957) and Fraser Barrett Wallace (b1961). Educated in the Falklands schools Wallace started work in 1969 with the Falkland Islands Company as a clerk and has fond memories of the short time he worked with Philip Hutton and John Smith in the 'Works Department' and 'Spares Section'.</p><p>In 1970 he joined the British Antarctic Survey, based in Stanley, as a teleprinter operator and continued to work for BAS until 1974 when Falkland communications, and those with the British bases in Antarctica, were taken over by Cable and Wireless Limited. In 1972 Wallace took an opportunity to live and study in Buenos Aires for six months. At a time when travel for Falkland Islanders was difficult and expensive he thoroughly enjoyed his time there and made friendships which have survived the tumultuous years since.</p><p>Wallace stayed with Cable and Wireless for some months before taking a passage on the British Antarctic Survey vessel <em>John Biscoe </em>to Southampton. For the next year he travelled around Europe and worked for a time in Israel. After returning to the Falklands in 1975 he rejoined Cable and Wireless as a clerk and stayed with them until 1987, becoming part of the management team. He participated in the rebuilding of the Falklands communications infrastructure following the 1982 war and the major developments in Falklands communications which followed.</p><p>On returning to the Falklands in 1975 Wallace became a member of the 'Falkland Islands Committee' and in 1977 he was elected a member of LegCo. A strong critic of the old colonial attitudes and the exploitation that accompanied them, he was at that time said to be the youngest elected politician in the Commonwealth. He has always maintained that this was more a result of a declining Falklands community and so lack of choice for electors than any particular attribute of his. Over the next four years he participated on LegCo, being the first councillor to have regular 'clinics', and also served on ExCo. On two occasions he was part of Falkland delegations sent to meet Minister of State Ted <a href=\"/biographies/rowlands_edward\">ROWLANDS</a> in South America and with another Falkland councillor Adrian <a href=\"/biographies/monk_adrian\">MONK</a> was part of the British team which met with Argentina in 1980. Wallace lost his seat in the elections of 1981.</p><p>In 1983 Wallace became a member of the newly established 'Falkland Islands Development Corporation' and served on this board for the next eight years, a time of significant economic and social progress in the Falklands. The Falklands fishery was established in 1986 and created immediate and unprecedented opportunities for Falkland Islanders. With a colleague from work, John Cheek, Wallace left Cable and Wireless and together they set up one of the first local fishing companies to be entirely owned by Falkland Islanders, Fortuna Limited. After a nerve-racking first few years the company prospered and with a rigorous policy of reinvestment it developed into one of the most economically significant groups of companies in the Islands, with interests in several sectors of the economy and making a major economic contribution to the Falklands' community, an achievement which gave both Cheek and Wallace great pleasure.</p><p>Wallace married Maria Lilian Cárcamo, in 1977: they have a daughter, Fiona (b1977) and a son, James (b1981).</p>",

In Stanley he wrote a letter dated 3 April 1872 (co-signed by 89 resident petitioners - a useful list of the Catholic population at the time) to Governor <a href=\"/biographies/darcy_george\">D'ARCY</a> concerning the plight of Catholics on the Islands. Walsh's visit brought D'Arcy (whose wife was an enthusiastic Catholic) into conflict with the Rev Henry <a href=\"/biographies/lory_henry\">LORY</a>, who arrived in Stanley as a locum, when the colonial chaplain Charles <a href=\"/biographies/bull_charles\">BULL</a> returned to England on holidays.</p><p>Walsh's stay was short; he was the second Catholic priest to reside on the Islands during British rule and was followed in 1875 by Father James <a href=\"/biographies/foran_james\">FORAN</a>. After returning to Buenos Aires, Walsh may have spent some time in Brazil before arriving back in Australia. By 1874 he was in charge of the Valley Parish before being appointed first parish priest of Townsville in 1878.</p>",

After school in Penrith he went to Liverpool University and read engineering; he then took a second degree in agriculture at Aberdeen. He worked in the educational and advisory service in Scotland from 1922 to 1932. In 1930 he married Helann Wyse, and they had three children - Urla, Ann and Ewen. After three years in Northumberland, he returned to Scotland (the North of Scotland College of Agriculture in Aberdeen) and joined the Department of Agriculture for Scotland in January 1948.

'We need a sort of pastoral Billy Graham!' wrote the governor, and through the influence of Sir Anthony <a href=\"/biographies/hurd_anthony\">HURD</a>, Wannop was asked to visit the Falkland Islands and to write a report. He arrived in the  <em>Darwin </em>on 31 October 1960; to tour East and West Falkland, leaving on 12 January 1961. The Wannop Report of 1961 was one of a succession of reports ( <em>e.g.  </em>MUNRO 1924; <a href=\"/biographies/davies_william\">DAVIES</a> 1938; <a href=\"/biographies/gibbs_james\">GIBBS</a> 1946; <a href=\"/biographies/guillebaud_claude\">GUILLEBAUD</a> 1967; ODA 1969; Theophilus 1972; <a href=\"/biographies/shackleton_edward\">SHACKLETON</a> 1976) written between the 1920s and the 1970s about the future of the sheep farming industry of the Islands.</p><p>Wannop's overall assessment revealed a familiar pattern: the total number of sheep appeared to be still declining, though less rapidly than formerly, from the peak of 1898. The sheep husbandry system continued to be extensive grazing - 'an extractive form of farming'. The incentive to improve settlement fields was not great. Wannop clearly understood that the improvement of Camp was a difficult undertaking under the Falkland Islands' climatic and geographical conditions. Although everyone agreed that lime and fertilisers would be beneficial for selected areas of farmland, little was used because of the cost. He pointed to Roy Cove farm as model of what could be achieved, but believed camp improvement was unlikely really to succeed unless combined with some grazing control which meant more fencing. To alternate grazing and rest periods not only prolonged the effectiveness of grazing, but could actually lead to rejuvenation. Wannop concluded by encouraging government to appoint a scientific officer to investigate potential improvements in soil and grassland fertility - a post in due course filled by CD <a href=\"/biographies/young_colin\">YOUNG</a>. After Wannop's departure from the Falkland Islands the  <em>Monthly Review  </em>commented: 'Mr Wannop's visit has been an unqualified success from all points of view. The farmers have been most grateful and appreciative of Mr Wannop's interest in their problems'.</p><p>Wannop retired in 1965; he died at his home in Edinburgh on 11 September 1972.</p>",

He was educated at the City of Bath Boys' School and the School of Navigation at Southampton. In 1946 he became an indentured apprentice to the South American Saint Line and served with them until 1950. It was during this time that he first made the acquaintance of Falkland Islanders and became aware of the dispute with Argentina. The daughter of a family he stayed with in Buenos Aires went to the English school and was taught, in the morning sessions in English, that the Islands were British, while in the afternoon sessions in Spanish, she learnt that the Malvinas were Argentine!</p><p>In 1950 he joined Furness, Withy &amp; Co sailing on North American passenger ships, Prince Line Mediterranean cargo/passenger ships, general traders, ore carriers and west coast of North America cargo liners. In 1971 Furness withdrew from the west coast service, and Warne joined the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) as third officer on the RRS <em>Discovery </em>. In 1973-4 he made his first cruise to the Antarctic and first visit to the Falkland Islands as chief officer on the RRS <em>Shackleton </em>. It was on 4 February 1975, when he was in command of RRS <em>Shackleton </em>87 miles from Stanley that he was intercepted by an Argentine destroyer, the <em>Almirante Storni, </em>and told to sail to Ushuaia in Tierra del Fuego. Warne refused to change course and contacted Governor <a href=\"/biographies/french_neville\">FRENCH</a> by radio. He told the Argentine ship that she might accompany him to Stanley, but the Argentine captain refused and fired three shots across <em>Shackleton </em>'s bows. Warne warned the Argentines that he was carrying explosives and continued on course for Stanley. After firing twice more, the destroyer gave up but kept close to the <em>Shackleton </em>until the Falklands were in sight. The incident marked a sharp increase in Argentine pressure on the Islands but Warne's coolness, ably supported by all on board, had saved the day. He was awarded an OBE in the next New Year's Honours.</p><p>In 1986-1989 he was in command of the RRS <em>Charles Darwin </em>for part of her west to east circumnavigation. He retired from NERC in 1989 and studied at the Open University, obtaining a BSc (Hons) in earth sciences and oceanography. He and his wife also acted as long and short term foster parents to 25 Newcastle teenagers over 15 years - a task he describes as just as challenging as quarrelling with an Argentine destroyer!</p>",

In 1930 she became a certified midwife.</p><p>On 13 October 1933 Mary arrived in the Falkland Islands on the SS <em>Lafonia </em>to take up the post of sister at the hospital, a post she held until her promotion to nurse matron on the 5 July 1935. She resigned from this position in 1937 prior to returning to England to marry Duncan Russell Watson (1880-1959). Her husband was born at Camilla Creek on 16 August 1880. He became a leading light in the volunteer/defence force, serving in World Wars I and II, and rising to the rank of captain. He was adjutant to the FIDF and was awarded the efficiency decoration in 1947.

He then married Mary Hill on 1 April 1937 in Swindon. In later years he suffered a prolonged illness but he survived his wife by one year. On her return to the Falkland Islands after her marriage Mary continued nursing, acting as relief matron. She worked with a specialist on the tuberculosis eradication programme, nursing many victims tirelessly, visiting some twice a day, going in and out in all weathers and at any time day or night on her bicycle. Government eventually provided her with a motorised bike, but she never got the hang of it on the pot-holed roads. She was a skilled, caring and dedicated nurse; nothing was ever too much trouble.

When Captain Watt retired from the Coldstream Guards in 1901 he took his family to the Falkland Islands where he was employed to train the FIVF and act as clerk to the colonial secretary.</p><p>Norman spent his formative years on the Islands being taught at Stanley school where he won a prize which was to change his life. It was a book entitled <em>Under the Double Eagle </em>about old time whaling and it lit a fire which was to burn for the rest of his life. His formal education ended at 13 and at age 17 he became junior clerk to the colonial secretary. One of his jobs was to type government regulations relating to whaling which the colonial secretary Vans <a href=\"/biographies/best_sir\">BEST</a> was drafting. He was a precocious child and would often abscond when the whaling fleets were in harbour, row out to the ships and invite himself onboard. When he returned several hours later he would find the CS angrily waiting for him. He would present his notes made while on the ships and find himself without punishment. It became a regular exercise to visit the whalers and keep the CS updated with what was going on at sea.</p><p>Watt was an accomplished musician, having learnt the violin as a child. He became leader of the FIVF Brass Band and taught himself to play all the instruments so that the band could play in the parades even if a member was ill.</p><p>In 1913 Watt became postal clerk in Stanley. A year later he became deputy collector of customs and deputy postmaster at the new whaling station on New Island. In 1915 Watt was instructed to sail to Stanley and help in its defence. This he promptly did and then tried several times to get permission to return to England. He finally took passage on a passing whaler but was unable to say goodbye to his friends lest the authorities remove him from the ship.</p><p>Once in England he joined the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve as a pilot in the RNAS. He was an undistinguished pilot and his service record states that he suffered from 'air sickness'. Family legend has it that he flew a plane which was still under repair and survived the consequent crash with only a concussion. He was nursed by Dorothy Reid who was to become his wife. They married in 1917 and had two sons, Peter, (b1919) and Paul, (b1921).</p><p>In November 1919 he started working as a manager for the Southern Whaling and Sealing Company, which was taken over by Lever Brothers that same year. Based in Cheshire, he would accompany the whaling vessels to the Falklands every few years to keep abreast of changes in the industry. He continued to work for Unilever until his retirement in August 1940, having risen to the position of Shipping Director.</p><p>After World War II he farmed in Sussex raising Ayrshire cattle. At the end of the 1950's he retired and both he and Dorothy moved in with their youngest son Paul in Gillingham, Kent. There they lived out the rest of their days; Watt died in March 1961 and his wife in August 1966.</p>",

        "body": "<p>sealer and explorer, appears to have been born either in Ostend, Belgium or Massachusetts, the son of an upholsterer by trade, who migrated from his native Lanarkshire to London and his wife Sarah, née Pease. James joined the Royal Navy as a boy and took part in convoy duties during the French wars and the War of 1812-1814*. He was appointed master, Royal Navy, on 21 October 1815. One of his superior officers, Captain Hector Duff, testified to his ability as a good seaman, particularly fond of navigation, and unusually accurate in his calculation of longitude by lunar observations. His next captain, the Hon Robert Cavendish Spencer, commended him as a 'steady, trustworthy, deserving officer, who I had no fault whatever to find with', to be recommended 'as both an officer and gentleman'.</p><p>Weddell is celebrated in polar history for his voyage of 1822-1824 during which he penetrated the then unknown Weddell Sea as far as lat 74°15'S in the brig <em>Jane </em>, 160 tons, of Leith, and the cutter <em>Beaufoy </em>, 65 tons, of London. The voyage was to procure fur seal skins, the <em>Jane </em>being commanded by Weddell himself, with a complement of twenty-two officers and men, while the cutter, with a complement of thirteen, was commanded by Matthew <a href=\"/biographies/brisbane_matthew\">BRISBANE</a>. The vessels were provisioned for two years. Weddell tells us that he had already spent five years navigating these southern waters, including the neighbourhood of Cape Horn, presumably also in search of Fur Seals.</p><p>His voyage is remarkable in various ways. One of the seals brought aboard the <em>Jane </em>in January 1823 was new to Weddell; and its skull and skin, still housed in the basement of Edinburgh's Royal Scottish Museum, became the type specimen for <em>Leptonychotes weddelli </em>, the Weddell Seal. His high latitude south compares with that of Captain <a href=\"/biographies/cook_james\">COOK</a> (71°10'S) in a different longitude of the Southern Ocean. The event is portrayed in WJ Huggins' painting of the brig <em>Jane </em>and cutter <em>Beaufoy, </em>20 February 1823, bearing up in 74°15' (this being the highest southern latitude ever reached). Weddell called his discovery after King George, but it was renamed after Weddell himself. Although not fitted out as well as the official naval voyages of exploration of the time, Weddell had three reliable chronometers and several compasses. There was of course no indication that he would attain such a notable southern latitude when departing from London. In the introduction to his book, he tells us that it was the solicitations of his owners and his friends that led him to publish this, instead of merely sending an official letter to the Admiralty summarising those interesting 'foreign and unknown matters' contained in his notes.</p><p>Such was the success of his narrative that two editions were called for, the second, of 1827, was fuller than the first, of 1825. Here is the full title:</p><p><em>A voyage towards the South Pole performed in the years 1822 - 24 containing an examination of the Antarctic Sea to the seventy-fourth degree of latitude and a visit to Tierra del Fuego, with a particular account of the inhabitants to which is added much useful information on the coasting navigation of Cape Horn and the adjacent lands, with charts of harbours, &amp;c. . . </em></p><p>The second edition also contained 'observations on the probability of reaching the South Pole', as well as 'an account of the second voyage performed by the Beaufoy, Captain Brisbane, to the same seas'. The Falkland Islands may be counted among the 'adjacent lands'. The book, with other fine charts, plates, nautical tables, folding views, and a detailed text, is the extraordinary result of what the author called on the first page: 'Our adventure for procuring Fur-seal skins'. Among the folding charts is a 'Chart of Berkeley's Sound in the Falkland Islands', showing Port Louis, Hog Island and the 'French wreck' (the <em>Uranie </em>), beds of kelp and some soundings.</p><p>Weddell devotes chapter IV of his <em>Voyage </em>to the Falkland Islands, where the vessels wintered at an anchorage in Quaker Harbour, Swan Island, from 11 May to 7 October 1823, having first come to anchor at New Island. The brig's topmasts were struck and the vessel made secure against any heavy gales, while the cutter was kept ready 'for the purpose of pursuing our business'. Each man's allowance was reduced, but supplemented by whatever could be procured ashore. Weddell wintered twice among the Falklands and visited nearly all their harbours, so that his pages relating to them are authoritative. The chapter is mainly taken up with remarks useful to future mariners, not unlike sailing directions. However, Weddell also describes his dealings with Commodore <a href=\"/biographies/freycinet_louis-claude\">FREYCINET</a> and his vivacious wife after the wreck of the <em>Uranie </em>in 1820. Later in the same year, Weddell also had dealings in Port Louis with a Captain <a href=\"/biographies/jewett_david\">JEWETT</a>, who took possession of the Islands in the name of the 'supreme government of the United Provinces of South America' {Argentina}. Weddell was able to combat the appalling outbreak of scurvy in Jewitt's crew from his knowledge of the use of 'fish, wild fowl and other vegetables'.</p><p>During a subsequent and brief visit to the Falkland Islands in February and March 1824, Weddell anchored in Robertson's Bay, then in Ship Harbour, at New Island and in West Point Harbour. At Port Egmont, a Spanish ship of the line the <em>Asia </em>, 70 guns, accompanied by the <em>Achilles </em>, 20 guns, lay anchored, much to Weddell's surprise. He dined aboard the <em>Asia </em>, where he examined the Spanish charts and also visited the brig. Shooting parties decimated the birds of the neighbourhood. The <em>Jane </em>and the <em>Beaufoy </em>returned to England 59 days after leaving Montevideo on 4 May 1824.</p><p>Weddell's portrait was painted by PG Dodd as a miniature, and copied by F Peake for the Royal Geographical Society, much enlarged. Like John <a href=\"/biographies/biscoe_john\">BISCOE</a>, Weddell suffered ill health during his later years, as well as great misfortune. In July 1829, while returning from a trading mission to Buenos Aires, his vessel the <em>Jane </em>was condemned as unseaworthy at Fayal in the Azores. He and the crew continued the voyage as passengers in the schooner <em>Swallow </em>, which was wrecked off the nearby island of Pico. By lashing himself to a rock, Weddell's life was saved, but he lost valuable papers, besides 'a quantity of specie' (coin). Some months later, as master of the merchant ship <em>Eliza,  </em>owned by Messrs Asquith, Weddell spent nine, presumably fruitless, months in harbour at Hobart from May 1831 to January 1832, during which time he helped by chance to moor John Biscoe's <em>Tula </em>after his discovery of Enderby Land.</p><p>PG Dodd, who painted the miniature later wrote of Weddell:</p><blockquote><blockquote>In deportment very tall, large and bulky, with full face made up of bold features - complexion dark, full of warm glowing tone, his hair very black - energy and character, remarkably prominent in his eyebrows, common only to such men of enterprise or courage. During his sittings, his conversation was most instructive - portraying lively images of persons and things as seen by him abroad. Himself a tolerable draftsman he not only wrote a very scientific and popular work but gave to the graphic art a colouring of human as well as animal nature, discovered by him in his expedition. He possessed fortitude of character as one anecdote will evince - namely, once when shipwrecked and on a rock expecting the next wave to wash him off, he drew from his pocket his favourite author, always his companion, and philosophised under an almost insurmountable state of feeling. In private life he was easy, animated and cheerful - but when seen alone and unconscious of being seen, there was an appearance of melancholy seated upon his manly features indicating that he had experienced disappointments common to all - but with this difference only more intense from the refinements of his own character. He, like many others, struggled to advance great ends by most inadequate means, felt he was not encouraged, was ruined in pocket, broken in spirit and died, leaving to mankind a memorial of worth which fixes but to a lake, a sympathy and a name.</blockquote></blockquote><p>Weddell died penniless in Norfolk Street, off the Strand, London on 9 September 1834. He is remembered by Weddell Island (formerly Swan Island) in the Falklands and by the Weddell Sea in the Antarctic.</p>",

        "body": "<p>Dutch sea captain. Although one of the earliest European navigators to sight the Falkland Islands, comparatively little is known about de Weert, apart from his role in one of several early endeavours to sail westwards from Holland in order to establish a trading route to the Dutch East Indies {Indonesia}.</p><p>The expedition in which de Weert sailed was organised at the end of the sixteenth century by two Rotterdam merchants, Johan van der Veken and Pieter van der Hagen. Five ships with a total complement of almost five hundred men set off to reach the Pacific by sailing through the Magellan Strait. This was a major undertaking and heavy armaments were taken for protection. The flotilla left the Dutch north coast on 27 June 1598. The ships were the  <em>Geloof </em>(Faith)  <em>Hoop </em>(Hope),  <em>Liefde </em>(Charity) the  <em>Trouwe </em>(Fidelity) and the  <em>Blijde Boodschap </em>(Glad Tidings), the last commanded by Sebald de Weert.</p><p>Before the fleet even reached Brazil, many sailors had died of scurvy, including Jacques Mahu, the expedition's leader and the survivors were forced to land on the African coast to combat the disease. Simon de Cordes, commander of the  <em>Liefde, </em>became admiral in Mahu's place and in 1599 the crossing of the Atlantic began. At the eastern entrance of the Magellan Strait the expedition was halted for four months because of unfavourable winds. There were fights with local Indians. Penguins were slaughtered for food, on one occasion 1,400 in a day and a further 120 men died.</p><p>Finally the Pacific was reached in September 1599, but the ships lost contact with each other in a storm. The  <em>Trouwe  </em>and the  <em>Geloof, </em>the latter now commanded by Sebald de Weert, were blown back to the entrance of the Strait. Then they too lost contact with one other and their crews threatened mutiny. Amazingly, at this point de Weert's ship encountered another Dutch expedition led by Olivier van Noort with similar aims, which had set out a year later. But de Weert's compatriots could not assist him. Provisions on van Noort's ships were also running low and de Weert was shown an empty bread chest. Because his men were so weak and the hull of the  <em>Geloof </em>was so heavily encrusted with barnacles, it was clear he could not even keep up with Van Noort and had no option but to limp back to Holland.</p><p>On 18 January 1600, after landing to gather penguins to salt for food, they lost their anchor and only just managed to get on board the  <em>Geloof, </em>losing their boat as well. On the morning of 24 January 1600 de Weert spotted  <em>'drie kleine eylandkens' </em>(three little islets) which appear to have been the Jason Islands, north-west of the Falklands. The ship's journal recorded: 'We found three small islets to windward, not marked in any maps, which we named the Sebaldine Islands. These are in lat. 50 deg. 40'S., sixty leagues from the continent, and contained abundance of penguins; but we could not catch any, having no boat'. <em> </em>As landing was impossible, the crew had to survive on their existing supplies. Daily rations now consisted of one quarter pound of bread and a half a penguin. Early in February one of the few seamen still strong enough to operate the ship broke into the stores, drank wine and ate uncooked rice. He was condemned to be hanged but so desperate was their need for able bodied crew that he was pardoned. Two days later he again stole from the stores and this time he was hanged and his body thrown into the sea. Finally after much further suffering, the  <em>Geloof </em>reached European waters in July, with only a third of the original crew still alive. After a failed attempt to buy an anchor in Dover to help navigate the dangerous shallows of the Dutch coast, she returned at last to Holland, the only ship of the expedition to do so.</p><p>The  <em>Trouwe </em>, the  <em>Hoop </em>and the  <em>Blijde Boodschap </em>were lost after various misadventures, including clashes with both Indians and Spaniards along the Chilean coast. The  <em>Liefde </em>, with a depleted crew, finally reached Japan, where the captain and crew were arrested by the authorities. One of the sailors, an Englishman named William Adams, managed to gain the confidence of the Shogun ruler, Iyeyaso and not only obtained freedom for his shipmates, but was able to establish a Dutch trading post in a land otherwise completely closed to foreigners. (The story has been told in the novel  <em>Shogun </em>by James Clavell and a replica of the  <em>Liefde </em>is today on display in Japan.)</p><p>Back in Holland, de Weert wrote his account of the expedition. Happy to be alive, although with two thirds of his crew lost, he thanked God for his safe return. However the enterprise was hardly a success and no portrait of him is known to exist. His seafaring skills were recognised by his promotion to vice-admiral, but he was killed in Ceylon {Sri Lanka} on his next voyage in 1603, after the king believed that de Weert had insulted him. He may have been judged a failure by his contemporaries, but the work of the  <em>Geloof </em>greatly contributed to the description and mapping of the Magellan Strait. De Weert's story, like those of so many other mariners in the Southern Ocean, is a remarkable tale of skill, courage and endurance. For over a hundred and fifty years after his voyage, the <em>'drie kleine eylandkens'  </em>he longed to land on, bore his name, being known as the Isles of Sebald de Weert or the Sebaldines, until, in 1766, Captain John McBRIDE, in the  <em>Jason </em>, gave them the name they are known by today.</p>",

He was a volunteer during the Boer War in 1901. Weller spent the following years in the USA and Canada until 1910, when he attended Selwyn College, Cambridge, graduating in 1913 (BA). He was ordained in Ely Cathedral in 1913, and went out to serve in Delhi with the Cambridge University Mission. Then from 1914 to 1916 he was a railway chaplain at Lahore, and in 1917, chaplain in Waziristan. In 1917-18, as a temporary chaplain to the Forces, Weller served as divisional chaplain in the 3rd Lahore Division in Mesopotamia, Egypt and Palestine, and then as divisional chaplain, 4th Quetta Division in Afganistan in 1919.</p><p>Weller married Alexina Caley in 1916. There were no children of the marriage and she died in 1934.</p><p>Back in civilian life, Weller became chaplain in Quetta until 1920, and then moved to Melbourne, Australia. He became Mission to Seamen chaplain there from 1923 to 1929, and superintendent of the Mission for a further year. Moving back to England, he was appointed chaplain and superintendent of the Mersey Mission between 1930 and 1934, when he was nominated as the next bishop of the Falkland Islands.</p><p>He was consecrated bishop in Southwark Cathedral on 29 June 1934, having the same jurisdiction as his predecessor, Bishop DE <a href=\"/biographies/jersey_norman\">JERSEY</a> and again based in Valparaiso.

He continued to have the supervision of his former diocese of the Falkland Islands. Shortly after, he became seriously ill, and returned to England to recuperate. He was nursed back to health by Frances M Butler, whom he married in 1938, and by her had a son and a daughter. After an absence of 11 months from South America, the Wellers returned. He remained bishop throughout the war years resigning in 1946.</p><p>Back in England, Weller was appointed vicar of Edwalton, Notts and also appointed assistant bishop of Southwell from 1946 to 1952.

        "body": " <p>merchant and colonial promoter, was baptised on 22 June 1808 in Merrow, Surrey, the son of Peter Whitington of Whitmore Hall, Guildford. As a merchant he was involved in the Australian trade and seems in the late 1830s to have sailed home via the Falkland Islands. He was linked to Captain <a href=\"/biographies/langdon_william\">LANGDON</a> RN, who had received a grant of land from Louis <a href=\"/biographies/vernet_louis\">VERNET</a>. Langdon sold his land - ten square miles - to Whitington in 1833 for £500 and in December 1833 the latter wrote to Vernet seeking his confirmation, which he received. The following year Whitington wrote again to Vernet to inform him of the proposed foundation of a Falkland Islands Association and offering to arrange the transfer of Vernet's property and rights to the new British administration; the Association soon foundered.</p><p>He started writing to the Colonial Office in 1834 urging colonisation and at one stage threatening to sell his rights to the US Government. In 1835 Whitington was declared bankrupt. In October 1839, Lord John Russell, secretary of state, told Whitington that HMG had no intention of moving to colonise the Islands. In 1840 Whitington founded the Falkland Islands Commercial Fishery and Agricultural Association, and advertised in several newspapers. In April 1840 he wrote to the Secretary of State proposing colonisation by the FICFAA. He also published his booklet of 82 pages on <em>The Falkland Islands etc. compiled from ten years investigation of the subject </em>, drawing largely on the most optimistic phrases from the reports and accounts of naval officers and other visitors. This was followed by a petition to government signed by 100 city merchants proposing a public meeting on colonisation of the Islands. In May 1840, following a succession of letters from Whitington, Lord John Russell declared that HMG was 'desirous of colonising' the Islands and instructed officials to report on the best way of doing so.</p><p>In October 1840, George Whitington sent his 23 year old brother John Bull <a href=\"/biographies/whitington_john\">WHITINGTON</a> out to the Falklands with a party of emigrants and livestock in two ships which he owned - the <em>Mary Ann </em>and the <em>Susan </em>: he claimed the expedition cost him £10,000. The party arrived in January 1841. When Richard <a href=\"/biographies/moody_richard\">MOODY</a> was appointed lieutenant-governor in August 1841, Whitington was very pressing that Moody and his party should travel out in his brig <em>Alarm </em>. The papers suggest that Whitington may have offered him a corrupt kickback, but Moody declined. In March 1842, Whitington brought a case in the Irish Court of Admiralty at Cork against John Hartnell who had captained the <em>Mary Ann </em>in 1840. Hartnell was accused of making off with the ship's cargo in Port Louis and of taking illegal possession of the ship. Also in 1842 a report from the <em>Times </em>was forwarded to the Colonial Office giving details of a civil dispute concerning Whitington who was found guilty of having taken improper salvage of the ship <em>Quail </em>in Australia. The following year Whitington was again declared bankrupt and accused of sending threatening letters to city merchants. There was, the <em>Times </em>reported, 'general hilarity in court' when Whitington maintained that he had been granted land in the Falklands worth £200,000 by the Buenos Aires government</p><p>From that stage on, the Colonial Office handled Whitington with even more reserve. In May 1845 an official noted on a letter seeking an interview: 'the writer does not bear at all a high character' and recommended that the secretary of state should not receive him. In May 1848 he was again turned down and told to put his request in writing. In 1852 he wrote two offensive letters to the junior minister and an official minuted: 'Mr Whitington has always been known to be anything but a respectable person'. He also wrote bitter letters to Louis Vernet who was visiting London. In October 1859, Whitington wrote to the foreign secretary, Lord John Russell, on 'The Malvinas or Falklands' but was again brushed off.</p><p>He drops out of the record at that stage. Clearly of doubtful morality, he did at least organise the first non-official British colonisation of the Islands.</p>",

        "body": " <p>colonist, was baptised on 12 July 1817 at West Clandon, Surrey, the fourth son of Peter Whitington of Whitmore Hall, Guildford. He was trained as a chemist. In October 1840 funded by his brother George T <a href=\"/biographies/whitington_george\">WHITINGTON</a>, he left for the Falkland Islands in two of his brother's brigs, the <em>Susan  </em>and the  <em>Mary Ann </em>, with a party of 16 colonists, two children, 12 sheep and two pigs. He intended to settle there and take over the land purchased by his brother from Captain <a href=\"/biographies/langdon_william\">LANGDON</a> (who had been granted it by VERNET).</p><p>In January 1841 the party arrived. The enterprise got off to a bad start when the master of the  <em>Mary Ann </em>, John Hartnell, took possession of her provisions and proceeded to sell them off to the colonists and visiting sailors. He later made off with the ship. Whitington asked the naval officer commanding, Lt <a href=\"/biographies/tyssen_john\">TYSSEN</a>, for 'quiet possession' of his brother's land. Thyssen replied that he had no authority to put Whitington in possession of such lands. Notwithstanding, Whitington built 'Falkland House', presumably from material brought out from England, and established a fish salting plant. He employed ten people under a foreman WH DEAN. The fish salting appears to have failed; Whitington promoted some sealing, farmed the sheep and purchased cattle hides. In June 1841 Capt <a href=\"/biographies/onslow_john\">ONSLOW</a> wrote to the Secretary of State that Whitington 'gives cheering accounts of the settlers and the climate, but unsatisfactory as regards the conduct of some of the people and the sailors arising from the absence of any regular government'.</p><p>Regular government arrived in the form of Lieutenant-Governor Richard <a href=\"/biographies/moody_richard\">MOODY</a> in January 1842. When Moody wrote his major report in April he noted: 'the few sheep are in very fine condition especially some Leicesters and Southdowns belonging to Mr JB Whitington (a settler) which are in remarkably good order with long heavy fleeces'. But relations with Moody soon soured: in November Moody protested over Whitington's treatment of his employees, John Batchelor and his wife. Moody referred to the matter in a despatch which was printed in London: though Whitington was not named it must have been clear that he was the harsh employer referred to. The move of the seat of government to Stanley meant that Whitington was left with land of little value at Port Louis. Moody refused to refund the price of this land and told London: 'I have often expressed to Mr Whitington and others that we were doing nothing for our own maintenance and that I wished him to set an example in doing something beyond selling goods'. Whitington had implied that he would use 'other sources' (presumably in England) to obtain his rights. The bad feeling smoulders on in the official papers until almost the end of Moody's term. In June 1846 Moody wrote that Whitington headed 'a small party who are in constant opposition to the Govt. and who, too indolent or too indifferent to labour personally to maintain themselves, appear to be striving to make all around them as discontented and disaffected as themselves'.</p><p>But in November 1847 Whitington was appointed a JP and the following month he was made a cornet (second lieutenant) in the militia cavalry which Moody had formed. He was appointed to LegCo just before Moody was transferred in July 1848.</p><p>Whitington had remained in Port Louis after the general move to Stanley, but in 1849 he too moved to the new town and rented a large slice of land out to Cape Pembroke for grazing of milk and beef cattle. He became a keen rival to Captain <a href=\"/biographies/packe_robert1\">PACKE</a> for the supply of beef to ships' crews.</p><p>When Whitington arrived in the Islands he was accompanied by Sarah, née Hollamby, apparently his wife, who seems to have enjoyed poor health. In June 1842 Moody reported that only the presence of the James Clarke <a href=\"/biographies/ross_sir\">ROSS</a> expedition with its naval doctors had saved the wife of 'a most respectable settler'. But their marriage on 16 September 1845 is reported in the  <em>Times </em>to have taken place in Woking, Surrey, so they must have returned to England to regularise matters. Sarah had at least four sons: Stanley (b1846), Falkland (b1848), Anson (b1849) and Leicester (b1853). But none survived - a finely cut memorial stone in Stanley graveyard notes their deaths but does not name them. Whitington bitterly criticised the Rev James <a href=\"/biographies/moody_james\">MOODY</a> for failing to ride to Port Louis to bury one of his children, when the Chaplain was examined by ExCo in April 1852.</p><p>In 1853 he was replaced on LegCo by JP <a href=\"/biographies/dale_john\">DALE</a>; his remaining son died in October 1853 and he must have left the colony shortly thereafter. In the 1881 English census he appears in Nelson Street, Liverpool living with his wife in a house shared with two other families. He entered his profession as 'gentleman' but the enumerator has crossed this out and written in 'wholesale chemist'.</p><p>Whitington was not helped by his brother's pretensions and shady reputation, but he made a fair start as a colonist and might have achieved more if he had got on with Moody.</p>",

        "body": " <p>merchant, was born in Stanley on 21 June 1869, the third child of Carlos Guilherme from the Azores, who had settled in the Falklands in the early 1860s. Guilherme was naturalised in 1867 and anglicised his name to Charles Williams, working as a tailor and publican in Stanley. Louis' mother was Catherine Carey an Irish widow, née McDonald, who married his father at Holy Trinity Church, Stanley on 7 March 1871. She went on to have four more children by Charles Williams, so Louis grew up with six brothers and sisters and two half brothers, children of Catherine Carey's earlier life. In 1884 Louis' older brother John was drowned, so Louis became the heir to his father's business, which now included a public house on Ross Road, the Esperanza Hotel. Later Charles Williams opened the Globe Hotel and Store and by 1891, owned, in addition to his business premises, no less than seven houses in Stanley. In 1893 the Globe Hotel transferred from John Street to its present site on the corner of Crozier Place and Philomel Hill.</p><p>Charles Williams also began to investigate business opportunities in Patagonia and in 1893 the second of his four daughters, Mary Julia, married Walter Curtze, a German shipping agent for the Kosmos line who lived in Punta Arenas. Curtze helped his father-in-law establish an estancia near Río Gallegos and Louis Williams was increasingly left to manage the family business in the Falklands. He traded successfully and became a prominent member of Stanley society. He was made a JP in 1903 and Governor <a href=\"/biographies/allardyce_sir\">ALLARDYCE</a> considered selecting him for LegCo in May 1906: 'Mr Williams is a comparatively young man with a considerable amount of energy and enterprise for this country...and [has] shown himself to be distinctly public spirited. He is bound to come later'. Williams did indeed become a member of LegCo in 1908 and was made a member of ExCo in March 1913. His father Charles Williams had died in Patagonia in 1907, leaving Louis Williams in sole charge of the Falklands business. On 8 August 1912 he married Ada Majorie Bossingham at the Brompton Oratory in London and they returned to live at Waverley House in Stanley, the Williams family home on the corner of John Street and Philomel Hill.</p><p>Less than eighteen months after his marriage, Louis Williams was killed in a tragic accident. On 20 November 1913, he was travelling to Kidney Island in the steam launch <em>Penguin </em>on an outing with his wife and a number of friends. One of them was William James Roper, the government chief clerk, whose loaded Winchester rifle had been laid on the hatchway. The gun went off and the bullet hit Williams. The launch immediately returned to Stanley and an operation successfully removed the bullet, but Louis Williams died that same evening, aged only 44. An inquest held the following day returned a verdict of accidental death. The  <em>Church Magazine </em>described his funeral, which took place on 25 November at St Mary's and was conducted by Father <a href=\"/biographies/migone_mario\">MIGONE</a>.</p><blockquote><blockquote>The general work in Stanley was closed down for the half day, both the Government and Company issuing orders that no labour was to be done. The funeral party left the house shortly after 3 and was one of the very largest processions ever seen in Stanley. Amongst those present, together with immediate relations, were His Excellency the Administrator [JQ <a href=\"/biographies/dickson_john\">DICKSON]</a>, the Volunteers, the Stanley Benefit Club and the Stanley troop of BP Scouts, together with the children of St. Mary's School........ there was also a very large crowd of sympathisers. ....... The terrible tragedy cast a very deep gloom over the city of Stanley. It seems even now almost impossible to realise that we shall never see again amongst us the mortal form of him whom everyone respected.</blockquote></blockquote><p>Allardyce, who was away on leave at the time of the accident, commented bitterly on his return that Roper seemed unaware of the damage he had done, causing a real loss to the colony of a successful business man who would have invested his profits in Stanley, not remitted them to the UK.</p><p>Louis Williams and his wife had no children. Louis' only surviving brother, Joseph, had died in Patagonia in 1903 and his four sisters were all married and lived abroad. So his widow was left with the ownership of his estate. She arranged for a local manager and returned for a time to her family in England, but when it became clear that the business was not going well, she travelled back to the Falklands. After consulting her late husband's relatives in Chile, she appointed a young Anglo-Argentine accountant, Ernesto <a href=\"/biographies/rowe_ernesto\">ROWE</a> to take charge of running the business of Estate Louis Williams in Stanley. The company, whose name was never changed, flourished under Rowe's management. Centred on the Globe Store in Stanley, it became a mainstay of Falklands commercial life and remained so until Rowe's death in 1975 and the destruction of the Globe Store by fire in 1982. Although Louis Williams sadly died before his potential to contribute to the community could be fully realised, his name remained associated with integrity and commercial success in the Falklands for the rest of the twentieth century.</p>",

Two schooners, <em>Vigilante </em>and <em>Paloma </em>, brought Williams and his party from Montevideo to the Islands, arriving on 22 November 1846. Government made some supplies available to him in January and in May 1847 Governor <a href=\"/biographies/moody_richard\">MOODY</a> appointed him to LegCo and made him a Justice of the Peace. But irritation soon crept into their relations as Moody complained that Williams was not supplying the meat to government and shipping which he was contracted to deliver. Williams also dismissed his workforce when times were slack, leaving them to beg subsistence and a passage home from government. In June 1848 Moody reluctantly granted him two additional 'stations' north of the Darwin isthmus in place of the four Williams had demanded.</p><p>Matters did not improve when Governor <a href=\"/biographies/rennie_george\">RENNIE</a> took over in July 1848. In 1851 the Governor reported that on his return from Montevideo in October 1850, Williams boasted that he would act as he liked regarding SF LAFONE's contract and was resolved that government should exercise no control over him. Williams had landed 80 Spaniards and Indians from Montevideo directly at Lafone's stations in Camp, infringing the Aliens Act; he had refused to move a wrecked cutter which was blocking the new slipway; and he had asked the governor for the loan of a few hundred pounds in order to buy goods from a wrecked French ship. Rennie also criticised Samuel Lafone's failure to visit his estates and the dominance which Williams/Lafone enjoyed over other businesses. But Rennie denied that he had ever called Williams a 'sneaking contemptible scoundrel'.</p><p>The census of 1851 gives Williams' age as 32 and shows him accompanied by a wife and five children, one of them adopted. In July of 1852, JP <a href=\"/biographies/dale_john\">DALE</a> arrived to replace Williams,  having been appointed by the board of the newly-formed Falkland Islands Company Limited which took over Lafone's interests in the Islands.  In November 1852 a note in the Hope Place account book shows the sum of  seventeen shillings and four pence as 'Received from Mr.Williams. Cash in hand on giving possession to Mr.Dale'. So it seems as if there was a handover period of some four months, after which Williams drops out of Falklands history. He was followed by a final blast from Rennie to the Colonial Office. Williams, said the governor, was one who would:</p><blockquote><blockquote>Degrade a British colony to the barbarism of the provinces of the River Plate and to have the few British subjects swamped by importation of disorderly vagabonds, Indians and Spaniards - thrown on the Government whenever it was inconvenient to employ them, to restrict as far as it lay in his power the diet of all the English subjects as well as aliens to bull beef and biscuit; in short to make the Falkland Islands one enormous cattle farm for the exclusive benefit of his employer and cause its inhabitants to live from hand to mouth on the truck system in turf huts scarcely fit for pig sties, whilst he habitually violates the laws and ordinances of the colony.</blockquote></blockquote><p>Friction between governors and managers of the FIC was to become endemic during much of the colony's history. Williams was clearly rougher and tougher than most managers, but he at least got the operation up and running.</p>",

He was enrolled in government service on the same day as a travelling teacher. His first appointment was to a large area of West Falklands, including Port Stephens, Port Edgar, Weddell Island, Beaver Island and New Island. Wilson came back into Stanley during March 1908 and was appointed acting government schoolmaster.</p><p>Wilson took an active part in the social life of Stanley; he was appointed to the Library Committee; he contributed to the funds of the Horticultural Society and also to the Museum. He sang in local concerts and in September 1909 he played the part of Mr Moggridge in <em>Sarah's Young Man </em>at the Assembly Rooms.</p><p>Governor <a href=\"/biographies/allardyce_sir\">ALLARDYCE</a> was impressed by Wilson's ability and sent him to administer South Georgia and its developing Elephant Sealing industry. Wilson was appointed as the first stipendiary magistrate, and he arrived at South Georgia on 30 November 1909 on board the <em>Coronda. </em>On 4 December 1909 a Post Office was opened on South Georgia, with Wilson as the first postmaster. He inspected all the whaling stations during December 1909 while travelling in the <em>Undine </em>, and he conducted the first census of South Georgia. (South Georgia's population was then 720; 93% of whom were Scandinavian)</p><p>Wilson's despatches and memoranda to Governor Allardyce reveal a careful and methodical man - well suited to the administration of a burgeoning industry far from the centre of government. His descriptions of the coastline and the locations of Fur and Elephant Seal rookeries are precise and informative. Wilson quickly realised that although the Fur Seal stocks had not recovered from the nineteenth century exploitation, the Elephant Seal stock had recovered sufficiently to enable controlled exploitation. It was Wilson who devised the pattern of dividing the coastline of South Georgia into four divisions to be used by the sealers in strict rotation to conserve the stocks. The sealing quotas that he established proved remarkably accurate; the 6,000 annual quota which Wilson established remained unchanged until exploitation ceased in 1964, except between 1947-52 when it was unwisely increased.</p><p>Allardyce and Wilson held the view that 'a viable long term operation could only occur if stock conservation legislation was enacted and enforced'. Allardyce sent a confidential despatch to Wilson asking for any information about the whaling and sealing operations of foreign vessels along the coast of South Georgia. But he warned Wilson that any action he might take under the Seal Fisheries (Dependencies) Ordinance 1909 'would require the greatest circumspection'.</p><p>Wilson also made a significant contribution to the management and conservation of whale stocks. By 1910 seventeen whaler-catchers were working in South Georgia waters, and all the companies except one continued whaling operations throughout the winter. There were six shore stations and seven floating factories. Wilson's appointment was a major element in Governor Allardyce's attempts to control and restrict whaling.</p><p>Once reporting to Allardyce, Wilson used the memorable phrase 'the Whaler's El Dorado.' South Georgia, he wrote, 'is in truth the whaler's El Dorado, and like most such places, the hunter's expectations are far from moderate'. Wilson clearly understood the realities of the whaling industry. He wrote on 8 April 1912 to Allardyce:</p><blockquote><blockquote>There is no discrimination amongst the whalers even when they know the difference of sex. And females with a newly born or young calf are deliberately hunted down and usually fall an easy prey to the hunter. The whaler knows well that the mother whale will not travel very fast owing to her calf which she seldom, if ever, leaves, and he frequently takes advantage of this knowledge to kill the young calf first, not for its value which is practically nil, but in order that he may more easily capture the mother. When the young whale is killed the poor mother lingers alongside the vessel, and soon meets with the same fate of her offspring. Such deliberate killing of mother and calf is of common occurrence.</blockquote></blockquote><p>Wilson's work was much admired at the Colonial Office: in 1916, the Secretary of State, Bonar Law minuted on Wilson's last report from South Georgia: 'My great appreciation of this very interesting report, and the accompanying notes on Blue, Fin, Humpback and Sei whales'.</p><p>Wilson drew a number of the early sketch maps of the coastline of South Georgia; his precise drawings show much detail including location of navigation lights, major hazards and the position of the whaling stations. These drawing are now lodged in the Admiralty Hydrographic Office, Taunton.</p><p>Wilson probably went on home leave in 1912 where he married Jean Robertson, who was born near Aberdeen on 23 February 1882. They had one son, Arnold James, born c1913.</p><p>In 1914 Wilson was succeeded by Edward <a href=\"/biographies/binnie_edward\">BINNIE</a> as stipendiary magistrate of South Georgia, and then probably returned to the UK where he seems to have collected his wife and infant son. In May 1915 the family arrived back in the Falkland Islands, and Wilson was appointed stipendiary magistrate of West Falkland, based at Fox Bay. During this time Wilson also served as Falkland Islands Dependencies administrator on Deception Island for the summer seasons of 1915-1916 and 1916-1917. He travelled extensively and collected geological specimens from the Antarctic archipelago, Trinity Island and the South Shetland Islands.</p><p>On 30 July 1918 Wilson resigned from government service; the <em>Church Magazine </em>on July 1918 reported:</p><blockquote><blockquote>Mr J. Innes Wilson, after fifteen years in Government service, has resigned. During these years Mr Wilson has acted in many capacities and this has enabled him to gain a wide knowledge of the Falkland Islands and dependencies. During the last three years he has been Stipendiary Magistrate on the West Falklands, where by his tact and unfailing courtesy he has won general esteem.</blockquote></blockquote><p>Wilson was appointed manager of Fox Bay East sheep farm, and on 1 October 1918 he was appointed a JP. He continued to manage the farm until November 1924. The Wilson family finally returned to the UK in December 1924. The <em>Church Magazine  </em>of December 1924 commented:</p><blockquote><blockquote>Mr and Mrs J. Innes Wilson left the Colony in RMS <em>Ortega </em>and are not likely to be returning. Mr Wilson had a fine record during the years he was in the Government Service. Subsequently as Manager of Fox Bay E, Mr Wilson proved an enthusiastic and successful farmer.</blockquote></blockquote><p>Wilson Harbour (54°07'S 34°41'W) between Kade Point and Cape Demidov on South Georgia was probably named after Wilson who first prepared sketch maps of this area in 1912.</p>",

        "body": "<p>naval officer, 9th baronet, came from a line of naval officers, confusingly all baronets, all admirals and all called William Wiseman.  He was educated in Switzerland and joined the navy in 1859.  He was soon in action on the Australian Station, serving under his father who was commander-in-chief.  The Maori War broke out in 1864, and both father and son distinguished themselves at their own levels.  Wiseman senior gained much credit and a knighthood for his resolute support of the army which had been pinned down by resourceful and determined opponents.  Midshipman Wiseman was part of a naval brigade, fought bravely, and was slightly wounded.  He was promoted to lieutenant and awarded the New Zealand medal.</p><p>In 1878 he married Sarah Elizabeth Langworthy.  They had three children:  Winifred (b1879), Dorothy (b1881), and William (b1885).</p><p>In 1881, now a commander, he was appointed in command of HMS  <em>Dwarf, </em>a composite gun vessel of 160 feet length overall and four guns, commissioned for the South East America Station.  With a complement of 85 officers and men Wiseman set off from Montevideo on 10 December 1881 to proceed to the Falkland Islands, where unscrupulous sealing ships, mostly American, had for some time been decimating the seal population.  Governor <a href=\"/biographies/kerr_thomas\">KERR</a> was in the process of passing a law to set up a conservation regime, and had requested a warship to stop poaching and enforce the new law.   <em>Dwarf  </em>arrived in Stanley on 23 December 1881, and Wiseman called on the Governor, who at once asked him for his Paymaster's assistance in going through the public accounts; the treasurer, JW <a href=\"/biographies/collins_john\">COLLINS</a>, was suspected of misappropriation, which indeed soon proved to be the case.  Wiseman then proceeded on a leisurely cruise around the Falklands, calling in at most settlements and meeting and describing many characters found elsewhere in this Dictionary, including Ernest <a href=\"/biographies/holmested_ernest\">HOLMESTED</a>, FE <a href=\"/biographies/cobb_frederick\">COBB</a>, Captain Robert <a href=\"/biographies/packe_robert\">PACKE</a>, the <a href=\"?q=node/147\">DEAN</a> family, Arthur <a href=\"/biographies/felton_arthur\">FELTON</a>, Captain Charles <a href=\"/biographies/hansen_charles\">HANSEN</a>, JF <a href=\"/biographies/hunziker_johann\">HUNZIKER</a>, and Bishop <a href=\"/biographies/stirling_waite\">STIRLING</a>. The cruise was successful in that the conservation law was established and enforced, with several sealers being warned off, and in addition there seems to have been plenty of time for parties, fishing, and above all shooting. </p><p>Wiseman's affectionate letters home to his wife during this period (published in 1995 as  <em>The Falklands and the Dwarf </em>) are a delight. They offer a fascinating insight into the Islands of that era, poised as they were between the early pioneering days and the steady prosperity, based on wool, that led up to the stirring events of World War I. Wiseman was observant, perceptive, witty, and mildly eccentric, and through his pen the place and its people become alive.</p><p>Wiseman was promoted to captain after his Falklands cruise, and returned to England.  His subsequent career looked promising:  he commanded a battleship, and seemed destined for flag rank.  However he was struck by pneumonia while sitting on a court-martial of Vice-Admiral Fairfax, who had been partly responsible for the loss of HMS  <em>Howe  </em>off <em> </em>Ferrol (Spain).  He should have reported sick, but this would have required the whole proceedings to have been started again, and he held on too long. He died on 11 January 1893.</p>",

        "body": "<p>architect, was born in St Lawrence, Kent on 2 November 1895, the only child of James Woodgate and Emily Helen, née Austen. During World War I, he served in the army and attained the rank of major. On 28 October 1918 he married Edith Mary Acock by whom he had three children, Betty Eileen (b1921),Yvonne Mary (b1923, who married Douglas <a href=\"/biographies/pole-evans_douglas\">POLE-EVANS)</a> and John James Austen (b1929). They lived after their marriage at Hythe, Kent. His wife died on 23 June 1929. He was married for the second time to Alice Eliza Hogg in the summer of 1929 - she would become known to Stanley residents as Peggy. They had another son Peter Austen (b1931).</p><p>Woodgate practiced as an architect in Folkestone (Kent) and was surveyor to the urban district council. Shortly before World War II, he was appointed superintendent of public works in Stanley, or executive engineer, as the post was then known. He and his wife arrived in the Falklands on the  <em>Lafonia </em>from Montevideo on 27 September 1939. The next day he was appointed commanding officer of the Falkland Islands Defence Force, a position he held throughout the war, first as major and later with the rank of lieutenant-colonel. Peggy had been a nurse and she played a large part, as he did, when HMSS  <em>Exeter, Ajax  </em>and <em>Achilles </em>were repaired in Port Stanley in December 1939 after the Battle of the River Plate. Woodgate was awarded the OBE in 1946. The Falkland Islands Weekly News, in announcing the honour, reported:</p><blockquote><blockquote>As 'O.C.' he has set an example of not only being an understanding officer in the general affairs of the Force, but also in doing all in his power to encourage the able man in the ranks. We congratulate him on the fact that he has been honoured by His Majesty the King with the Order of the British Empire.</blockquote></blockquote><p>In addition to his other duties in the Falklands, Woodgate also served from his arrival on both Executive and Legislative Councils and tribute was paid to him in 1947 as the longest-serving member of ExCo.</p><p>After leaving the Falklands in August 1947 he had several colonial appointments in Tanganika {Tanzania} and Uganda, where he designed the National Bank of India building in Kampala. He was also employed in Ghana, where he died on 25 April 1961.</p><p>A tall man, he was something of a sun-worshipper and a keen supporter of Rotary. He was a lover of Gilbert &amp; Sullivan and introduced their works to the Falkland Islands with a production of 'Trial by Jury' in 1943. He even christened his official accommodation in Stanley with the name the building still bears today, 'Gilbert House', in joking reference to 'Sulivan House' (spelt with one 'l', as in Admiral <a href=\"/biographies/sulivan_sir\">SULIVAN)</a> the colonial secretary's residence. His family took parts in his productions of several operas. On his departure the  <em>Weekly News </em>wrote:</p><blockquote><blockquote>As Col. and Mrs. Woodgate leave us to go to Tanganyika, we recall with pleasure the great help they gave in the delightful productions of 'Trial by Jury' and 'The Pirates of Penzance' in Stanley...there must have been a tremendous amount of work on the shoulders of the Colonel and his wife.... We recall Col.Woodgate's very kind and thoughtful act in inviting the elderly people in the town to an afternoon performance of 'The Pirates of Penzance'. The Weekly News extends its good wishes to Colonel and Mrs. Woodgate as they leave our shores for another Colony.</blockquote></blockquote><p>He loved working with wood and making furniture, conscious that several of his ancestors had been carpenters and joiners. He was also a talented draughts-man and produced many delicate and artistic drawings for government, showing his designs for proposed buildings. These drawings have been preserved and are now on display in the Falkland Islands Archives.</p>",

        "body": "<p>ornithologist and botanist, was born in Croydon, Surrey on 20 October 1936. His interest in natural history, especially birds, began in 1940 when his father gave him a copy of <em>The Observer's Book of British Birds.  </em>In 1953 he joined the Air Ministry Meteorological Office as a scientific assistant, and in 1956 with the possibility of interesting ornithology, he volunteered to work at Stanley, for the British Antarctic Meteorological Service, arriving in December.</p><p>Information on Falkland birds was collected from Falkland Islanders, through direct observations, photography, tape-recording and note-taking in the field. Trapping for ringing many bird species gave data on ring-sizes, age-related plumage changes and moults, site-faithfulness and longevity. Anne Stansbury who was working for the Colonial Education Service helped with fieldwork and the first draft of a bird guide; they were married in Christ Church Cathedral on 21 May 1958. Several expeditions to Kidney Island provided many opportunities for further study. Woods' 1970 paper in <em>Ibis  </em>on the avian ecology of this island was the first to document evidence of the importance of Tussac grass habitat to about half the Falkland breeding species. An exciting discovery in December 1961 (with Bob Reid, a VSO Camp teacher) was a pair of Great Shearwaters in a burrow on Kidney Island, the first proof of breeding in the Falklands.</p><p>The ringing scheme, trialled in 1960 by Roddy and Lily Napier at West Point Island for the bird-banding program of the United States Antarctic Research Program was at its height in 1962 and 1963 when Roddy, Robin and Anne ringed 3,000 near-fledged Black-browed Albatrosses <em>Thalassarche melanophrys  </em>each year. Recoveries were made off eastern South America north to Cape Frio, Brazil (23°S) with a few reaching 16°S on the coast of Angola and the Cape of Good Hope between two and a half and six months after fledging.</p><p>In Stanley and at nearby gull colonies, the Woods ringed about 1,300 gulls. Their son Alan (b1960) was a useful lookout and his shout of 'Gulls, Mummy!' resulted in clap netting and ringing many Kelp Gulls attracted to mutton bait in their garden. Several VSO teachers showed an interest and, with training and encouragement, ringed birds in the camp. Adding colour rings to Dolphin Gulls, Tussacbirds and Falkland Thrushes in Stanley and on Kidney Island enabled recognition of individuals without re-trapping, providing data on longevity, territorial ranges and distances travelled. About 180 adult Sooty Shearwaters and 70 White-chinned Petrels were ringed on Kidney Island and some re-caught in subsequent seasons. A Sooty Shearwater grounded in a Stanley garden was ringed in early May 1962 and 28 days later drowned in a fishing-net at Barbados, having flown at least 9,200km around the coast of Brazil at an average speed of 320km per day; the first record of a Falkland shearwater in the North Atlantic.</p><p>Woods was posted to RAF Lyneham, Wiltshire in 1963 and his son Martin was born in 1964. Needing a more fulfilling career, Woods left the Met Office. Anne Woods returned to teaching, Robin studied botany, zoology, geography and psychology and from 1974 he worked for Devon County Council as an educational psychologist in the Social Services Department. The bird guide had been completed but with a small potential market, most publishers did not consider it viable. <em>The Birds of the Falkland Islands  </em>with a foreword by Sir Peter <a href=\"/biographies/scott_sir\">SCOTT</a> was published in 1975 by Tony Nelson, a friend and former Camp teacher, and soon became a classic. With this book out of print, Robin was commissioned by Lord Buxton to write a second guide, <em>Falkland Islands Birds  </em>(published July 1982). At about the same time, Sir Peter Scott asked him to serve on the Advisory Council of the Falkland Islands Foundation, now Falklands Conservation (FC).</p><p>Revisiting the Falklands in 1983, Woods initiated a ten-year survey of breeding birds. He co-ordinated data collection from Falkland Islanders and visitors, collated and analysed the records and, with Anne, wrote the <em>Atlas of Breeding Birds of the Falkland Islands  </em>(1997)<em>.  </em>A desk study in 1985-86 of the 1:50,000 DOS Falklands maps listed at least 780 (not the oft-quoted 'about 200') islands in the archipelago, which has proved very useful for FC's Islands Database. His comprehensive <em>Guide to Birds of the Falkland Islands </em>came out in 1988, his guide to some important Falkland flowering plants was published by FC in 2000 and his plant collection has formed the basis of the Falklands National Herbarium. <em>Birds and Mammals of the Falkland Islands,  </em>a photographic guide written with Anne, was published by WildGuides in 2006.</p><p>Woods has served as a Trustee of FC from about 1993, Deputy Chairman (1999-2002) and Chairman (2002-2005). His scientific studies for over 50 years have contributed significantly to knowledge of the biodiversity of the Falkland Islands. He was elected a Fellow of the Linnean Society of London in 2005.</p>",

        "body": " <p>businessman, was born in London on 3 January 1891. In 1929, at a time of complete dependence of the Islands for passenger and cargo traffic on irregular calls by Pacific Steam Navigation Company (PSNC) vessels, a position which had existed since termination of the mail contract in 1917, it was desirable that the Falkland Islands Company appoint a new colonial manager with shipping experience. Such a man was Young who was recruited from India where he managed a shipping company. Young became colonial manager in 1929 and quickly reintroduced the Company's steamer, SS <em>Falkland,  </em>to external service involving voyages to Montevideo with the wool clip and to South Georgia. In 1930 he negotiated a mail contract with the Falklands Islands Government which enabled the Company to have a vessel specially built for the colony's needs. SS <em>Lafonia  </em>began service in 1931, making about eight voyages annually to Montevideo, seasonally connecting with Royal Mail Lines vessels there. Young was energetic and a strong disciplinarian who brought much needed changes to the Company's operations in the Islands. He also improved service conditions for staff, introducing particularly a provident fund scheme based on the level of dividend paid by the Company, and improved pensions. In 1936 it was decided to replace <em>Lafonia  </em>with a larger vessel and divert all overseas passenger and cargo trade to her whilst maintaining monthly sailings to Montevideo, thus ending partial reliance on PSNC. The <em>Southern Coast </em>was purchased in 1937 and renamed <em>Lafonia </em>, whilst the existing vessel of that name was renamed <em>Fitzroy </em>. Punta Arenas became a regular port of call and results were satisfactory for the improved service despite promises of cargo trade there made to Young by local shippers not being fulfilled, mainly because of strong opposition from the conference line which exercised their monopolistic position.</p><p>Young was appointed managing director of the Company in 1938 and made as his successor Captain DW <a href=\"/biographies/roberts_david\">ROBERTS</a>, the Company's senior shipping master, thus emphasizing the importance of shipping to the colony. The war years (1939-1945) were difficult ones for the colony and for Young with increased isolation following the early requisition of <em>Lafonia </em>and her loss in the North Sea. Young submitted to the Board in 1943 an outline of his postwar plans, which included a replacement for <em>Lafonia </em>, and a resurrection of his plan to operate a feeder service with PSNC in the Straits of Magellan without which it was difficult to justify operating two ships. He also strongly advocated the Company taking the initiative of informing the Falkland Islands Government that it was prepared to consider operating an internal air service after the war.</p><p>The Company and the colony found overcoming the arrears of maintenance and capital projects caused by isolation and shortage of materials during the war difficult. These problems were not helped by the ill-conceived erection of a freezer at Ajax Bay funded by the Colonial Development Corporation which Young bitterly opposed, particularly for its siting which created difficulties in transporting live sheep. This resulted in a difficult relationship between Young and Governor <a href=\"/biographies/clifford_sir\">CLIFFORD</a>. Young was a strong and very effective director of FIC, overcoming disagreements over farming policies between different family interests. He formed a strong relationship with John <a href=\"/biographies/cobb_john\">COBB</a>, the racing motorist and welcomed his appointment as chairman in 1951. He tried hard to persuade Cobb to abandon his attempt on the water speed record at Loch Ness only a fortnight after his appointment but to no avail. Cobb's death in the attempt dismayed Young who was appointed to succeed to the chairmanship, a position he held until retirement in 1958. Although never achieving his goal of breaking into the Latin-American market for shipping, Young did the Company and colony a great service when, following years of problems with cargo delays and losses through pilferage at Montevideo he introduced a charter service of vessels between the UK and Stanley with cargo outward and wool homeward. This transformed shipping results and reduced the subsidy for working RMS <em>Darwin </em>.</p><p>Young married Gladys Evangeline Matthews and they had three sons, William Hamilton (born in Bombay on 23 November 1920 and the only one with close links to the Islands), Timothy (b1922) and Christopher (b1926).</p><p>Young died at Bognor Regis on 13 October 1969.</p><p><a href=\"/biographies/barton_arthur\">See Image 22</a></p>",

He was educated at Charterhouse and followed his father's footsteps into the Colonial Service in 1877, becoming chief clerk to the government secretary in British Guiana {Guyana} in 1889. His subsequent career involved postings as assistant colonial secretary in Mauritius and acting colonial secretary then commissioner in the Turks and Caicos Islands ; administrator, Dominica , where he received the CMG in 1907; governor and commande...n-chief of the Leeward Islands , administrator and colonial secretary, St Lucia ; acting governor and commander-in-chief Windward Islands (May-December 1914).</p><p>The Falklands was his last posting and he arrived there in May 1915 with his sister (he never married). He arrived in the South Atlantic some five months after the Battle of the Falkland Islands and as a result saw a relatively quiet time in comparison to his contemporaries closer to the field of conflict. However, as the colonial secretary reported, the large quantities of whale oil and wool sent to the UK were a more important contribution to the needs of the Empire than the small contribution of manpower the colony could support. That contribution was nevertheless made, with 76 Falkland Islanders appearing on the Role of Honour for having seen active service for their country, nine of whom died during Young's term of office.</p><p>That Young was working hard is not in doubt - it was not until November 1916 that he made his first appearance at a community social event and then he chose a concert in aid of the Red Cross, its fund-raising credentials no doubt providing the spur to emerge from his office. Prior to that he was fortunate in his sister's presence to act in his stead at school prize-giving days. Despite the lack of military activity in the South Atlantic, Young worked hard for the war effort, introducing a measure to ensure that 10% of the colony's revenue was to be contributed to the Interest and Sinking Fund of the Imperial Loan.</p><p>It was to Governor Young that the honour fell to send the first telegraph message when the cable link with Montevideo was made on 29 August 1915. In true colonial style this was a message of 'assurance of their loyalty and devotion to His Majesty's Person'.</p><p>The event which put the Islands before the British public during Young's term of office was surprisingly nothing to do with the War, nor anything for which Young himself could take credit. In June 1916 Sir Ernest <a href=\"/biographies/shackleton_sir\">SHACKLETON</a> arrived in the Falklands to organise a rescue for his men after his epic voyage from Elephant Island to South Georgia. The Governor's contribution was to chair a public meeting at which Shackleton gave an account of the expedition and its heroic end.</p><p>Despite a somewhat undistinguished governorship Young was made a KBE in 1919. This was the first award of its kind to a serving governor while in office and was seen as much a reflection of the growing importance of the territory as a recognition of Young's personal contribution.</p><p>He and his sister left the Falklands on holiday on 27 September 1919 on the SS <em>Kenuta </em>. He was never to return and retired to the village of Nackington near Canterbury in 1920. He died on 7 March 1943.</p>",
